Bmr003_2578	I have to do ; that 's true ; but we haven't spent that , right ? ; But once we once we 've done the intellectual part of these , uh , we can just knock them out , right ?
Bro027_44	Um , ; but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . ; Yep . ; And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty .
Bro015_42	Oh so take a real VAD but apply it to to to the clean clean data . ; Uh g ; Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy . ; Mmm .
Btr002_235	boy , it 's hard to ig uh , ignoi that ignore that word . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , ; So y the example is , " That would be hard "
Bmr016_1398	In Monty Python you say " argh " a lot . ; Oh yeah ? ; So . ; Well , or if you 're a C programmer .
Bmr006_1298	Yeah . ; The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , ; No ? ; if they 're right next to one another ?
Bsr001_2570	That 's right , ; from volume . ; Yeah . ; That 's interesting .
Bmr024_1498	Yeah , but ; I mean , you know , they they will find boundaries a little differently , though ; You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . ; I 'd expect it to be a minor effect ,
Bro023_1526	And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , ; but if the time frame is long enough , uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , uh , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy . ; I 'm confused . ; Mmm ?
Bed010_687	I see this is this is getting into Ami 's thing . ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_393	Same thing . ; Anyway , uh , that we were that we 're gonna try to get a uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week . ; OK ? ; Alright .
Bed004_116	Like , there was a wizard for both uh both parts , ; is this right ? ; Yeah . ; It was bo it both times the same person .
Bro014_899	um ; well , to to obtain a statistical model on these features ; and to or just to use a neural network ; and hopefully these features w would help
Bro013_436	Mmm . ; OK . ; No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . ; But only to play .
Bro003_184	With ; So So Does i Just remind me of what what you were going to do with the what what what what 's ; y You just described what you 've been doing . ; Yeah .
Bed010_1051	saying " here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand " . ; And that we as a group will try to to finish it . ; What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday . ; Sure .
Bmr023_811	But the PLP features work um , uh , you know , continue to improve the , ; OK . ; um ; As I said before , the uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well .
Bmr022_980	If we had this style plug that went to that , then we 'd just have adaptors ; Right . ; and people would plug them in . ; You could use they could use their own .
Bed015_338	but ; That I I have no problem with it at all . ; It - it ; Yeah .
Bed003_392	yeah . ; navigational landmarks ; so ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_922	Now the f the fields are slightly different . ; So the main thing that the person fills out um is the name and email and time ? ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr031_1167	It 's actually not a bad idea to say " beep " as a word ; because you can search the transcripts , y you know , for for that , to find these places . ; For " beep " . ; That 's a good idea .
Bed009_825	Mm - hmm . ; So this is sort of came as a surprise to me that you know , embassy s is featuring a nice parser ; but it 's what I hear . One could also look at that and see whether there is some synergy possible . ; Mm - hmm , yeah ,
Bmr001_807	Right . ; Some errors , yeah . ; I don't know . ; I do I don't know the answer to that .
Bed005_1316	And , so , ; i ; uh ; But it 's , uh Well , it strikes me as a What For
Bmr007_441	In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap . ; Uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time ; and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " . ; Right .
Bro007_428	Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience , ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; So recognition performance is just the top part , actually .
Bed015_1567	So , I guess , ; it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever .
Bed017_302	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , uh , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch ; and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work
Bmr013_965	Yep . ; Good ; s I think that 's probably our agenda , or starting up there . ; Oh I wanted to ask one thing ,
Bro011_170	Yeah , slikes and send mails . ; u s ; Yeah . ; o o Yeah .
Bro005_1041	Um . How well do they stand up , over the ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling
Bmr007_1277	Oh ; So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ? ; You 'll lose it . ; There 's no way around that .
Bsr001_458	You won't be able to get funding . ; So ; Right ! ; No ,
Bro012_620	For uh Oh , for Eurospeech ? ; For th ; Yeah . ; So f only for the experiments on Aurora .
Bro010_767	and ; So . ; Yeah . ; I think . Yeah , I think Ericsson used this kind of threshold . Yeah ,
Bed012_529	Yeah , I didn't intend to say that every possible ; OK . ; There was a confusion there , ; k I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes - net ,
Bro024_1239	m ; uh , ; six thousand hidden nodes and two outputs . ; t t
Bro019_971	Originally the idea was from CMU . ; Mm - hmm . ; From C . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_575	There are some problems with the lapel mike . ; Of course . ; Yeah . ; Wow that 's great .
Bmr003_1447	" Gonna " or " wanna " , ; you know , the same thing . ; And and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation . ; How are you handling backchannels ?
Bsr001_1024	Yeah . ; So what do we do ? ; Well , I mean , ; It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects ,
Bmr030_784	Yeah , it feels funny , ; huh ? ; You 're a data fiend . ; If we have the capability .
Bmr020_925	Hmm . ; Interesting idea . ; So this training meeting , uh w un is that uh some data where we have uh very um , you know , accurate time marks ? for ; Great .
Bro003_1123	Right ? ; Because the putting them in combination , I think , is not as much computationally as the r training of the nets in the first place . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bed012_136	Well , actually , you don't even need to do that with XML . ; D Can't you just look at one specific ; No ; Yeah , exactly . The @ @ Xerxes allows you to say , u " Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . "
Bmr010_1298	yeah . ; um , ; it looks like , ; at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize
Bed003_140	Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from ; Like you m might be able to " Vista " it , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_373	Well , then ; except the ones who ; I mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_929	And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before uh , before we had the multiple audio available ; f ; so I couldn't switch between the audio . ; I I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely ,
Bed003_1072	As , like , lists of numbers . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_575	Yeah , ; So y so you ; if i ; m s Yeah ,
Bmr008_1066	Yeah . ; not the year but just their birthday . ; Not the year . ; I don't know ,
Bmr012_722	Alright ; it 's just that we 're ; we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts ; Great .
Bmr016_623	So if there was a segment of speech this long ; cuz ; Yeah . ; And someone said " oh " in the front in the middle .
Btr001_1425	and then you go up to this next level ; So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did ? ; and ; Oh , OK .
Bed014_584	Kind of a priming ; and you 're able to to conclude on it . ; Yeah . ; priming a spreading activation
Bsr001_297	So . ; Hhh . OK . ; But , uh , yeah , ; but it 's not such a it 's not such a directional microphone probably .
Bed004_661	And it 's perfectly OK to uh insist that that , you know , th um , they add up to one , ; but that there 's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Buw001_634	That 's wonderful . ; for every meeting . ; People who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_284	Yeah . ; Otherwise , I mean , what range are we gonna choose ; to to map everything into ? ; Well . It depends how much we wanna do gamesmanship and how much we wanna do
Bro027_423	but the features that the VAD neural network use are , uh , MFCC after noise compensation . ; Oh , I think I have the results . ; What was it using before ? ; Before it was just P L
Bmr003_1038	Yeah , ; so so my my search was pretty cursory . ; It was just a net search . ; And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that .
Bro007_369	yeah . ; Sure . ; But we have to decide ; I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best
Bmr027_527	I think it 's a good a good way of of fostering goodwill among our subjects . ; Well , our participants . ; I think the main thing is I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . ; Sending lots of spam .
Bmr018_1410	but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that , uh , you know , got our interest , ; and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference , ; Present . ; Yep .
Bed005_1498	because I s I I I 'm not quite sure whether we all think of the same thing or not , here . ; Well , you and I should talk about it . ; Yeah , uh - huh . ; OK .
Bmr028_791	the the ; Oh , OK . ; Th - t I 'm just ignorant about the sof software architecture of this thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_802	The turn - around time on the training when we train only the a male system with , uh , you know , our small training set , is less than twenty - four hours , ; so we can run lots of uh , basically just brute force , ; try a whole bunch of different um , settings . ; OK .
Bro027_1726	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So that
Bed014_549	So I guess In the short run , let 's let 's be real clear on h what the two alternatives would be . ; OK . ; And then the we had another idea floating around um , which we wanted to , uh , get your input on , ; and that concerns the
Bro023_1175	Um ; That 's the musical noise ? ; Which is musical noise , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2109	this is great " . ; Yep . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , to study using the same thing .
Bro021_2	 ; OK . ; Uh . ; Somebody else should run this .
Bro003_819	Um , TI - digits ; uh all these Aurora f d data p data is from is derived from TI - digits . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh . Oh OK .
Btr001_194	And so ; I was getting a little frustrated ; because I would put a lot of things into parentheses ; and then go back over it
Bed004_875	so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and and ; Oh yeah . ; No I I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at . ; Yeah .
Bro013_16	Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting . ; So . ; The both the uh the SRI System and the oth ; Um .
Bmr028_465	But , I mean , he 's basically gone . ; Oh , OK . ; Cold calling at lunch time ? Uh , dinner time , I mean . ; Well , if I could find phone numbers , that would certainly work .
Bro026_33	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , I I don't think anybody up there is like working on it right now . ; Mmm . ; I think it more likely that what it means is that when Sunil is up there he will grab it .
Bro024_1361	at least want to retrain on these alignments , ; which should be better because they come from close - talking microphone . ; Yeah , ; the that was my idea .
Bdb001_1278	But unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it . ; OK ? ; OK , then ; But they 've also
Bro026_505	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_509	OK . ; Yeah . So . ; I was just wondering because that test you 're t ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_926	Why is that ? ; right ? ; I don't know . ; Well I don I mean if it 's any better
Bmr020_355	That 's ; I j was just wondering . ; Yeah . ; That 's me .
Bmr031_519	Well , that might help a bit . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , actually I think at NIST they were ta there were there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too , ; Well , with NIST I think
Bro005_1219	right ? ; Yeah , but ; Yeah . ; So , yeah , but we 've
Bmr013_121	Although the models weren't , that good , ; right ? ; I mean , the models are pretty crappy ? ; You 're right .
Bdb001_203	Yeah , I mean , for something like that I would use P - file ; or or any frame - level stuff I would use P - file . ; Meaning ? ; Uh , that 's a well , or something like it .
Bed016_803	So " running out of it " definitely has a process aspect to it . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that 's from run , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_671	I don't know if Adam has has a preference , ; But but ; but we could have you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American , ; We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization .
Bsr001_581	to do all my work . ; Oh , you 're a ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bmr006_35	Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? ; Is it ; Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up . ; Um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data
Buw001_2284	Yeah . ; When when did people laugh ? ; That 's great . ; Find me a funny thing that Jeff said .
Bmr006_594	The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , you know , fifty percent more . ; How much ; Is there a difference in price or something ? ; Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave ,
Bed011_708	but ; Yeah . ; OK . ; but I think other things you can , if I remember right .
Bmr003_1420	Yeah . ; They they have several options . ; So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . ; Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary .
Bro011_671	where did six come from ? ; Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . ; Yeah . ; You know ,
Bed004_586	Right . ; But it 's not construction there , it 's action . ; Construction is a d is a different story . ; Yeah .
Bro027_331	Right . ; and then this they 're going to run some evaluations . ; So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1071	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and we don't know what people are doing . ; Try to create a paper out of that .
Bmr027_727	No . But anyway ; Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . ; But And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know , ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1321	You know , have a have a couple Markov models ; Yeah . ; and ; and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap .
Bmr016_319	Right . ; So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . ; Mmm , oh , OK . ; Oh OK .
Bro027_267	No ; Well , I haven't grabbed that one yet . ; So there 's two . ; Oh , there is another short sample set
Bns002_603	Mm - hmm . ; and and the opposite works also . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ,
Bmr008_554	Well , that 's true . ; You 'd just leave them . ; I mean , Indian English I wouldn't know f ; You don't even ask .
Bro019_862	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; How is it ; I I guess I 'm ignorant about this ,
Bro021_1049	I mean , C equals A plus B , ; It 's log o of capital Y . ; Yeah , right . ; and then
Bmr022_415	Know ; Those transcriptionists need to know their place . ; Oh . ; Well , no no no no .
Bmr018_716	and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis , ; Yeah . ; but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap . ; It 's not really something you could scientifically say is overlap ,
Bdb001_1015	I mean , if you do " man P - file " or " apropos P - file " , you 'll see a lot . ; True . ; I 've used the P - file , I think . ; I 've looked at it at least , briefly , I think when we were doing s something .
Bro023_1086	They use spectral subtraction , ; right . ; For what ? ; French Telecom .
Bmr005_422	Wi - but uh , without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , ; and the zone with the three speakers . ; That would j just be one . ; It One . One .
Bmr002_954	It uses Snack . ; That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with . ; OK , then we 'll have to use it . ; Oh , cool .
Btr001_1323	The IBM ones were the ones that came in huge , huge paragraphs , huh ? ; Yes ! ; Yeah , and we had to split them up . ; See , I never got one of those .
Bed005_502	I see . ; And it and it runs around looking for Discourse Status tags , ; and doing whatever it does with them . ; And other people ignore those tags .
Bmr023_1081	So . I um . ; Yeah . There could be a bug in in the somewhere before that . ; There we could ; the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ?
Bed003_666	However you know , it The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities ; but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so th
Bmr002_501	Mm - hmm . ; What 's her name ? ; Uh uh Doctor Susan Ervin - Tripp . ; OK .
Bro012_775	so . ; And the sentence contain only one word , which is " Due " ; And it can't clearly be seen . ; Where where is it ?
Bmr030_781	Cuz u ; I just hate not to get data . ; How m ; Yeah , it feels funny ,
Bmr020_146	Yeah . ; I think several people sent this , ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_615	I 'm thinking prior to that . ; What 's LDC ? ; Was there ever any talk of taking the , um , close - talking mikes when people aren't talking and deleting those portions ? ; Linguistic Data Consortium .
Bmr007_707	Yeah . ; Yes . ; Linguistic anthropologists would would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting . ; There 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah .
Bmr024_139	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1159	So . ; So maybe just briefly , uh ; Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1907	Yeah . ; So on ; Tah - dah ! ; I don't know .
Bmr018_531	Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster . ; Well , I mean , that 's the i I I think that might be a personal style thing . ; I find it really convenient the way the way it 's set up right now . ; Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly " well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan " , right now , you have to go up to the menu ,
Bmr027_1385	Um . ; Not here , but later today ? ; We should probably talk off - line about when we 're gonna talk off - line . ; OK . OK .
Bed013_1324	Um . ; Think Uh , well this is just a mental exercise . ; Yeah . ; If you think about ,
Bmr027_1270	OK . We just need to ; Well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes . ; So . ; OK .
Bed006_320	Using this new new um plan , ; data . ; New new set up . ; OK .
Bro012_361	It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , ; it 's a weighted mean of improvements . ; Uh - huh . ; So .
Bro027_1717	I see . ; so the neural ; so that is coming from a separate neural net or some VAD . ; OK .
Bed015_181	Fine , we can change it " . ; It 's g it 's gone . ; But I I I 'm starting to like it again . ; So that that 's why That 's why I 'll stick with it .
Btr002_629	but that 's a different problem , ; um , except for those cases , it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear . ; I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1127	Yeah . ; It probably won't do any better . ; You probably won't notice a difference . ; But it 's I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed .
Bsr001_1133	So . ; And then , uh , UW ; I don't know if you mentioned this at the beginning ; but , the Mari 's group , Mari and Morgan I th I think what happened historically , um
Bmr031_233	or room - adapted ; or whatever . ; Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is . ; H how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus ?
Bmr025_1003	W uh We ordered uh more wireless , ; and so they should be coming in at some point . ; Great . ; And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion
Bed002_1081	OK . ; I have no idea whether that 's ; The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_107	So , ; Right . ; Well , I don't know , ; perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt
Bed006_1511	If you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier . ; Uh yeah wait ; This is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions . ; R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine .
Bro014_1172	But it 's this , ; Oh , yeah . ; This is ; but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation
Bro012_798	So C - zero is very clean , actually . ; Yeah . ; Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , ; though it is not .
Bmr023_1148	because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . ; So , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . ; So in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . ; And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant .
Buw001_2134	OK . ; We 're just compiling the list . ; I see . ; I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me .
Bed015_510	what is " ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So time and space .
Bed009_98	yep . ; Great . ; So , you guys enjoy your weekend ? ; Yes , very much so .
Bro022_234	OK . ; I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way ; so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech . ; Hmm .
Bed009_365	Well uh Marcus Lerkult is actually implementing that stuff ; and Marcus and Michael together are um leading the discussion there , ; OK . ; yeah .
Bns001_324	and then I have a normal WaveLAN connection , right ? ; Yes . ; And the router and the WaveLAN connection goes into the core internet elsewhere ; and the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off I would like to say .
Bdb001_430	well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it . ; OK . ; I don't ; So this is what the meeting 's about ,
Bmr016_700	Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation ; which I don't know enough about to talk about . ; Uh - huh . ; It just it just to r to remove cross - talk .
Bed003_1431	Mm - hmm . ; huh ? ; just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , ; you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those .
Bmr003_1578	OK , ; so normalization ; So , s ; I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels ,
Bro011_755	eh ; Um i it 's a little behind , ; like Matlab , or ? ; it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like um
Bro027_1990	so next week I won't , ; and the week after I won't , ; cuz I 'll be in Finland . ; And the week after that I won't .
Bmr019_1099	I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper . ; Well , I 'm no We may be in the same position , ; and I figured we 'll try , ; because that 'll at least get us to the point where we have We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that
Bro017_708	Because essentially you are saying " uh this feature is not important " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or less important , ; so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one ,
Bmr016_2077	because one 's in the context of a you know , a transcribed word string , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; The other thing is you can get really so minute with these things
Bmr024_249	Yeah , uh , ; so twenty hours . ; But I guess the other thing is that , um , that that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_100	uh , say the day before . ; Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro013_345	Mm - hmm . ; because it it ; well , this VAD ; uh either some delay
Bmr009_536	Yeah . ; aha ! OK . ; Yeah , I was just saying ; I I I I understood uh that eh I I had to finish by the moment with the and and concentrate my my energy in that problem .
Bed015_125	at least ; Yeah . None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? ; But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , ; right ? which here are the constructs , to say something about the relation .
Bns002_1086	It 's uh ; You 'll know to remove h it 's h from the header , in principle , and and so on , until it uh reaches the final destination . ; OK . ; OK .
Bns002_112	OK . ; That 's perfect , you know . ; Yeah . ; This in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway , from this network to connect to other networks ,
Btr001_370	that way . ; Yeah , ; interesting . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1399	And what 's the top frequency of each ? ; Well , now it 's the same . ; It 's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1398	Yeah there 's I I think there are some meetings where it would would It 's possible like this . ; Yeah I I think , we won't know until we generate a bunch of beep files automatically , listen to them and see how bad they are . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_481	Yeah . ; And the reason is because I think there 's a limit there 's an upper bound on how many you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility . ; When we speak we we do make a judgment of " can " you know , as adults . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_604	Mm - hmm . ; but ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro016_64	And I guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of Gaussians , ; Right . ; but , um , ; let 's just
Bed006_1677	a ; Yep . ; So ; That 's wonderful .
Bed003_1341	um , you know , um still , based on that result is never going to enter that building . ; Hmm . ; You know ? ; Because it 's just too expensive .
Bro028_811	I mean , in the idea of of normalizing ; Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr001_623	I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You just can't listen .
Buw001_710	Mm - hmm . ; So , uh ; But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , ; and get all the standards , and to do anything with it .
Bmr029_694	since they 're individual utterance files , um , s long silence periods are removed , ; which is a good thing . ; Because this method might estimate the mean badly , if it had to face long silence periods . ; But that does mean that I need as much I need twice as much disk space as the original set
Bed016_693	Well , ; We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . ; Well there actually ; the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , uh , from our domain .
Bed013_5	Whew ! ; I almost forgot about the meeting . ; I woke up twenty minutes ago , thinking , what did I forget ? ; It 's great how the br brain sort of does that .
Bed008_1405	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So H passes a vector on to the next node ? ; It could .
Bro028_894	Cuz we you know , one thing that w that , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , uh , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about , ; and it was really just sort of setting of different constants .
Btr002_3226	So , if you 're doing you 're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel , ; I don't think I 've made that explicit ; but it w it 's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context . ; And at that point what I sometimes pick up is this meta - level , where someone is finishes someone 's someone else 's utterance .
Bns002_318	OK ? ; So ; in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh , used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept a reception is taking place . ; OK ?
Bmr001_284	Yeah , right . ; but someone has to write some software to to actually do it . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr002_346	Oh , you 're meant You 're meant to speak naturally . ; You 're meant to say " Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! " ; Ah right . ; Yeah .
Bed010_805	Yeah uh exactly . ; So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . ; S ; Well , Dan Montello sort of ,
Bed016_1060	or something like that , ; Do you really say that ? ; which a tourist w ; Huh ?
Bmr018_1361	The - their Broadcast News was their acoustic models ; And then they went to ; and then all the other tasks were much simpler . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1333	Yeah . ; So Um . ; Th - that 's that 's true . ; And good ones ,
Bro027_142	OK . ; Well , maybe it 's not a big deal . ; But , um ; Anyway , that was just something we wondered about .
Bmr010_119	Yeah . ; Do I I hear you you didn't ; Speech - nonspeech ? ; Uh - huh .
Bed005_699	W we 'll we 'll look at that , ; but uh ; I 'd be s I I 'd be surprised at ; if there 's any important issue that that
Bmr027_1061	Um , then you get down here . ; Um . ; Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . ; That 's the next example ,
Buw001_1170	you think ? ; m i Even if that much ? ; Uh , less . ; Less .
Bro003_988	t I mean , these are a lot of these are built - in things ; and we know we have programs that compute PLP , ; we have MSG , ; we have JRA
Bmr007_1018	I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh um , mike mixers automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain , you know , uh as much as you can , you you you lower the gain on on the mikes of people who aren't talking , ; Mmm . ; Yeah Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr022_1131	Well , and just You , then , also just have the general problem of permission on the other files , ; that , do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error , and correcting it , ; or do they wa do you want it to go through you ? ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro027_442	Is that nine frames u s uh , centered around the current frame ? Or ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; S so , I 'm I 'm sorry ,
Bmr022_1080	And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues . ; That right now , lots of people create the files ; and then we have group " Meeting Recorder " . ; But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder group can overwrite the files .
Bed011_1154	Probably should go . ; That was that 's one you should probably go to . ; Yep . ; How much does it cost ?
Bro003_685	MSG . ; Uh , JRASTA . ; JRASTA . ; And JRASTA - LDA .
Bsr001_1843	Mm - hmm . ; And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . ; Yeah . ; So basically it seems to be like , uh ,
Bmr016_120	Right . ; and that 's always a good thing . ; It 's a little bit better for me too ; Yep .
Bmr023_670	but it 's s ; Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . ; Yeah . ; I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time .
Btr001_804	Have you ; I guess I 'm the only non - linguist . ; Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid , ; so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this ,
Bns002_731	OK ? ; And they are controlling the power to eh this g uh mmm get this this number of neighbors , ; but this is not what I am doing ; and uh the kind of power control I am doing uh , um , is more or less presented here ,
Bmr016_1774	I 'm sorry ! ; So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . ; Oh , sorry . ; What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation " tickle " for TCL as a word .
Bns001_659	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; It is only um what the gateways get . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_605	and he pretty much said " yeah , you could do that if you want " ; but he thought it was a bad idea . ; In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing uh NW archive to copy it is a good idea ; and we should do that and have it backed up .
Bro019_497	and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . ; Mm - hmm . ; And ; So , I 've been actually running some s
Bmr024_1358	And so , uh , there 's the question ; I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . Well , the likelihoods are
Bmr025_425	Right . ; Right . ; And so and also I 'd like to do the indirect time line business . ; Um but regardless , I mean , w that 's something that you , me , and Jane can talk about later .
Bro026_670	It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . ; Yeah . ; So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1482	yeah ? ; Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak ? ; I have . ; But not transcontinentally .
Bro013_531	Nothing . ; Yeah so it 's ; And the ; doesn't do too well there .
Bro024_1796	OK . ; Carmen ? ; Do you , uh ; Well , I only say that the this is , a summary of the of all the VTS experiments
Bro026_636	after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . ; It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me . ; But , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . ; That would be , uh put us in an awkward position .
Buw001_1280	But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and generate some queries . ; Yeah . ; Of course Jane doesn't need to . ; I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now .
Bed002_32	So . ; You can see the transcript ? ; There 's two large number strings on the digits ? ; So you would just read that one .
Bmr024_596	S ; No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? ; We wer we just wanted to do ; Right .
Bns002_411	because this is the next next scope of the transmission area , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then he can send the data , right ? ; OK .
Bmr006_927	This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . ; And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data ; Supervised clustering . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2268	and they don't The contour is really not nearly that neat . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist .
Bmr010_996	Uh - huh . ; Oh , no . ; Is that good or bad ? ; Well , they they 're very perce
Bed013_1302	Those are the two interpretations , right ? ; the the ones that are location or path . ; So , you could say that the s construction is a question asking about this location , ; and then you can additionally infer , if they 're asking about the location , it 's because they wanna go to that place ,
Bmr006_1402	And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . ; Yeah . ; And they had very precision . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1589	yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true , ; Yep . ; but but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case , ; but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different ,
Bmr018_988	And my hope was that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it . ; Right . ; But if we can't ; That was everybody 's hope .
Bro008_215	So ; Yeah , ; it 's very short interval . ; yeah .
Bed015_1285	So that 's A . ; OK . ; But B , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_145	you know , as usual they 're before and ends . ; I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation ; but in form you might also have a value binding . ; You know , you could say that , um , you know , " name - one dot " , t you know , " number equals " , you know , a plural or something like that .
Bmr027_168	Oh , those are the NSA meetings ? ; Those are ; The non - native ; Yeah . Uh - huh .
Bmr027_750	Uh - huh . ; So ; Hide it . ; Here we go .
Bro023_179	Mm - hmm . ; And they are , like , pretty short . ; Pretty short . ; Shor
Buw001_2158	Mark 's aware of those , too . ; " Hey , look what we found ! " ; OK . ; That would be found data
Bed014_863	Yeah , and I would like to d discuss it ; and ; and , you know , get you guys 's input ; Right .
Bro004_526	OK ; so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages ; and it and I was seeing that it got worse . ; I I think that was all it was .
Bro013_760	But people wouldn't know what that wa ; I mean there is no convention for it . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3244	Wait . ; We add the ; So , if so in the examp i in the instance in which ; Let 's say that , um , Morgan 's talking ,
Bns002_1115	So , I see this like a you know , a a topic I 'm not convinced about . ; I don't trust you can really provide quality of service , ; but of course ; That depends on the service level you want to be .
Bro014_1424	so . ; So , yeah , ; probably ; So in that case , it might not make much difference at all .
Bmr013_391	yeah . ; Yeah . ; an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . ; Yeah .
Bed006_945	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; and and all in a v very easy e homogenous framework . ; So you know happen to know how what what " sooner or later " means like in practice ?
Bmr028_1183	As of February ? ; A a as of ; no , a little ; I don't know .
Bsr001_2133	Hmm ! ; It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1584	Mmm . ; and I usually assume that , um , the words are mostly right , ; although I g you know , I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right , ; but usually it 's like , punctuation and capitalization and other things that I 'm end up changing .
Bmr025_44	Um and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . ; OK . ; OK , wh ; I also got anot a short remark to the transcription .
Btr002_457	and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance ; or you go to the mixed channel , ; or you , uh , check on the other things ; and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear .
Bro018_301	Somebody 's preparing . ; Really ? ; Yeah . ; I forget what it 'll be ,
Bmr002_633	but I wasn't interested in that particular issue . ; Mm - hmm . ; a a is this ; So , we 're talking now , once you have words you know , how do you time align it .
Bmr006_1447	Hats ? ; In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do . ; Shirts . ; So if if Jose is interested in that , that 's great .
Bro022_68	Soon . ; Yeah . ; D - Day . ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_11	It 's your right to remain silent . ; Yeah . ; So I I the the problem is that I actually don't know how th these held meetings are held , ; if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what 's going on
Bmr024_1168	Oh . ; That wasn't me . ; Um . well , ; Uh .
Bro011_237	So um I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas ; like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . ; Oh um ; Well um I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today
Bro003_815	Spanish ; Oh , Spanish stories ? ; Albayzin is the name . ; What about TI - digits ?
Bro003_839	No . Albayz ; Spanish something . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro024_1686	Uh , yeah , ; I could try this . ; Um . ; And
Bro018_1090	well I tried this mean subtraction method . ; Um . ; Due to Avendano , I 'm taking s um six seconds of speech , ; um I 'm using two second FFT analysis frames , stepped by a half second
Bed015_2242	The pressure 's on you Nancy . ; Liz actually said she likes four ; because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know the discussions short . ; OK .
Bmr016_1824	Mm - hmm . ; And then , yeah , in the case of " tickle " I guess we would just have a , you know , word " TCL " which ; Mm - hmm . ; You add it to the dictionary .
Bmr018_701	So there 's either the beginning , mostly the beginning word , where th you , um , you know , Chuck talks somewhere into the segment , ; but the first , um , word of what he says , often " I " ; but it 's very reduced " I , " ; that 's just aligned to the beginning of someone else 's speech , uh in that segment ,
Bro005_324	For this case , right ? ; Um . ; Alright . ; So , um So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you uh does not help in that case .
Bro023_1384	Oh ! ; which ; Sorry . ; A quick question just about the latency thing .
Bed011_212	They 're redundant . ; T to build a system that um had the most data on a relatively confined set of things , you do something else . ; And the speech people , for example , are gonna do better if they if things come up uh repeatedly . ; Now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting .
Bro021_987	and then ; Yeah , but the the second expression that you put is the first - order expansion of the nonlinear relation between ; Not exactly . ; No .
Bmr021_792	and other than that the system configuration was identical . ; So it was the same ; They came up with um you know , same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster ; Um , same The clustering used the same information loss threshold ,
Bro019_1516	And he wanted to look at um , how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum ; and compare that to the to the listener tests . ; And , um . ; So , I gave him a PLP spectrum .
Bro013_539	Right . ; So now I wonder ; I mean , do you want to ; I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum
Bro008_219	So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was like a week and a half , is is because of bugs like that . ; So ; Huh ; So , we 're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the
Bed013_240	excuse me , twenty times . ; OK . So , is it t comes to twenty billion or something ? ; Yes . ; That 's pretty big , though .
Btr001_1855	I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . ; And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are ; Yeah . ; and , " Oh , you were so funny in that meeting "
Bro014_236	yeah . ; So the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions . ; Um , ; it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting .
Bed006_1678	Yep . ; So ; That 's wonderful . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1068	So so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ? ; Not before having one come here and have some people try it out . ; OK . ; Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .
Bmr020_1886	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's the same problem as the lapel mike . ; Yeah . ; But
Bed012_605	Um , ; I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , ; but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later . ; But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess ,
Bmr018_731	Um - hmm . ; I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it . ; and the but there are some issues of this timing , um , in the recordings ; Yeah .
Bro027_382	So . ; OK , ; that 's fine . ; Should be OK .
Bmr029_26	uh , I think Chuck 's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff , it took maybe a day and a half ; to do the training . ; To retrain ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_974	Not a I 'm not saying there 's not a far - field microphone , uh , application , ; but ; If we have a choi I 've always wondered how well they would work . ; It is an interesting idea .
Bmr010_428	uh , transcript tied to a single channel , uh , audio . ; Mm - hmm . ; Have , uh , folks from NIST been in contact with you ? ; Not directly .
Bsr001_1346	Yeah . ; Mmm ! ; So . ; Right .
Bro007_232	Ye ; But words well word I don't know . ; Hmm ? ; The words , yeah .
Bro013_419	So that means logically , in principle , it should be better . ; So probably it 'll be worse . ; Yeah ; Or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality .
Bmr027_578	Mm - hmm . ; You know , they 're all more or less here ; or it 's it 's Eric and Dan and so on . ; But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work ,
Bmr028_8	I mean , I sent you a couple things , ; although I don't remember them . ; You only sent me one thing , which was demo status . ; And asking which one we were on this week .
Bmr011_1465	So . ; Yeah , so I mean there 's possibilities there . ; I think Jerry 's group , yes . ; Uh , there 's there 's , uh , the networks group ,
Bmr016_2021	it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . ; And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . ; Oh OK . ; Label it .
Bmr011_66	Uh , we started running recognition on one conversation ; but it 's the r isn't working yet . ; So , ; OK .
Bro018_210	Fifty - six I think . ; O ; Is that maybe that 's accuracy ? ; Percent .
Bmr010_1231	OK . ; We 're running a little short here . ; We , uh , uh , cou trying to ; That 's fine .
Bmr005_914	How many ? ; Eh , not @ @ I ; Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the ; Yeah .
Bed011_658	Mm - hmm ; Yep . ; So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment , ; " Dine out " is
Bmr027_1238	Yeah , we know disk space is short . ; Yeah . That 's what I thought too . ; That 's a great ambiguity . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_837	It does take up less disk space , ; and apparently it did even better than the original than the original versions , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_827	Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it 's Robert 's . ; I 've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions , ; Like . ; so we 'll we 'll find a way .
Bmr006_202	because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards . ; Well ; Oh . ; But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that
Bed014_1285	Yeah . ; like " This make you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . ; This makes no sense . " ; And he 'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing
Bed010_665	right ? ; Yeah . ; As sort of " from where I 'm standing it would appear that " ; Yeah .
Bro008_238	Uh , well that 's um ; Hmm ? ; yeah ; I mean , I think the question is " Is there is there some advantage ? "
Bro005_119	Mm - hmm . ; and uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , ; uh , so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1723	He was running through these models very quickly . ; He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was , ; in his recognitions . ; The only problem
Bed006_592	Mm - hmm , ; mm - hmm . ; and so you take one look at it and then you say " well that 's really nothing there 's nothing for me there " ; " what 's running in the cinemas ? "
Bed006_1726	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; H But w we 'll see that then , and how how it sort of evolves . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1661	but it 's smoothed ; Ah . ; Oh , it w it was you . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr009_378	There are there are different types , ; and within those types , ; like as Jose was saying , that sounded like a backchannel overlap , ; meaning the kind that 's a friendly encouragement , like " Mm - hmm . " ,
Bro012_379	Uh . ; So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ? ; Uh improvement ? ; No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,
Bro028_238	Yeah . Mmm . ; Um , ; so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ? ; Uh , yeah .
Bed015_410	Right ? ; So there 's going to be some extra you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now . ; Mm - hmm . ; By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back .
Bmr010_175	which I compared . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And so you change parameters .
Bro023_423	Italian ? ; yeah . ; And what did ; So , what was the , um , uh , corresponding number , say , for , um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ?
Bmr018_1168	and see ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's what I was gonna say . ; Yeah , that 's the problem with the NSA speakers .
Bed002_972	so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely . ; w What are the t three intentions ? ; Is it to go there , to see it , and ; To come as close as possible to it .
Bed010_39	so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . ; Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some some sentences .
Bro019_876	Oh , oh , OK ; so the difference is the KL . ; So , the the different ; the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad .
Bro026_805	Uh . ; Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , " Hari , hopefully this is OK with you " . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro025_200	So that 's kind of an argument for that . ; We do still , however , have to consider its latency . ; So the issue is is , um , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ? ; Right .
Buw001_664	Mm - hmm . ; Because someone ; and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . ; someone later might be able to take these and say " OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there
Bmr028_1169	which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on Hub - five . ; So , um . We haven't tried that yet on the meetings , ; uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too . ; I wanna ask , um So , you know that the data I ' v I have upgraded it considerably .
Bro021_654	and an epsilon cubed over three , ; and so forth . ; So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges . ; Oh .
Bmr026_197	because the um ; Yep . ; we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the ; Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack ,
Bed002_787	And and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . ; So you actually see that . ; Um . The uh , ; um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg .
Bmr019_189	Mm - hmm . ; Well , Adam knows how to run it , ; and try it out on TI - digits . ; Yeah . No problem .
Bed009_1071	And then , ; uh ; The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera , ; and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take .
Bmr005_565	I 'm not sure eh by the moment , ; but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh ; for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh , eh eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_443	an um ; tell them which things are near each other ; and ; you know , any of that stuff .
Bmr031_1114	And then you have an , uh you know , an a tag attribute ; and the value of that encodes the choice . ; Right . ; Right .
Buw001_1064	But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . ; Hmm . ; w ; But , you know , if you get even one
Bro013_547	right ? ; Um . ; Yeah . ; Well , this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter ,
Bro003_110	Yeah . ; Won't even do that . ; I mean , just go down Martin Luther King . ; Yeah .
Bro013_428	OK . ; Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um voiced - unvoiced stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; And next week I think we will perhaps try to have um a new system with uh uh MSG stream also
Bro012_911	So I think , ; yeah . ; For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition . ; Yeah . So basically you want to reduce this effect .
Bmr003_1273	I see . ; Good . ; Yeah , no , that I I would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that ; OK .
Bed016_253	You have to change those strategies , ; OK . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1469	OK . ; uh , I don't ; Do they still meeting regularly ; or ?
Bed010_15	and , I think got a lot done . ; Yeah , I think so too . ; Um . ; The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like " Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . "
Btr002_3235	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And I think those are interesting , ; so when I find that I I note note it as , you know , finishing
Bro027_139	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr008_328	Yeah . ; I don't know . ; It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes . ; Yeah .
Bro017_122	And so , so now they want to say " we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . " ; Hmm . ; And uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed . ; And so last time uh during the meeting , I just uh brought up the issue ,
Bro024_1240	uh , ; six thousand hidden nodes and two outputs . ; t t ; OK .
Bmr014_511	and so they 'll be a difference in commas , ; but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . ; And I have t ten minute stretch where I can where I can show that . ; And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon ,
Bed013_621	Johno will send you a link . ; Oh , you have a link . OK . OK . ; I got an email . ; OK .
Bmr012_316	yeah , I mean ; right ? ; There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . ; Yeah .
Bed013_88	Yeah you c if you want , you can have two parallel machines um , asking each other . ; What would that give us ? ; Would A be something completely weird and strange , ; and B , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions ,
Bed005_796	Well , I mean ; yeah , I d ; And this is It seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l this is special case in that sense . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_837	No . ; Spanish ; No . Albayz ; Spanish something .
Bro027_1804	it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . ; Yeah . ; Oh - eee - hhh . ; So , like , it 's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech
Bmr001_430	Oh , we 'll do the higher math later , maybe but it 's so it 's so maybe like a gig or two a an hour , ; um but um ; Yeah . ; OK , that is a bit more than I thought .
Bmr016_2088	And we could always add it later . ; Percent 's easy to detect . ; Point however is is uh a word that has a couple different meanings . ; And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings ,
Bro015_211	Um . So the the other thing that that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is ; um ; Oh ! ; The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state .
Bmr022_314	I don't remember . " ; And so , you know , a couple times they got it wrong . ; And there are some cases where there 's , um , very little speech before you hear a beep . ; So you hear a little bit of speech , beep ,
Bmr031_1146	So . ; And then , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; preparing for quals .
Bns003_32	and , as I mentioned before , probably will be more than fifty percent , I would like to say , that I will be come back to get the freedom to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form and get , in principle , paid by another project within Siemens . ; So the point is how long I will stay . ; I believe , a couple of months definitely ; and based on the success , I think that 's always an ongoing process to go back to uh , to Germany for a couple of weeks
Bmr016_81	as opposed to connected digits . ; Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , ; but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff . ; Yeah
Btr001_67	Mm - hmm . ; once you learn what it is , and you can say , " OK I know what they meant by that " ; or " I know how to spell that now " ; or something like that .
Bmr023_415	That 's great . ; So . ; Um . Yeah . I think it 'd be interesting to combine these . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1982	you don't know that they 're not participating in the same conversation at all . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_313	Um . ; Mmm . ; So Yeah , I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay . ; So what 's the ? If you ignore
Bro014_1041	So you essentially take the values that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them ; S ; to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1309	Uh , the next , ; um ; So is the is the is the training is the training based on these labels files which you take as reference here ? ; Oh , it 's there .
Bmr019_156	So ; Yeah , I think I did , actually . ; So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_729	like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " . ; And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times . ; Sh ; And Chuck 's on the lapel here ,
Bmr021_546	just the backed up space , ; or ? ; Well , both need to be reorganized . ; OK .
Bmr010_1053	We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times . ; Right ? ; One for each participant . ; So they could by hand
Bmr006_678	I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it . ; Because you have the the the distribution , now . ; But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . ; I 've seen it already .
Bro012_470	Out of what ? ; I mean . s ; Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , ; and we go to ninety - four point O four .
Bro028_91	No . ; No . ; OK . ; It 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the MIPs , I think it fits ,
Bro018_550	and uh um basically just another method for doing classification . ; And so I 'm gonna apply that to um compare it with the results by um King and Taylor who did um these ; um ; using recurrent neural nets , they recognized um a set of phonological features
Bmr015_95	Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . ; So those are those are the two options . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_413	The other thing that that , uh of course , what Barry was looking at was was just that , ; the near versus far . ; And , yeah , the adaptation would get th some of that . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_968	S ; Yeah . ; And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says " and " versus " nnn " versus , you know , " nd " , whatever ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_115	And it 's not due until like May fifteenth . ; Oh this isn't the Aurora one ? ; It 's another one ? ; No .
Bro007_258	right ? ; So so it wouldn't mean anything . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1482	Yes . ; I don't know . ; I 'm sorry , ; but
Bed015_516	Good . ; And ; you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , ; and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now .
Btr001_1559	I You know , I feel I feel like it was , um , more personal . ; I was ; It was more personal . ; You know , the n This is sort of just , you know , correcting other
Bns003_833	And progress , it 's going on , ; but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh ,
Bro026_353	But everything is within the range of one one percent . ; Yeah , one percent . ; Oh , wow ! ; Yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close .
Bro012_955	It 's applied the ; um on , ; yeah , ; something like this ,
Bed017_534	On the other hand , uh , FrameNet could well be useful . ; So do you know the FrameNet story ? ; Um , yeah . ; Uh , not not too much ,
Bro007_83	OK . ; But yeah . ; Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system . ; OK .
Bmr005_356	You were just talking about acoustic events . ; I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , ; Someone starts , someone stops ; Yeah .
Bro005_1179	So doing both is is not is not right , you mean , ; or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_34	OK . ; Uh , in and kind of go around see what people have been doing talk about that , a r progress report . Um , Essentially . ; Um And then uh Another topic I had was that uh uh Uh Dave here had uh said uh " Give me something to do . " ; And I I have I have uh failed so far in doing that .
Bmr031_479	I mean that 's wha ; because it 's it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . ; That 's like three times three times as much disk space . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2109	Hmm . ; So , um ; That 's good . ; I 'm wondering ,
Bro003_1408	I don't know what . ; I ask e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that , ; and h they he say me that h he does doesn't any any s any form to to do that . ; And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format ,
Bed003_1209	So a more general thing than " discussed admission fee " um , could be ; I I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be ; I don't know , ; if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way
Bed015_1291	I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . ; Right . ; But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them . ; OK .
Bed010_952	I 'm sure . " ; Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year , ; No , first year coming . ; or
Bro022_854	Mmm . ; Uh , ; and ; Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information ,
Bmr019_884	So so if we e e even just had a a It sounds like w we we almost do . ; So . ; Uh , if we We have two . ; We have two .
Bmr007_840	And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the the , uh one of the phone classes is silence . ; And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends . ; And then he has a second pass which is a modeling a Gaussian mixture model . ; Um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places .
Bed011_935	Yeah . ; OK , that would be great ; and if th if they use prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses or whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_192	OK , and so this , oh that ; The other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated ; but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? ; Yeah , that 's a good question .
Bmr011_689	So it 's just ; Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . ; Right , that 's true . ; Yeah , so it 's , uh , people people getting shy about it .
Bmr015_581	And then we 'll we 'll need to specify that somewhere . ; So I was just gonna do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bsr001_1294	Uh - huh . ; but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . ; So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things . ; Oh , I see .
Bro005_1197	I mean they they were not not using the neural net . ; Uh I don't know . ; OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single ; Yeah .
Bed013_619	Look at the web page and let 's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon ? ; More cues for us to find it are like , neural cons ; Johno will send you a link . ; Oh , you have a link . OK . OK .
Bro004_762	uh well , um . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is ; you 're ignoring
Bmr026_244	Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . ; So ; Just three different ; It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's
Bro014_185	Except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Uh , so it goes to two .
Btr001_137	that they 're they were unpopular . ; I liked them , ; Huh . ; and Adam liked them .
Bmr019_354	Um , but , you know , I uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem , ; I mean . ; So , ; you want to you want to That 's the obvious thing to try .
Bmr011_523	Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask " um , are you recording video ? " ; Um , right ? ; Right , ; And and the acoustic people will always say , " well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? "
Bro026_322	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro017_1292	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That is p that is that is possible . ; That 's why Intel of course is distributing it ,
Bmr009_621	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's interesting , I think , to consider the the window of normalization , ; normalization window . ; Eh because eh if we have a type of , a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible eh to normali
Bmr005_1212	That 's That would be a good match . ; Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . ; Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up ; and we don't have any say about it
Buw001_741	Yeah . ; cuz you 'll ; Well , the wireless . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_719	Most of those are done by a person . ; Yeah , ; I know I know that . ; I
Bro004_1203	so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way ; and then it 'd be OK . ; Ah . ; They they clearly did actually remove silent sections
Bro003_317	Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . ; Mmm . ; So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand , ; we 've got something much better than mel cepstra .
Bed011_965	Wizard of Oz . ; OK . ; Same ; OK , that .
Bro027_901	Um . ; Yeah . ; I wanted to do something very similar to the proposal as a first first try . ; Yeah .
Bro010_245	Um , we had a silence detector , ; so ; we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1139	So define the the input into the Bayes - net based on what the utterance , " where is X " , gives us . ; So definitely have an Entity node here which is activated via the ontology , ; s ; so " where is X " produces something that is s stands for X , whether it 's castle , bank , restroom , toilet , whatever .
Bro013_441	Uh - huh . ; And , well , is more or less robust . ; Is good for clean speech . ; Is quite good for noisy speech .
Bsr001_1179	I know , ; but we can blend it for the public . ; Uh . ; and that 's sorta how I got involved .
Btr002_947	Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep . Yep , yep , yep . ; and then end up collapsing the timebins .
Bsr001_787	it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it , ; and so it 's We we haven't thought it through . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed012_514	Somebody needs to zap that . ; You know ? ; Or know There needs to be some knowledge that ; We Yeah , but , the Bayes - net that would merge
Bro017_185	instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model . ; Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise . ; And I thought " well , that makes sense , " but so far we can't get much much out of it . ; Hmm .
Bmr031_842	The ; Rustle , rustle . ; the date on this one is July twenty - sixth , ; so , uh , I have to update it .
Bro026_435	But I I w w ; My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . ; And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , " OK , this much effect " I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . ; You want to change them one at a time .
Bed017_631	Yeah . ; I don't know why he @ @ ; Well , he had other things to do . ; oh , I , who knows ?
Bmr016_632	That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? ; Chuck on the lapel , ; so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times . ; Mmm .
Bro015_191	Wh - who 's they they ? ; Uh , I don't know who did it ; do you know , Stephane ? ; Who did that ?
Bed012_25	Or is it on fire or something happening to it ? ; Or is it stable ? ; and so forth , ; going all the way um , f through Parking , Location , Hotel , Car , Restroom , @ @ Riots , Fairs , Strikes , or Disasters .
Bmr024_1536	OK . ; So , is there something quick about Absinthe that you ? ; With this said . ; Uh . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe ,
Bmr005_837	Thanks . ; Another thing we discussed was um that ; So . ; It looks good .
Bmr019_1753	No ? ; Yeah , it 's a very short time . ; But , uh ; Yeah .
Bed006_100	yeah . ; Officially , ; but in reality already um much much longer ; and um um next to some some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she 's also the wizard in the data collection
Bmr027_909	but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? ; Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready . ; In th ; I don't know .
Btr002_1601	Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings ? ; Things that you ; I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time . ; When people get really loopy ,
Bmr024_1113	Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him " can I use your tape robot ? " , ; It we already have it there and it it 's ; he will say , " well that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . " ; No , we won't .
Bmr018_899	yeah . ; Right . ; And we 'll just have to see how hard that is . ; Yeah ,
Bro021_412	Yeah , yeah . ; Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter . ; So ; It 's something that 's also short enough in in latency .
Bmr031_1458	So . And then there 's jokes . ; And ; Yeah . ; Yeah , right .
Bro023_1075	On - line normalization and LDA ? ; but ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1333	Hmm . ; You end up with a similar difference ; Y y y yeah . ; We end up with
Bro027_1207	Uh . ; Then it 's something to do . ; Maybe . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_220	in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? ; I mean , that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro014_1383	and it 's not not enough to to have this kind of neat things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro010_1232	but . Well . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The oth the other thing , uh , that Dave was talking about earlier was , uh , uh , multiple mike things ,
Bmr007_687	Yeah . ; That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ? ; They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues ; and it 's quite interesting .
Bdb001_47	I mean , we I sort of already have developed an XML format for this sort of stuff . ; um , ; which ; Can I see it ?
Bmr015_1004	that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , ; be able that ; in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , ; so maybe
Bed009_755	but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers . ; But the people at D F ; Yeah . ; People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers .
Btr002_87	Right . ; Hmm . ; It 's interesting . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_1452	But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . ; And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio . ; Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_333	And so they 're ; I think they 're probably going over and over f sections . ; And then they get confused about whether they 've already put that beep , ; or if they heard , you know , three beeps in a row , was that three or two ,
Bmr030_836	Yeah ? They are ? ; They 're in the Yeah , if you do a P - make ; Oop . ; What are they called ?
Bro019_957	Uh w working in the cepstral domain ? ; So there is one guy in Grenada , ; Yeah , in Grenada ; and another in uh , Lucent that I met at ICASSP .
Bmr011_1417	I think there 's a second pass ; and I don't really know what would exist in it . ; But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_526	So it 's eighty - nine point point one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; and we have only forty forty feature
Bro012_531	yeah , I computed the um like , the confidence level on the different test sets . ; And for the well - matched they are around um point six uh percent . ; For the mismatched they are around like let 's say one point five percent . ; And for the well - m uh HM they are also around one point five .
Bdb001_575	Now now how would you how would you represent , um , multiple speakers in this framework ? ; Huge . ; Were You would just represent them as ; Um ,
Bns001_132	Yeah . ; But , Give me a sign and send me an abstract so that I can announce it , then , for the next meeting . ; Yeah . ; That 's OK .
Bro021_1096	uh ; pfff ! ; I can put log of EX plus log ; Oh .
Bmr016_1088	OK . ; Well X question mark , ; anything starting with X is scratch . ; OK .
Bmr002_688	Mm - hmm . ; Right , but we can do automated alignment . ; That 's not a problem ; OK
Bmr014_397	but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , ; if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis ; Misspelled . ; Yeah .
Bed010_381	How exp ; I don't think it 's ; Is it free ? ; Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I it seems to
Bmr013_435	But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , ; um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not . ; You wouldn't necessarily have to . ; Um , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week ,
Bed011_218	you know And each person is only gonna do it once , ; so you don't have to worry about them being bored , ; so if if it 's one service , one luxury item , you know , one big - ish place , and so forth and so on , um then my guess is that that the data is going to be easier to handle . ; Now of course you have this I guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff ,
Bed003_1617	Yeah . ; Sorry , ; Wednesday , ; yeah .
Btr001_1078	Mm - hmm . ; It must be really rare though , ; I haven't run across that often . ; Ha - ha h Is it rare ?
Bro018_538	Yeah . ; I 'm adding complexity . ; Yeah . ; Just
Bsr001_1709	Right . ; Right . ; Cool . ; Hmm .
Bmr028_838	Mm - hmm . ; And ; So , the reference file for the relative times at which ; Oh , yeah . That 's really hard .
Bmr003_2093	Right . ; Well , we wanna do that definitely . ; Right . ; Right .
Bdb001_135	and , ; Oh , well . ; um ; I I guess my question is more , uh , what d what do you do with , say , a forced alignment ?
Bro024_696	Yeah . ; It has some music also . ; I mean , very horrible music like like ; I know .
Bed015_1947	Right . ; Yeah . ; Exactly . ; Right .
Bmr006_538	Oh . ; Ah ! ; So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . ; So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space .
Bmr023_928	but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency , ; Hmm . ; like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . ; We had something more fancy .
Btr001_2259	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , ; " I c I could get all those extra signatures ,
Bro016_275	Uh , would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well - matched case ? ; So , if we computed what the range was in well - matched , and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it have the same range as ? ; No . You don't wanna change it for different conditions . ; No .
Bed002_875	Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? ; Like , w ; what you 're doing now ? ; or
Bns002_176	And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network . ; Thank you , Joe . ; Yeah , ; I see .
Bmr010_841	Against they could do forced alignment . ; because ; Yeah . ; actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know , is pretty good .
Btr001_414	I don't know . ; Oh , like the region ? ; I have no idea about Spain , ; Yeah .
Btr001_1346	A couple were . ; Really ? ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bmr014_1019	That is true . ; Um . Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them , ; I don't know ; I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented ,
Bmr006_1830	OK . ; Yeah , we should just market it to non - English speaking countries . ; Uh , maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . ; OK .
Bmr031_260	because you have those people who re - occur over and over . ; Yeah . ; I mean , the anchor speakers tend typically . ; Right .
Bed002_985	" Take a picture of it " ; Mm - hmm . ; you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_407	And then he should go on and do the other stuff bec ; Yeah . ; but But this will ; Yeah , no . I didn't mean that that for you to do that ,
Bro027_691	But I think you have ; I mean , you have twenty for delta computation ; which y now you 're sort of doing twice , ; right ?
Bmr019_1985	OK . ; Mmm ! ; And Andreas has the last word . ; Did you read it twice or what ?
Bed009_1135	OK . ; Is it i in , ; then , your place , in five five - A ? ; Alright .
Bed015_535	but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is . ; So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be ; like the question is for example , what does " Watergate " refer to there ? ; Does it , you know does it refer to , um
Bmr020_144	I 'll help , ; but obviously I can't , really do , most of it , ; Yeah . ; I think several people sent this ,
Bed010_207	Yeah . ; But but we we 're swit ; and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . ; Right .
Bro023_650	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then you multiply your noisy power spectrum with this . ; You get an estimate of the clean power spectrum .
Bro010_1132	Um , ; so , uh , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? ; Ri ; Yeah ,
Bed005_1113	Uh , you can Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess . ; OK , so you should take a look . ; OK ; Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life .
Bmr005_1428	No , definitely . ; and ; i you know , people who are ; Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d
Bed006_872	I I may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that I 've always viewed things ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; and that that may or may not be what you guys intended .
Bmr027_419	And there are two different ways . ; I mean , and either way works ; probably , I mean . ; Except I really think in this case
Bro013_499	but it but it g ; Yeah . ; with noise of course ; but but
Bed015_1663	And so , yeah , I mean ; Yeah . ; So that that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah . ; Right .
Bmr021_1004	Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off . ; Right . ; Because it doesn't spit out zeros , ; it spits out epsilons .
Bed015_1121	you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for ; Yeah . ; um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . ; So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , " oh , some " you know , " it 's a guy
Bmr030_602	I guess they haven't got a p ; Actually there are a few I saw a web - based one at one point . ; Web - based ? ; Where you could send them audio files over the web
Bmr007_602	But . ; Um . ; You know , the other thing I was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data . ; Ach .
Bro004_612	Yeah . Yeah . ; OK ; so these are not ; OK ,
Bed015_2123	You get the result , ; and you throw it away . ; And the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . ; You may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes .
Bmr024_245	Uh - huh . ; And and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , for the for the , um , the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . ; So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is . ; Package of twenty hours right now , and then once that 's done , move on to the next .
Btr001_385	because i I just couldn't deal with it , ; Yeah . ; and ; Yeah , I had the same experience .
Bed015_443	Yeah , that 's true . ; Yes . ; I like I I like spending fourth of July in other countries , whenever I can . ; Right .
Bro015_67	Probably the um these weight things , they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for TI - digits than for the SpeechDat - Car . ; So it would be weighting of ; um ; It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now .
Bmr021_344	Mmm . ; And I think the type , y you say um I think dash T ; and then there are different different encoding methods , ; but if you wanna use the shorten one , you say d " minus T shorten " ,
Bro027_949	Mm - hmm . ; So I wonder , ; um , ; Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ?
Bsr001_1755	We were thinking something like , you know , ten hours to begin with . ; They were gonna ; There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e ; Mmm .
Bmr020_275	There are differences in how you measure it , ; but still it 's You know , the difference between um between that number and what we have in meetings , ; which is more like , you know , close to in meetings like these , uh you know , close to twenty percent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_173	I I also have it running here , ; Oh , I see . ; Uh - huh . ; so if I do this now , um , you can see that it parsed the wonderful English sentence , " Which films are on the cinema today evening ? "
Bmr005_537	Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ? ; Right . ; Right . ; right ?
Bro028_940	and then Barry can say something about what what we 're talking about . ; OK . ; So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week . ; He 'll be here for about six months .
Bed004_459	And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . ; So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing ; OK . ; given that we 're not gonna screw with the technology and just always use uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of how do we do that .
Bns002_1149	well , the same way ; Yeah , but the ; as we are asking , for example , when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life , we can go and say " well , we will we are happy with this UPS ground system . ; What we want w is two - day delivery service , or w twenty - four hours service , and we are willing to pay more or less for this service .
Bmr009_1412	And we 'll see what we get . ; We 're all sufficiently tired of this that we 're agreeing with you . ; Be easier on the subjects . ; I think that 's fine .
Bmr013_184	Pre - prehistory . ; yeah . ; And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do . ; Right .
Bmr018_966	So so all they So that all they would have to do is put like an " X " there . ; Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod ; So blank for blank for silence , " S " ; " S " for speech , " X "
Bro013_376	I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk ; but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_416	eh But ; I see there your point . ; OK . ; That 's right .
Bmr029_709	I think , che check with Dave . ; Oh , OK . I 'll ask David , then . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_482	Mm - hmm . ; So the the for the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region . ; Yeah . ; And that 's it .
Bed017_94	Hi . Hi . ; Hi . Hi . ; And , um , ; So when you said " Andreas " I thought you were talking about Stolcke .
Bmr011_79	What about , uh , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? ; Yeah , we 're working more on it ; but , it 's not finished . ; OK .
Bed005_958	so that just we know what the d agenda is ? ; Um , the Wu paper , ; I think maybe ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr016_1423	That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , ; OK . ; but I have found " EH " in native speakers too . ; But it 's mostly non - native
Bro025_423	So , @ @ I mean , you were doing a lot of changes . ; Did you happen to notice how much , uh , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ? ; What about this ? ; Uh , y you had something on it .
Bmr019_1038	But there are fewer I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , just from We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment .
Bed012_726	Ah . ; But we 're all going to be here on Tuesday again ? ; Looks like it ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1534	uh , aware of what 's going on . ; But but just ; Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , ; Yep .
Bed014_742	I think it 's also something that people have not done before , is um , sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of , uh , inferences , on ; whether anything relevant to the current something has been uh , has crept up in the dialogue history already , or not . ; And , um ; I have the , uh If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there .
Bmr018_1038	I agree . ; Yeah . ; I agree . ; We were always gonna run them past somebody .
Bmr011_971	Yeah . ; Cuz ; OK . ; But but the , uh I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people ,
Bmr012_537	and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . ; So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all . ; I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1292	Right . ; Yeah . ; So I think that we 'll need to adjust some ; And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through .
Btr001_1440	So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr011_139	And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , yeah .
Bmr025_188	Right . ; Yeah that sounds good . ; And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally ; That sounds really neat .
Bmr031_1448	And we had different levels . ; Now we have things like " amuse " . ; Like , " oh , you finally got it " . ; And um , and " disappointed - tired " . Like , " yeah , no , that 's wrong again " .
Bmr014_497	Oh yes . ; Okay , good . ; Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . ; I spent um
Bro027_1203	Clean training , yeah . ; on a clean training , or zero DB testing . ; Yeah , we 'll so we 'll see . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_275	but you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh who who speaks a lot , then effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process . ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed004_499	And a very simple thing . ; We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this these uh this changed now only um , um
Bro005_348	Mm - hmm . ; Not matching condition , ; Yeah . ; but uh , the uh , Italian training .
Bmr018_1200	Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough , or ; Maybe the yeah , the s thing that you have tightened @ @ , ; Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down . ; oh .
Bmr010_1252	But I think , do you , maybe , ; eh ? ; Did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see ? ; Or what was that ?
Bro023_751	And ; So . ; So that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ? ; Yeah ,
Bro003_916	And , that includes , um , the English Spa - um , Italian . Finnish . ; Finnish . ; Uh , we ' r we 're gonna get German , ; right ?
Bmr003_2377	Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ? ; Uh , that 's an ethernet connection . ; Well ; Yeah no no I 'm a I I I ain't joking here .
Bmr008_749	Well , I you know , I w I was thinking of it as e ; that 's a good point , ; but I was thinking uh , you know , with reference to the language model issue , which uh ; and I guess it could be done inductively ,
Bed008_551	end point ? ; i endpoint , e end poi ; this is sa ; Ah .
Bed008_631	oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? ; Yea - n is that ; Like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ? ; yeah
Bed014_1180	Mm - hmm . ; Surprise . ; So , um . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_556	Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . ; Hmm . ; And , th ; So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually .
Bmr016_1213	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , I guess So , from the point of view of ; That 's a good point .
Bro017_687	Yeah . ; uh ; but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants . ; You know actually , I don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad .
Bro028_509	Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it ; and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it . ; So I 'm waiting to hear from him . ; But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is .
Bmr014_170	Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . ; Right . ; Oh , we should do it . ; OK .
Btr002_1647	And so I 'm just ; Yeah . And I 'm sitting there bored ; cuz I r I really have no concept of what they 're talking about . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_297	Ah . ; Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point . ; Oh . ; Yeah , depends on which one you mean .
Bro003_1265	Yeah , I mean , ; I kind of like this because what it ; No ; uh , no , what I like about it is
Bro021_1131	Mm - hmm . ; the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech . ; This only that . ; But the idea is that
Bro023_1499	Yeah , ; but in this experiment I did I didn't use any VAD . ; I just used the twenty first frame to estimate the noise . ; And So I expected it to be a little bit better , if , uh , I use more more frames .
Bns002_500	OK ? ; And delayed . ; And so there 's no advantage to uh if it 's aborted , by by any data packets . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1170	Nah . ; because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ? ; I mean ; Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one .
Bmr010_1080	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I I I think this year we we actually , uh , can do it . ; Oh , wonderful .
Bro003_414	I guess Finnish is a is is a little bit like Hungarian , supposedly , ; right ? ; Or is ; I think
Bed011_949	Uh But , Eh - uh this is actually a conversation you and I have to have about your thesis fantasies , and how all this fits into that . ; Got it . ; Yeah . ; Uh Yeah . OK .
Bro017_689	but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants . ; You know actually , I don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad . ; I mean you you compute the features once , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_804	Right . ; Oh , good point ! ; I mean , we 've we 've got we 've got a lot of data . ; Ah !
Bmr011_992	No , just ; Uh - huh . ; you know , like we just did , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_838	That one that you have ? ; Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro010_224	and was tending to handle convolutional noise . ; We did we actually did nothing about additive noise . ; So , um , ; the , uh , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job .
Btr002_3365	but anything that doesn't , I just go through this list , and I I k tag it right then . ; And so , in one in one in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred instances of this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_444	Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole that 's fine . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; You know , if you say we 're we 're dump dump dump .
Bed005_490	" And where is it playing ? " There should also be a reference to something , maybe . ; Our d This is re um ; Mmm . ; Here , we change and so , we Here we add something to the Discourse - Status , that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before
Bmr015_314	u ; Tomorrow . ; is that ; Tomorrow .
Bed010_464	Yeah . ; Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff . ; OK . ; So but this is the long run .
Bsr001_409	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application . ; Huh .
Bmr030_847	uh ; A what ? ; A r ; P - make stuff .
Btr002_2539	So , if it 's meant as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it , with the HMPH thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; I usually tend to think that it 's a more of a ; Hhh . not indignation .
Bmr005_1402	That was hilarious . ; if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it . ; Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . ; So then that would double what we had .
Bmr018_1089	That I don't wanna do that , ; Yeah , I 'm doing that for AVIOS . ; but . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_396	It couldn't be twelve . ; Cuz no , we 've only no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that ; We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1483	Isn't that wonderful ! ; Yeah . ; Excellent ! ; Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels .
Bed014_329	Uh . But ; one of the things I w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds ; and ; uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences .
Bmr019_1818	Well ? ; You This is our reward if we do our digi ; Yeah . ; or what ?
Bmr006_1294	It 's spread out . ; Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1278	If ; yeah that 's right . ; Yeah . ; Uh , well , we started late .
Btr002_2053	Absolutely . And sometimes these are meetings I participated in . ; It 's - it 's like ; Mm - hmm . ; So you 've this is like the tenth time for you , then .
Bmr018_870	and finish the sentence ; and and sometimes it looks coherent and and the ; I mean it 's it 's not a simple problem . ; But it 's really
Bro008_242	I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . ; But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do ; Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , " Here 's a number of things that could be done . " ; So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did ,
Bmr008_1382	you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which makes sense ,
Bmr008_1259	Yeah . ; But Even if we can't , generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your database blank , that this information was not collected for this meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there 's just not gonna be a way around that .
Bmr030_104	I guess we might hear something , ; Yeah , so I guess we ge we had better be on call for a little while . ; but ; Yeah , exactly .
Bed009_564	It oughta be called a a dialogue manager . ; cuz that 's what everybody else calls it . ; I would think , ; yeah .
Bmr026_700	Uh . Um . ; Yeah ; and ; I think it must be uh nearing the end of the week .
Bed008_164	Doesn't matter . ; doesn't matter . ; Agree there ; but here um I wasn't sure what to write in .
Bmr020_346	We also fixed the transcripts in in numerous ways . ; Uh , but mostly we added one one number , which was ; what if you uh , basically score ignoring all ; So so the the conjecture from the HLT results was that most of the added recognition error is from insertions due to background speech .
Btr002_2334	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's really cool .
Btr001_1247	Punctuation after brackets . ; Yeah , ; that 's right too . ; Yep .
Bmr009_350	Cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like ; I don't think this is true , but what if ; To study individual ? ; Hmm ?
Bro021_1019	Yeah . ; Uh . ; I don't see how you get the second expression from the top one . ; The I mean , just more generally here , if you say " log of , um , A plus B " ,
Bro010_478	but but , uh , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain ; Yeah . ; and ; Mmm .
Bed002_22	but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . To try to read them while everyone else is . ; Everyone would need extreme focus . ; So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . ; Other way .
Bro028_966	And the idea is these are used to sample , um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . ; So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . ; And , um , that , um , is is interesting , ; cuz , @ @ for for one thing , you could use it , um , in a a multi - scale way .
Buw001_2137	I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . ; Who specifically ask not to be . ; Like Jane , for example . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_417	and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? ; So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? ; And you probably need intermediate nodes . ; I we don't know what they are yet .
Bro016_282	I was just saying that when we pick a range , we we wanna pick a range that we map our numbers into ; we should probably pick it based on the range that we get in the well - matched case . ; Yeah . ; Otherwise , I mean , what range are we gonna choose
Bmr005_460	I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . ; Silent . ; Silence starting or silence ending ; Yeah , silent , ground
Bsr001_2595	That 's right . ; yeah . ; Wow , ; but the c but the recorder just crashed .
Bro023_1216	Yeah , ; I was thinking if you had a clean version of the signal and and a noisy version , and your targets were the M F - uh , you know , whatever , frequency bins ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr021_66	Um , they 're more directional , ; a little better error uh , noise cancellation , ; and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth , like this , ; OK .
Buw001_2036	Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , ; because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_590	OK . ; Yeah . ; Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions ; I guess you ha haven't had a chance to work with it too much
Bmr021_968	So . ; You can really tell from the prosody where it goes . ; s meeting . ; I actually have one more thing that
Bro026_100	Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS ; and I 'm just wondering Uh , I mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_347	Yeah . ; I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily or , you know , something like that , it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1263	so how do we do this , is the only thing . ; Or just have them talk amongst themselves . ; Have them have their own meeting . ; Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,
Bmr014_488	Yeah . ; Right . ; And uh , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running ; and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet
Bmr019_1734	because , eh , I haven't good results , eh , yet ; but , eh , I I pretend to to continuing out to Spain , eh , during the the following months , ; eh , because I have , eh , another ideas ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_603	Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous . ; I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle , ; Mmm . Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_1005	It 's eight . ; does it have do with the sampling rate ? ; I have no idea . ; But each each fiber channel has eight eight channels
Buw001_1551	I don't know . ; That 's something I always forget . ; Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , ; Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you .
Bed014_1207	So , um . ; And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , ; the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to uh , indefinite pronouns ; like " someone fixed the car "
Bmr016_1104	and and I can tell you first , uh , to go through the steps ; although you 've probably seen them . ; Um , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , um , r really c a fair number of words , and uh , @ @ natural speech ; which means s self - repairs and all these other factors , that there 're lots of things to be , um , s standardized and streamlined and checked on .
Bed016_1037	But that 's not metaphorical . ; Hmm . ; It 's another ; Yeah .
Bmr013_327	Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . ; So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has uh uh , comes from articulatory gestures to that . ; And someone else , might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing .
Bro027_208	They seem to be ; Well , the semester actually is starting up . ; Is it already ? ; Yeah ,
Bed005_534	and , again , as we thought it 's really simple . ; This is sort of the , uh , um , parameters . ; We have @ @ simple " from objects " and " to objects " and so forth , ; points of interest along the way
Bmr024_1424	Right . ; So , it 's not ; I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1363	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mmm . ; So that 's I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it .
Bro014_1059	And then you just , uh , compute differences ; Yeah . ; I have here one example if you if you want see something like that . ; and ,
Bmr031_1212	So . ; Um , fishing went pretty well . ; Oh , yeah . All of us are banging . ; Good . Good .
Bed002_791	So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . ; So that 's part one . ; Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , ; and it understands you completely .
Bro023_686	I see , ; I see . ; I mean , in the long run you 're doing the same thing ; but y but there you make different approximations ,
Bed002_766	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1230	I mean , so if someone wants to use that data ; OK . ; We 're running a little short here . ; We , uh , uh , cou trying to
Bed013_97	But maybe one could do some learning . ; If you get the system to speak to itself , you may find n break downs and errors and you may be able to learn . ; And make it more robust , ; maybe learn new things .
Bed011_673	do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's different . ; That 's that 's sort of part of th that 's not a destination reason , that 's sort of " en passant , " right .
Btr001_878	Hmm . Would you want , um , uh , a transcription of something like that , ; of a big pause in between in the middle of a word ? ; Or just leave it as , " fascinating " ? ; What I 've done I 've
Bed016_428	Is it ? ; So it ; It 's on biocomputation . Would ; Yeah , it 's different ,
Bro017_1258	Ye - Yeah . ; I mean , I remember when we were trying to put together all the ICSI software for the submission . ; Or ; That 's what he was saying ,
Bmr023_318	which was the s the set that I 've been , uh OK , talking about up to this point , ; but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . ; Right now they 're in the process of being edited . ; Um , the , um
Buw001_191	OK . ; Right . ; So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors . ; Good .
Bro019_545	Sorry , ; yeah , I 'm not being I 'm not being clear . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_67	This this is not It 's not bad for the project if Keith is talking to George . ; OK . So my suggestion is we just ; Forge ahead . ; Forge ahead , yeah .
Bmr028_1562	Mm - hmm . ; So , ; I guess if I don't ever think of it as negative . More like , it 's something we 're not building . ; It 's not pejorative at all .
Bmr027_119	Right . I mean , that 's fine . ; OK , good . ; I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply . ; That makes it easy .
Bmr027_1099	Um , and the final one , ; the transcriber had th " in the core network itself ; or the exit unknown , ; not the internet unknown " .
Bro027_1798	If it 's the case , then multiplying it again by i by something ? ; So ; It may not be it ; Yeah .
Bro003_319	So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand , ; we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . ; It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . " ; OK ? And so we give them these gobbledy - gook features
Bmr027_543	Do we have to have it notarized ? ; I i i em email is enough . ; I mean ; OK .
Bmr029_73	Right . ; Um ; We have a whole parallel set of things over here which are all with digits . ; Mmm .
Bmr001_409	Right . ; So , six gigabytes . ; But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels . ; Forty - eight kilohertz , yeah .
Bmr009_501	If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then then ; yeah . ; And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here . ; Um and that that 's the indicator that we 're getting .
Bed015_1084	So . ; Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there ; Yeah . ; but actually that 's a property of the situation .
Bed016_1036	Yeah . ; But that 's not metaphorical . ; Hmm . ; It 's another
Bmr019_445	And there 's a screw that you can tighten . ; And then it ; Right . ; Right .
Buw001_1761	That 's different than format . ; That 's ; Well , um ; W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work
Bns001_1751	since to use it ; Eh you guys do that discussion later on please , ; And and But ; yeah
Bmr022_359	Interesting . ; Well , cuz they 're s distinguishing between twenty - three ; that 's your indicator there , and twenty - three that somebody happens to say in a meeting . ; Oh , that 's true .
Bro028_1100	we have our we have our RASTA features and ; and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping , uh , from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bmr023_708	It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings ; because we did include meeting type as a feature , ; so ; whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts
Bmr026_1180	You know , it 's more like like thirty forty hours ; Alright . ; something like that . ; Wrong number .
Bmr013_448	I mean , I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_301	and um it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases ; and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched ; better . ; Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state .
Bro003_1253	and you don't ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So you could be
Bmr025_119	um , which I haven't used , haven't looked at . ; Dan says it 's pretty good ; Mm - hmm . ; but it does mean you need to be running a web server .
Bmr006_1323	Yeah . ; Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's ; Right . ; I mean , it 's not to say I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues .
Bed003_316	And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . ; Yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here . ; Yeah . ; So we haven't uh , managed
Bmr027_1068	especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones . ; Those sneak in . ; Um , the next one ; Discourse markers .
Bmr027_681	Disk space , ; oh my god ! ; By the way , has has Jeremy signed the form ? ; I hadn't thought about that .
Bmr014_971	Yeah . ; there 's a problem with it . ; So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen . ; I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing .
Btr001_400	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1495	So when you say " slow " , does that mean to ; No , the the one that 's installed is fine . ; It 's not slow at all . ; I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views .
Btr002_1373	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , um , ; yeah .
Bdb001_522	The ; Yep . ; and ; The other thing the other way that I sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the Transcriber format .
Bro003_342	and it sends features out . ; OK , ; so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is . ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_205	but Maybe not counting the non - native speech , ; cuz if That that just doesn't translate very well . ; Well , ; I would I would love to do some , um
Bed006_1379	Well in that case , we can't we can't w if if ; OK . ; l let 's let 's not ; well the thing is if that 's the case we our I don't think our system can handle that currently .
Bed008_1433	I mean that seems like that 'd be weird , ; Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . ; right ? ; Oh , OK .
Bro011_26	So y you guys had a a meeting with uh with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . ; Um ; Mmm . ; and uh somebody
Bed016_917	you know , you wonder how people here make their living , ; and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery ; Yeah . ; that doesn't mean , " I want to buy some baked goods . "
Bro008_271	And , um , then it would it would , uh be something to to discuss in the meeting . ; But , uh , not clear what will go on . ; Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . ; I mean , you can always have another standard after that ,
Bro027_549	Uh , p Wait a minute . ; It 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech , ; So . ; Forty cleaning .
Bmr029_576	Oh , we 'll call you when you get there . ; You 'll have email . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr024_758	Those aren't meetings . ; But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out . ; You know ? ; There 's a couple other questions that I have too ,
Bed015_1476	Yeah , but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , ; because " you " , " me " , " he " , " they " , ; you know , " these guys " , ; all these expressions , nuh , are in in much the same way contextually dependent as " here , " and " now , " and " there "
Bmr023_1178	Um , however , there 's times when it is not good . ; Uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .
Bmr026_37	No , no . ; No . ; no ? ; We 're not waiting on them .
Bmr024_1513	Right . ; So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models . ; Yeah , maybe not . ; But it it I st still see it as I mean , there 's there 's a history to this , too ,
Buw001_2100	intelligent - room sorts of things . ; Oh , really ? ; It 's those guys . ; I hadn't known that then they 'd done any more than that .
Bro019_1664	Digits . ; I almost forgot our daily digits . ; You wanna go ahead ? ; Sure .
Bro014_84	Mm - hmm . ; And so , ; um , I I ran a couple of experiments where I reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , I think , ; and I got almost the exact same results .
Buw001_1414	OK - OK . ; Yeah . ; In the interest of , um , ; Yeah .
Bro022_528	because this is also one big difference between the two systems . ; Um , ; the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more SRI system are more complex . ; But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this
Bro026_761	Mm - hmm . ; It 's like as painless as possible , ; is what Do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then Just , ; I see .
Bmr016_4	And we already got the crash out of the way . ; It did crash , so I feel much better , earlier . ; Yeah . ; Interesting .
Bmr023_1173	Yeah . Yeah . ; The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , ; uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . ; Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great .
Btr002_1377	One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything . ; Hmm . ; Because you end up p p p ; if you try to n go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge huge space of time
Bmr022_1320	Yeah . ; I mean it 's like there are different layers of whatever ; and different types of conventions , ; and if it were an acronym , then I would I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things ,
Bed005_548	Who are doing this . ; So this is not a complicated negotiation . ; No . ; There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ?
Bmr007_38	So , ; So we all forgot . ; Uh , ; From last time I wanted to Uh The An iss uh one topic from last time .
Bro019_1394	um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events , ; and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition . ; Um , ; and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events .
Bro028_171	We don't ? ; Well ! ; And ; so Well , things are not optimal
Buw001_73	Oh , yeah , the element , ; yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . ; Yeah . ; That 's good .
Bmr031_334	Right . ; Yeah . ; What 's the plan if were we still going to be like a center for transcribing data ? ; What happens if th they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources
Bro023_1571	y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive ; Mm - hmm . ; and Uh , ; well , they are mainly stationary .
Bmr019_194	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz our sense from the other from the Aurora , uh , task is that
Bmr003_352	That 's right . ; So it could be that it 's not actually wired backwards ; it 's just that ambiguous . ; I was wondering also , Get ready . whether the lights made any noise .
Bed014_1288	And he 'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing ; Right . ; but aren't where we 're at right now , ; Like like what you call certain things ,
Bro021_826	and how much of it is just due to the fact that you 're not accurately finding enough regions that that are really n noise ? ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_841	Yeah , then , what is the current status anyway ? ; Um , I 'm currently I 'm looking into Quality of Service Routing , ; this is . ; and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB .
Buw001_1031	because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . ; Running to ; Yeah , ; fff !
Bmr008_1097	Hmm . ; Just to pick up an arbitrary an example . ; So - and - so and so ; We this wouldn't be relevant all the time
Bro010_133	Um , ; so we will try also to add a nice downsampling ; having a filter that that ; Uh - huh .
Bmr021_136	OK . ; And so we had these wired for us . ; Oh . I see . OK . ; Well , it s It seems like right now if if u what they 're complaining are those ,
Bmr013_203	On some subset . ; One thought might be to do this uh , on on the digits , or some piece of the digits . ; Uh , it 'd be easier , uh , and so forth . ; The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i
Bmr030_427	because they tried it , ; and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps , ; Exactly . ; and go forward in the file , et cetera , et cetera .
Bed006_499	You will be here . ; There is a d ; Isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that ? ; Finals was that .
Bmr015_410	yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty . ; I mean when they Do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in Chuck 's , ; that he got last year ? ; I don't I don't know .
Bed013_982	blah - blah - blah ? ; I mean . ; the the idea is even more general . ; The idea is to say , we encounter a certain entity in a in a in a utterance .
Bmr028_1346	It just really means ; I it 's i ; It 's even more than that . ; I think it it really gives a very strong perspective , that you know that what you were doing is not an un - biased experiment .
Bmr027_531	So they s so so Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . ; Yep . ; And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something ; and they wouldn't actually hear from us ,
Bmr008_348	In in like the London - Lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact . ; Yeah . ; So they say , you know , uh middle thirties , you know fifties or sixties , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_120	and then uh meet again . ; Yeah . ; So it 's , you know , not a matter of a ; Yeah .
Bmr016_777	Cool . ; So at this point we can sort of finalize the naming , and so forth , ; Yep . ; and we 're gonna basically re rewrite out these waveforms that we did
Bro018_1007	but we did eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal . ; So that is an option in RASTA . ; Hmm . ; Uh and you can certainly play with that .
Bmr006_452	It 'd be fun . ; Yeah . ; I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . ; Right .
Btr002_2678	Sometimes it 's hard to tell . ; Like sometimes " Hhh ! " is a laugh . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro021_675	And then I ran the whole recognition experiment with Italian ; and I got , like , worse results than not using it . ; Then I ; So , I 've been trying to find where the problem came from .
Bed008_1455	Right , right . ; Which is slightly tricky . ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_685	that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . ; Mm - hmm . ; But are they changing the weighting ? ; Uh , no ,
Bmr012_939	OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_749	Absolutely . ; Yeah . ; I ; And so , you know , I 've I 've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing ,
Bed009_585	anyway . ; I if if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term . for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist . ; That 's external services . ; Yeah , but that 's not g eh tha
Bro004_1349	and ; Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be ; once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . ; I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there .
Bmr027_723	Oh , OK . ; There 's nothing left of the original signal . ; Cuz ; Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could
Bed015_242	So we want s " designates " to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects ; but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . ; So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , " are you of type is this part of type whatever " , um , the " designates " tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . ; OK , so if you have like " the big red ball " , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun .
Bdb001_821	Yep . ; And it 's still gonna be ; it 's still gonna be , uh , not direct . ; Hmm .
Bns002_1402	which is i which is proper ; so he will get the colored one . ; Michael ; Ah , thank you thank you very much .
Bro007_251	and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right , so between one and sixteen . ; See the I mean the reason I 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?
Bro018_1108	um where I just used the simulated impulse response um the error rate went from something like eighty it was from something like eighteen percent to um four percent . ; And on meeting rec recorder far mike digits , mike on channel F , it went from um forty - one percent error to eight percent error . ; On on the real data , not with artificial reverb ? ; Right .
Bed017_650	And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . ; So . ; So , uh , who is that again ? ; I u Dan Gildea , GILDEA .
Bed006_1434	Yes because nobod no the modules don't ; Yeah . ; uh ; This is this is a schema that defines XML messages that are passed from one module to another ,
Bmr002_227	Your intonation sounds like somewhat like sentence intonation . ; Well , you can intone it however you want . ; Imagine that you 're reading a number phone number to someone . ; OK .
Bed003_713	" How do I get to the bank ? " ; I see . ; Hmm . ; And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you
Bed015_316	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Right , right . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed015_1079	It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been , ; Yeah . ; or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . ; This
Bed003_1513	Yeah . ; I 've done that kind of thing . ; whatever , ; Boston .
Bmr018_833	you know , they 're time - aligned , ; so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word , ; Mm - hmm . ; if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out
Bed006_1628	probably . ; Promise ? ; We will r ; Yeah .
Btr002_2868	Uh - huh . I think this is really ; Not enough overlaps . ; yeah . ; And so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more .
Bmr028_545	Right . And you recommended using the one with two s maximum of two seconds ? ; Yeah . ; A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ? ; Yep .
Bsr001_1916	If they know that ; Yeah , if it 's very good , ; Yeah . ; that 's true .
Bmr002_638	Oh . So , these are p particularly for time alignment ? ; Well , these are uh tools ; So , MATE and EAGLES are both within the so - called uh Language Engineering branch , ; and um so they 're intended for this kind of a comp compu s computer science application type of approach .
Bmr008_447	OK . ; So . ; Um , and then the next are two sections ; One indented separately .
Bmr005_1210	Yeah , I was gonna mention that . ; Oh , that 's a good idea . ; That 's That would be a good match . ; Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .
Bed015_931	Yeah , I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of , ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know ; the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions .
Bmr012_1129	Yeah . ; Yeah , somehow . ; You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer . ; It 's not a bad idea .
Bro027_306	And they have these tables with , uh , various language model weights , insertion penalties . ; u ; OK , I haven't seen that one yet . ; Uh , it 's th it 's there on that web .
Bro018_557	and see if ; So what 's the advantage of support vector machines ? ; What ; Um . So , support vector machines are are good with dealing with a less amount of data
Bmr019_119	Right . ; Right . So in the digits , in most most cases , there weren't other people talking . ; So . ; Right .
Bmr005_1203	To be allowed to record them ? ; Yeah , people will get ; OK . ; It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .
Bro004_63	The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian . ; Um . We 've trained uh several neural networks on
Bro026_143	I mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . ; So then there 's something central ; and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_651	Yeah . So I 've I ; So tha that 's exactly what the P - file is for . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files .
Bro004_448	These numbers are uh ratio to baseline ? ; So , I mean wha what 's the ; So . ; This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for TI - digits ,
Bro013_495	The lower is noise and the height is clean . ; OK . ; So it 's harder to distinguish ; It 's height .
Bro012_124	OK . ; Yeah , look at a ; So it 's , ; yeah ,
Bmr003_1367	Good . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in .
Bmr002_775	Let me show y ; Have you seen this one , Dan ? ; No . ; And I 'll try to get one for you , too .
Bro017_1288	On Intel architecture maybe . ; Yeah , on Intel architecture , may not run in SUN . ; I 'm ; Yeah .
Bmr027_107	Right ? ; Yeah . As I said , we I just got one date ; Damn ! ; Yeah .
Bro019_726	Yeah . ; But this is natural recording . ; So remind me of what well - matched meant ? ; You 've told me many times .
Bsr001_672	Whatever . ; I mean , initially you may do a super - computer for the transcription , real time and then ; Right , I mean , ; so so one of our
Bed003_502	OK , I see your point . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns001_1265	So how to combine these pos uh potential um extensions in the um access networks , and ; without losing the end to end scope in the internet . ; Then you can have certain n novel features ; give the providers like KPN or whatever , the po the potential , in principle , to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks
Bmr010_1188	You start off with that and the statistical system ; then aligns things , ; and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad . ; Oh , excellent .
Bmr003_694	Mm - hmm . ; and ; And ; so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take .
Bro019_701	Uh - huh . ; Because , um , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like , ; or ; Mmm .
Bed009_919	What ? ; but What what 's happening on - line is just um um a a retrieval from the lexicon which would give all the stemming information ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr006_1097	Sorry . ; but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that ; and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . ; Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . The the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech .
Bed005_468	You bury the s the state in the function ; Alright . ; Uh ; Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ?
Bns002_1166	but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh , the new eleven megabytes per second version ; I 've been use it for for a while , ; and it w can tell you it works pretty well . ; and uh , the thing is that these devices have two different modes of operation .
Bro012_460	I should find that new one . ; I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever ; Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different ; but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall .
Bmr018_1073	Yep . ; If you ; And that we know , I mean , we have that . ; And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged .
Bmr006_519	So that was that topic , ; and then um , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question ; for ; We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings .
Bmr003_534	Well , I was even thinking that maybe we need to at least ping the U - dub to see ; We need we need to talk to them some more . ; you know , say " this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription " , if nothing else . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_103	Mm - hmm . ; No , I I wasn't complaining , ; I just wanted to understand . ; Yep .
Btr001_281	OK , ; well there 's one in particular who I find the hardest to transcribe of all , ; and it 's d she 's Spanish . ; Oh .
Bmr005_74	OK . ; Shall I shall I just start ? ; Yeah , just explain what it was . ; OK .
Bmr006_1424	and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that I mean , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . If you had three or four it 's Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Ooo ! ; That 's on my web pages .
Bro027_1430	Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . ; The a the argument i is kind of i in ; and it 's not like we really know , ; but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob
Bmr024_635	OK . ; OK . ; We weren't supposed to collect any data . ; So .
Btr002_2296	and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way . ; Um . ; Including , I mean , every little aspect . ; I and when I tell people what I do here ,
Bed003_690	Um . Yeah , ; well That 's that 's an interesting point . ; Whether you 're It 's whether It 's not ; And are th
Btr002_2630	Some people are transcribing it as a breath . ; I I used to , you know , back in the day back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh ; Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ? ; Yeah , that 's what I used to do too .
Bro016_181	I mean , it 's more directly like the the language scaling or the , uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling , ; That 's interesting . ; but you know that those things have kind of a similar effect to the insertion penalty ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_454	Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago ; Oh , it was . ; Oh , I shoul ; and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it .
Bmr003_2289	You wouldn't necessarily ; Well , ; you s understand what I 'm ; the the you can you can start start s sketching it out ,
Bmr008_591	It depends . ; I guess there 's a ; Right ? ; So , you could say " What region did you grow up in from these years ? "
Bmr016_397	You read the last line , I 'll read the first line . ; OK . ; Oh ! ; Wait oh it these are all the same forms .
Bed002_1167	Just a back door that I I think we should devote m ; Could happen . ; Yeah . So in terms of of the , um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . ; You don't You know , you don't really like it .
Bmr031_882	Huh ? ; There are five . ; There 're five ? ; Good .
Bro023_1685	OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh ; Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some
Bro023_997	Mm - hmm . ; and , ; mmm ; So what I did is , uh , some kind of nonlinear smoothing .
Bmr013_780	so ; and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . ; Great . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1201	It 's the pitch . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_860	Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . ; So and and ; let me see if I remember what they were . ; One of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , to uh , from bark scale to mel scale ,
Bro010_574	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; but , ; you know , it 's that that that 's tricky to do .
Bmr010_1106	But Some of them are . ; Yeah . ; Wow . ; Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks .
Bed011_580	So the next tour will be tomorrow ? ; It ; Right . ; For this .
Bed002_838	Oh , two - D . ; OK . ; Two - D . ; So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the for themselves
Bmr024_1370	But , still it 's a question ; if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something , ; Well , yeah . ; or ?
Bmr002_1224	assuming that we actually pursue it , ; but um we 've got a huge problem , ; because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data . ; Oh , good point .
Bed015_2026	Yeah . ; can we make it more elegant ? " ; Yeah , that 's ; Yeah .
Bed009_668	But but what it nee ; but th what the point is the ; in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven . ; So the dialogue manager may think it 's in a dialogue state of one sort ,
Bmr023_768	I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually . ; Oh . ; Deletions ? ; So , you , uh So , actually it it preferred to have a positive er , negative insertion penalty ,
Bed010_193	It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff . ; Yeah . ; And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints . ; Right , OK .
Bmr029_655	Right . Right . ; Because , if we wanna do what we just discussed ; So Uh , uh , the the best the easiest way to do that would be to just take You know , you make the channel be channel F , ; Yeah .
Bed016_250	Yeah . ; That 's done . ; Mmm . ; You have to change those strategies ,
Bro007_23	Sure . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_395	uh , ; in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic . ; And so , uh , if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be , then you you can do it there . ; You can also
Bmr024_142	Yeah . ; And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely . ; Yeah , one interesting note is uh , or problem ; I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , uh , SND - play and then the file ,
Bro023_579	um , ; t ; which is the overall improvement . ; But in some cases it doesn't improve at all .
Bro013_685	and so you you 'd like it to be that um the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , ; but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames ; cuz you j ; But if you take , say , a two millisecond um window
Bmr016_2292	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_535	yeah . ; I mean , this thing wearing sideway that that can ? ; Uh the ; It 's wired .
Buw001_2074	And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , ; Mm - hmm . ; but newly collected data would would be natural meetings . ; Actually , th @ @ the CMU folk have collected a lot of data .
Bmr003_1182	you 'd say ten ? ; Let 's say ten . ; Yeah , give them a break . ; The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ?
Bro004_286	Um . The English data No , the multilingual databases are two times the broad English data . ; We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge . ; So . ; So it 's two times ,
Bro008_134	I 'm I 'm , uh ; So , basically , the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence . ; Yeah . ; But it 's very close to to cepstral mean subtraction .
Bmr005_1116	Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , ; and then it 's getting the sum . ; So um , uh anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try ; somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .
Bmr003_1802	So thirty to one 's what you got ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's a new upper limit ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_370	uh , uh , ; I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . ; Yeah u I don't disagree with it ; the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something ,
Bmr031_1651	which is mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he he he actually does the real work on this , uh , reverberation thing . ; But I think it 's it 's it 's a real , uh it 's a real learning experience for both of us . ; And and , uh , I think it 's it 's a problem ar problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much , as we know . ; So , uh , w h he kind of did he started off with what was in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do ,
Btr002_2413	i not in a standard way , ; Oh . Yeah , that 's a different person . ; it 's ; OK . OK . OK .
Bro013_340	Hmm . ; Huh . ; Um . So there is this point . ; Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it
Bmr029_180	Uh , David just ; Um , I 'm sorry . ; Don just , uh , created a new version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized , ; but with different segmentation .
Bro022_702	Right . ; Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ? ; Um . ; Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet .
Bro018_1008	So that is an option in RASTA . ; Hmm . ; Uh and you can certainly play with that . ; But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first .
Bmr011_177	Right now , we 've got , uh , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . ; So why don't we replace those ; OK , just two . ; Well , however many we can plug in .
Bro016_649	Yeah . ; Fairly quickly you can do male female f male female stuff . ; Yeah . ; But as far as ,
Bmr016_1045	Very quickly . ; and it didn't seem to be any problem . ; I agree . ; Huh .
Bed016_256	Yeah . ; That 's , ten words ? ; Well , i it , you know . ; Maybe twelve .
Bed006_1204	because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something . ; Um now you define uh another action , ; Forced action or forced motion . ; it 's it 's called um uh s S P G - one
Bmr027_605	Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . ; Yeah . ; So it 's unusual that that they , uh ; So my original impression was that that was sufficient ,
Bmr006_246	So . ; I have a uh , um , question . ; Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a ; They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're uh assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks .
Bmr028_1703	Yeah . You could still eh ; Yeah . There 's eh the s the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue . ; I mean , if that is too low , then you can be pretty sure that it 's , uh , empty . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_923	Those will figure less prominently in things anyway . ; Yep . ; Yeah . It might it might partly just be European summer vacation issues . ; Possibly . It 's been , like , four months ,
Bed009_654	You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something . ; And so y you would like it t also be able to uh formulate a query . ; Mm - hmm . ; And to run that back through uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around .
Bed016_770	right , ; and like , what is film , ; the state you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . ; It 's
Btr002_322	Right . ; And then especially if you 've got a pause following it , ; but you don't always y ; these things are correlated but they 're not perfect .
Bmr009_213	in No I I I haven't the result ; did did you have this sort of thing , for just the just the l r uh the the unnormalized log energy ? ; OK . Yeah . ; So she she 's right .
Bro005_1230	Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do ; If we find ; uh ; I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L
Bed006_1740	OK . ; I see what you mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; RAD 's a great term .
Bed004_223	th ; or ? ; Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student , ; she just graduated
Bed010_867	Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , ; right ? ; d Well , yeah , ; where it actually is is covers the whole range of things .
Bro010_299	and it took half a second to get back to you , ; Yeah . ; I mean , it would be f ; I mean , it might even be too abrupt .
Bmr029_607	Right . ; Um ; S So , um . ; I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff .
Bns001_154	Claudia ; Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site . ; So , p For example , if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever , about the work you did before , what you are planning to do here , that would be fine , ; OK .
Bmr019_802	Yeah . ; Ju ; No , not ; I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words ,
Bsr001_847	which is taking place right now , actually . ; Mmm . ; Right . ; You you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform .
Bed009_986	W in ten minutes ? ; Ah ; mmm . No . ; uh uh I think we 're expect
Bro028_1017	Um , if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it ; i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , uh , um , uh , auditory front - ends . ; So it 's very , very similar , ; uh , but it 's not exactly the same .
Bro025_135	Yeah . Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; There 's just one piece of software .
Bed005_578	um , what 's the syntax for that , ; how get getting to vista points and calculating those on the spot . ; And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . ; That 's all they do it these days .
Bmr030_556	And you have to record every channel separately . ; No , because we 're doing the beep files . ; The beep files . ; Well , you know , I I think David might have a bunch of o old P Cs ,
Btr002_1228	But " six " and " eight " ? ; " Eight " , um , I remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last " T " . ; Oh . ; And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected .
Bro024_381	Right . ; Um , ; so I should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frames ? ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1190	Uh , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . ; It 's just a matter of , you know , providing ; So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time ; bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment .
Bsr001_1273	Mmm . ; and so . ; Well , ; one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is ,
Bro024_675	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; So . ; I mean , it uh , like , i i
Bmr024_232	So that 's the IBM stuff . ; We 've got that sorted out . ; Um , how 're we doing on the on the rest of it ? ; We 're doing well .
Bro021_10	You want me to run it today ? ; Yeah . Why don't you run it today ? ; OK . ; OK .
Bro014_809	So basically we try to , uh , find good features that could be used for voicing detection , ; uh , but it 's still , uh on the , ; um ; Oh , well , I have the picture .
Bmr014_444	You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , ; Yeah . ; so man So many ways that error prone . ; Right .
Bro028_1040	but it 's also , uh ; Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction ; and they 've done it on the time direction . ; I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously
Bns001_941	I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet ; and on PS PPP over something ; and how it works like that , ; but on the wireless I 'm not sure .
Bmr006_59	But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . ; So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , ; um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time ; One offs ?
Bed003_542	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and um Uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers in there ; Hmm . Yeah .
Bmr028_312	I mean , we could check . ; I don't think they do . ; Um , there was actually a Java back - end that apparently is actually a little faster . ; It generates byte code .
Bro027_566	So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta ; at nine nine frames of ; And then ten milliseconds for ; Fi - There 's an LDA filter .
Bmr026_24	Which meetings is she transcribing ? ; Speaking ; Um well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . ; OK .
Bns002_276	well , some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions ; and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism . ; So ; we are um reserving a certain , and a specific uh , area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time .
Bro013_190	So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and here we 're getting three or four three ,
Bmr005_36	After I just printed out a zillion of them . ; Yeah , well , that 's ; Um , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion . ; Uh , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points
Bro004_990	I see . ; So there 's a question of whether you would ; Two e @ @ it 's one . ; Yeah .
Bro010_123	What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? ; Three hundred and thirty . ; So that would be within ? ; Yeah ,
Bed009_667	and and ; But but what it nee ; but th what the point is the ; in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven .
Btr002_2939	I agree . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Interesting observation .
Bmr012_840	you know . ; Sure . ; Just Mm - hmm . ; No the reason I say this
Bro019_86	That 's sort of ; OK . ; We um ; Yeah ?
Bmr027_743	Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . ; See , this is good . ; I wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings . ; Yeah . You could encrypt it ,
Bed003_931	Didn't do it . ; Oh . ; Oh wait , ; it might be
Bro018_1031	That 's ; Right . ; Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through , ; then run them through again
Bro018_661	and then divide by the sum of them , ; there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that . ; or ? ; Oh it i
Bmr016_1399	Oh yeah ? ; So . ; Well , or if you 're a C programmer . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1746	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But , eh , I I will try to recommend , eh , at , eh , the Spanish government
Bed002_881	OK , so it 's just like , " Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances " . ; Yeah , and and we will record both sides . ; I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard ; Uh - huh .
Bro010_820	So , uh , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , ; to test whether um , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . ; And then , um , it c it 's combined by a soft AND gate . ; And at the at the higher level ,
Bmr015_634	having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I did discover a couple other things by doing this though , ; and one of them is that ,
Bmr006_1381	Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; Yeah .
Bro017_1159	Turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think you can show that uh uh analytically . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_480	Cross ; Yeah , cross - correlation . ; Cross ; I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , uh , uh , voice , uh you know , active miking ,
Bmr026_678	So , ; uh , uh , ; Liz and Jane probably . ; OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting .
Bmr012_855	Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters , ; Yeah . ; so shouldn't use you should s you know , get ; Yeah , I mean I 'll I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same ,
Bns001_494	OK ; Oh , OK . ; Good luck . ; The the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas .
Bro014_379	Right . ; you know , ; and and and say here 's how much you , uh you improve the , uh the the relatively clean case ; and here 's
Bsr001_358	aren't you ? ; I mean , no . ; and people use it for cell phones ; Yeah , it 's weird .
Bro011_137	cuz because um ; uh I was talking with Hynek about it later ; and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . ; And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things
Bed013_1440	Hmm . ; And um , ; so that 's cool . ; Can a do more funky stuff .
Bmr005_105	or what ? ; Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , ; so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_809	I can actually combine them with something like ROVER . ; It 's actually more sophisticated than ROVER ; but it 's ; Um , here I got forty - eight point five
Bro005_651	and but with a lot of context also . ; So Um ; Yeah , ; we still have to work on Finnish ,
Bro010_76	No , I mean , because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing ,
Bmr005_494	I I I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , ; but eh the the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . ; And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , ; it 's possible you eh in the eh
Bed005_156	Yeah . ; So it 's basically feature film and TV . ; Today ; That 's what you need .
Bro015_70	It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided , that this is how things are leaning
Bmr027_649	Whereas , I I mean , I would be much more likely myself , ; And the other th ; given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever , ; rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it ,
Bro025_149	How how is how good is that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I don't have a sense of ; It 's just one percent off of the best proposal .
Bmr010_1110	No . ; But what I mean is ; Oh , I shouldn't say it that way ; because that does sound like forty - hour weeks .
Bro014_1205	Mm - hmm . ; That 's like fundamental frequency . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr026_494	Or ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean . Cuz we we have the uncompressed around also . ; Right .
Bmr003_2204	the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in . ; And there 's a there 's a plug on the end of each of these these , uh , ei eight cables . ; What ; OK .
Bmr016_15	I did collect an agenda . ; So I 'm gonna go first . ; Mwa - ha - ha ! ; It shouldn't take too long .
Bro019_1297	yeah . ; Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything , ; because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1267	and I think just having three different sites would be great ; That 'd be great . ; Yeah , ; I agree .
Bro010_1112	Hmm . ; because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . ; And , uh ; Hmm .
Bmr020_1783	Oh , you can tell . ; Yeah . ; Acoustically , can't you tell ? ; It 's really good sound ,
Bmr020_986	But what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends um are actually close to the speech inside of that ; Yeah , ; uh ; I think Jane tightened these up by hand .
Bmr001_311	Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh ; uh OK maybe you th you 're the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart , ; but what if you have two of these things ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_807	So , ; b that 's OK , ; I mean b but the difference ; Yeah .
Bed010_587	So it 's they actually say " the monkey in front of the car , ; where 's the monkey ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German ,
Bro018_503	uh it 's uh ; It 's probably a good place to start . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_1053	Everybody ready ? ; Yeah . ; A one . ; You have to plug your ears , by the way uh Eric ,
Bns001_1047	Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , they are using WAP . ; Yeah ?
Bmr008_941	I mean I 'm no I wasn't thinking about that , ; I was just thinking , " Gee , I 'd like to know actually " ; I wasn't thinking ; oh No , no .
Bro004_606	So . Training and test noise are different . ; So why do you get your best number in ; Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ? ; Well , it 's relative to the um baseline mismatching
Btr001_243	That 's interesting . ; Hmm - hmm . ; I can do I can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them ; Yeah .
Bro012_83	Didn't say anything ? ; But . I mean the thing is it was ; since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , ; but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .
Bro012_1382	Well . Cuz we don't have ; Why not ? ; Well , for Italian perhaps we have , ; but we don't have this labeling for Aurora .
Btr001_2599	And you did also ? ; We we are meant to be transcribing if they 're just left in the the curly brackets ? ; Kinda early on . ; No ,
Bed002_816	And so , you have basically the same tasks again , ; just with different objects , ; and you go through it again , ; and that was it .
Bmr029_500	Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes , ; and then , uh , in order to ; The the other difference that we 'd have to take care of is that , ; uh yeah , we we don't have a mike that , uh , is particular to a person .
Bro026_1029	And so ; Right . ; If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters Uh ; Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i
Bmr027_1359	Hmm . ; I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . ; Uh , so I can grab stuff there . ; And if , uh if I have some questions I 'll
Bro019_720	The well wa matched has mismatch ? ; has has also some slight mismatches , ; unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched ; Perfect to match .
Bro024_73	we we spoke about it already , ; Oh , OK . ; yeah . ; So you know what he 's doing .
Bmr010_549	it i the it 's basically a two - tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who 's interrupted continues or not . ; And then below that there 're subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , you know , is it , uh , simply backchannel ; Mm - hmm . ; or is it , um , someone completing someone else 's thought ,
Btr002_737	And so you turn it down ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; um yeah ,
Bmr031_1354	With it . ; Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect . ; OK . ; So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement .
Bro027_2048	When is the evaluation ? ; November , ; or something ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_221	Cuz ; That 's That 's uh cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right , ; Huh ? ; I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do .
Bro027_1384	Yeah , you c you c you can . ; And then feed it to HMM . ; I mean , it 's you know , you 're just basically i ; Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile .
Bmr023_384	So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation ; f for just very few days you were away . ; Yeah . ; But it happened to be during that time I needed one ,
Bro016_363	Uh , also the another parameter is relates with the auto - correlation function . ; Uh - huh . ; R - ze energy and the variance a also of the auto - correlation function . ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_379	Huh ? ; no transcriptions of course , ; No , we won't have the transcriptions , ; yeah .
Bns001_1610	Could be . ; And then we could have eh discussion ; and maybe this one is an overall work , in principle , where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it ; Yeah .
Buw001_2213	So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . ; But that 's not really a specific fact . ; I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , ; which I thought was worthwhile .
Bro012_946	Hmm ? ; Spectral subtraction , I guess . ; It 's applied before variance normalization . ; or
Buw001_1399	Mm - hmm . ; I agree . ; Right . ; I will say that that I I chose " interesting "
Bmr031_125	and , um , ; that 's it . ; So , um , I don't think we 'll hear from him before he gets back . ; OK .
Bed003_1337	Food and drink and so forth . ; So . I mean . ; But i you know , i we can ; Something Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we
Bmr016_948	and and it it will be ; Uh - huh . ; yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , ; but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out
Bro017_1217	Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report . ; Lucash , I think , uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system . ; reasonably uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel , ; but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything .
Bro016_859	But it 's probably pretty close to what a a a discrete cosine transformation is doing . ; Yeah . ; But still it 's it 's not gonna probably radically change the scale of things . ; I would think .
Bns001_479	But in this case , maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service ; because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a w with what the user is is using . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bed006_1404	And it 's gonna get more and more complex the the l complexer and larger our domains get . ; Sigh . ; And I think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon . ; So this is nice about being being recorded also .
Bed013_1349	Yeah . ; Absolutely fine . ; But this is the sort of thing , I I propose that we think about , ; OK .
Bmr028_1533	But . ; Did you read the paper ? ; But weren't you cheating in those experiments ? ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1175	eh here Is easy for people to know ? ; exactly what we 're arguing about . ; That 's ; Yeah , w It 's In It 's it 's harder in America anywhere else , basically .
Bmr009_500	it 's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction . ; If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then then ; yeah . ; And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here .
Bro024_948	So it 's not the mel . ; You know , it 's not the mel filter bank output . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2119	Speed ; Yeah , it 's like a speed bum An ; Speed bump . ; A " sleeping policeman " !
Bro019_593	um , ; when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . ; Um , ; but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization .
Bro008_154	Or ; Uh , they didn't report it , if they did . ; N nobody reported it ? ; Yeah .
Bro027_261	Eight . ; Oh , eh , great . ; No problems . ; And , um , I grabbed the sample stuff
Btr002_195	Yeah . So so . ; Mm - hmm . ; Do you wanna ; Actually , that comes back to a point .
Bmr020_1744	Yeah . ; So just put them on some other channel . ; But , ; when thi when this is sent to to the I M - eh , I B M transcribers , I don't know if if they can tell that 's really
Bro007_361	right ? ; I mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bed003_1144	Mm - hmm . ; He 's Like this guy has ? ; The JavaBayes guy ? ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1854	you know . ; Good . ; Worry about it when we get back . ; Let
Bed006_1093	You know , like what ; Well it 's not it 's not actually a very actually , it doesn't actually ; Um it occur it occurs to me that I mean ne ; Right .
Bns002_1309	Yeah . ; to be compatible with existing digital European cordless telephones . ; So , hopefully , we will be able to use some of our old devices or maybe our our cordless phone base station at home , with a computer . S ; S So I think some really nice applications will will appear .
Bro007_186	Yeah . ; So so there 's so I I would put that one also as a as a maybe . ; Uh and it ; yeah and it 's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian ,
Bed017_122	Maybe you have your on - line ; Uh , ; yeah , sure . ; Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um ,
Bmr009_1040	Yeah . ; Yeah , I certainly don't . ; I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak . ; It 's like Northwest
Bro023_1159	Well , it ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah ,
Bro005_169	the huge table , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , ; but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP .
Bmr014_310	I mean is he d is he definitely not available today ? ; I don't know . ; Should I call his office and see ? ; Uh , well i it 's uh
Bns003_473	Yep . ; And the stuff itself is , uh , located at our server . ; In our directory . ; Yeah ,
Bns002_1095	that may that the different parts could be one to number four . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe two - B or three - B
Btr002_679	where the microphone went int went into a box ; Mm - hmm . ; I was trying trying to think of this as prior to ; yes , it was prior to the wireless .
Bns002_203	because uh a node 's moving , the route is changing , ; so w one can think that routing in this uh scenario is is a complex thing . ; But the problem is if w we just uh try to put more power in each tr transmitter , ; so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop ,
Bed014_903	It 's i Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon ? ; Yeah , it was th ; OK . It was th off this week , ; Yeah . I always thought it was staying .
Bmr028_49	Is that because the transcripts get longer ? ; Yeah . ; The f transcript file gets longer ? ; Yeah . Yep .
Bro024_894	Yep . ; C - z C - zero and log energy also , ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Buw001_376	because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface ; and he 's looking at the query in in ; i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff ; but we have zero hours of of of queries .
Bro012_192	But I don't think it indicates something , really . ; I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust ; Uh - huh . ; or
Bro008_456	and , uh ; what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . ; Uh Uh I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . ; We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction .
Bsr001_1600	We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with . ; Yeah . ; But these are all components that are obvious to us how to build . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr015_130	Four thousand . ; Four thous Ah ! Four thousand . ; Four thousand ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr027_761	Backwards . ; Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , ; But , ; ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments .
Bed011_285	I 'm sorry . ; No , we have to help we have to decide . ; Fey will p carry out whatever we decide . ; But we have to decide you know , what is the appropriate scenario .
Bro026_299	Mm - hmm . ; It , uh , ; In terms of ranking ? ; Second .
Bmr010_999	Well , they they 're very perce ; they 'll So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " , ; not really " and " , ; Yeah .
Bro023_455	It works for Italian because the VAD was trained on Italian . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh ; so this was , uh
Bro004_82	Yeah . ; Hold on . ; Hold on . ; OK .
Bro027_1595	So it still has most of the delay , ; So ; it just doesn't ; Yeah ,
Bed016_287	Interesting . ; Oh , it 's pretty slow . ; Yeah , you have to ; Wh
Bro027_136	Yeah . ; And and TI - digits maybe is not so much as ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed008_366	and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . ; So the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , ; the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark ; is it a place of business
Bed015_636	Which which I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive ; but they 're they 're different meanings . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_718	are there currently is uh ; no syntactic analysis ; but in the next release there will be some . ; Hmm .
Bmr022_120	Oh , you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it seems now , if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off . ; Well the only the only question about that that I have is , um , I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape .
Bro007_462	do we have the features ? ; Yeah . ; For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . ; Uh the clean training stuff .
Bro017_1087	Yeah . ; so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , " this plane is uh uh passing " ; then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub . ; And they were calling from the pub .
Bmr026_1070	But But so I ; You know , it 's ; Well but i ; Sort of given up guessing .
Bro008_19	Oh yeah . ; So um , I wan wanna wanna see what that is . ; But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later . ; But it looks like , um
Bro010_1021	or ? ; Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? ; Other low level detectors ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1426	But it 's mostly non - native ; S OK . ; H ; That 's " eh " versus " ah " ?
Bro016_58	But , they raised a very valid point , ; which , I guess ; So , to first order I mean , you have other things you were gonna do , ; but to first order , I would say that the conclusion is that if you , um , do , uh , some monkeying around with , uh , the exact HTK training and @ @ with , uh , you know , how many states and so forth , that it it doesn't particularly improve the performance .
Bro014_891	which ; Or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ? ; Ho - how does it work ? ; Right now we just are trying to find some features .
Bed011_794	But a I as a tourist , I 'll just paying what 's what 's more or less is required . ; Well , no . ; I think there are there 're different things where you have a ch choice , ; Mmm .
Bmr011_277	Yeah . ; OK , so , um , uh , ; Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February ; and I 've spoken with , uh , u u a lot of people here ,
Bmr010_83	uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain ; with , uh , Manolo Pardo and Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was here before , ; was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . ; So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um
Bmr016_84	Yeah ; Um , do um ; you want different prosodics , ; so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ?
Bed013_715	Yeah , maybe you have It would be kind of The paper ha would have , in my vision , a nice flow if we could say , well here is th the th here is parsing if you wanna do it c right , ; here is understanding if you wanna do it right , ; and you know without going into technical ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_954	So the best - case scenario would be the number of constructions ; or , the worst - case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons . ; Well , two to the power of the number of neurons . ; Right .
Bmr001_460	I mean it will be different subsets . ; So you won't you won't , you know , do all sixteen channels in a single ; That 's true . ; I hadn't even thought about that , although it 'd be kind of interesting .
Bro003_1533	Well , ; to ; It 's Nutmeg and Mustard , I think , ; Do you know these yet ?
Bmr014_201	Everyone 's battery OK ? ; I checked them this morning , ; they should be . ; OK .
Bro023_665	And that creates a lot of discontinuities across the spectrum because @ @ the filter . ; So , ; uh , ; so that 's what that was just the first stage of Wiener filtering that I tried .
Bmr021_924	And that would blow up the ; You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they 're uh orthogonal . ; uh ; Right .
Bmr016_707	Yeah . ; right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , ; but using um , you know , more than energy ; I I don't know what exactly would go into it .
Bsr001_1562	None of that . ; N no eating during meetings . ; Right , right , right . ; Yes ,
Bmr019_359	Oh . ; Right ? ; Then , eh because you you don't have any ; Right .
Bmr025_51	whenever they want them . ; Well the second one of those ; Cool . ; Yep . It 's already at IBM ,
Bmr029_787	I I I got confused , ; cuz I thought I thought you were using the whole Macrophone set . ; Mm - hmm . ; No .
Btr002_1724	Exactly ! ; cuz I can whistle so high . " ; Wow . ; And you were like , w " That 's fascinating . "
Bmr012_1411	yeah yesterday with Liz . ; About doing some of the echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , ; so . ; Cool .
Bro003_1037	That would be ; Uh , ; yeah , ; so PLP and MSG I think we definitely wanna try
Bmr015_1082	and and , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , to process it for the speech recognition side . ; Discourse side will have
Bmr018_849	yeah it 's ; If you had a if you had a s if you had a script which would ; I 've thought about this , ; I mean , if you have any ideas .
Bro014_1147	Yeah . ; I see . ; So do you have a picture that sh ? ; Is this for a voiced segment ,
Bro021_652	Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two ; OK . ; and an epsilon cubed over three , ; and so forth .
Bro003_737	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think I think Dan did some of that . ; Oh .
Bmr025_297	And if it doesn't ; Right ? ; Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? ; Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so .
Bmr022_946	It 's an interesting idea . ; people like that . ; The acoustics ; the acoustics on this are really s m better than when I talk into it directly .
Bmr012_217	Wow . ; so ; I 'm not ; Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch .
Bmr011_1819	Mm - hmm . ; Um , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , ; Cuz i ; OK .
Bmr025_96	so the front - end is the user interface ; and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . ; And so I 've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats . ; And the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working .
Bmr023_1166	But ; Yeah . ; So that would save a lot of time . ; And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets .
Btr001_2604	I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it , ; Yeah , they do write the numbers in . ; The ; Yeah .
Bro011_557	and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . ; So look at the difference there ; and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . ; What which test set was this ?
Bed016_133	Hmm . ; in our beloved tourism domain . ; But , with a focus on ; Can I s
Bro023_1079	Yeah . ; But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction . ; Um , yeah . ; Right .
Btr001_2099	Right . Right , right . ; comes back , ; and no one knows . ; Gets bored .
Bmr008_792	It can't be relied on only . ; Right . ; The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other . ; So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties .
Bmr009_1264	I mean I had it wide open last week and and you said TIMIT . ; And . ; What if we put in both ? ; Yeah .
Bed015_1570	If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever . ; If it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ? ; Or something in ontology . ; uh - huh .
Bsr001_2579	Although unfortunately , you know , they 're all pretty close , ; Hmm . ; right ? ; t Uh
Bmr016_1821	Right . Right . ; So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , ; but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_947	Well , we do because of privacy . ; We can't just make it openly available on the web . ; No , no . ; You 're missing the point .
Bmr018_311	I 'll work on that . ; No , I 'm s I 'm actually serious . ; So it will miss stuff like that which ; Well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do .
Bns003_506	because then they 're still cau still a growing context for us , opportunity for the people you know there , ; " Oh , ; this guy did something there , ; maybe I can contact him and ask him would you like to do something , contribute , whatever . "
Bro024_1043	you know ? ; Yeah . ; So if they include the delta , it will be an additional forty millisecond . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1039	Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I certainly don't . ; I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak .
Bmr008_1014	and then you have , uh other people who are just the reverse , and and it ; Yes . ; so many things that vary I ; And also we wanna keep it simple and non - evaluative .
Bro024_1835	This is with the clean . ; OK . ; With the noise I have worse result , that if I doesn't use it . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_1744	It seems like a problem with cross - talk . ; e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , uh , room acoustic ; Yeah . ; but I I think the rest is cross - talk .
Bsr001_1098	Is that in exchange for access to the c ; Right , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_58	Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr001_724	Yeah . ; I mean . ; But I think that 's alright . ; Yeah , it 's great .
Bmr016_104	if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one . ; I well OK I it might help , ; I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . ; That 's what I was asking , yeah .
Bro008_11	yeah . ; I I 'm sorry ? ; I didn't ; Um , I got this from you
Bns003_288	Uh , there there there are couple of comments I I have about the web pages . ; Good . ; One is is the , uh , I think it 's Joe 's , uh , graphic , I think it should be better . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah ,
Bro028_767	D Do you know what kind of tying they use ? ; Are they they sort of some sort of a bunch of Gaussians that they share across everything ? ; Or or if it 's ? ; Yeah , th I have I I I don't have it up here
Bns001_675	You mean now for GSM , @ @ , ; Doesn't it ? ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bro013_715	um so um we we have this um block least squares um imp echo canceller implementation ; and um I want to try finding the the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller ; and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_991	If that 's clear . ; It 's pretty cute . ; OK . ; But at any rate .
Btr001_2084	Oh . ; for the fire code or whatever it is . ; Oh , wow . ; Oh .
Bmr020_1086	Um ; So ; for the minimum silence length . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1042	yeah . ; And they are t ; I think they want to work on the second stream also , ; but more with some kind of multi - band
Btr002_208	OK , right ? ; And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that " so that would be hard " , comma , " so " ; at the end . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2508	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know what I am never sure whether or not to transcribe , um , a difference with , like , " hmm " , you know , and " hmm ! " . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr008_1149	yeah . ; Yep . ; or , ; I mean , where you don't wanna sort of have to make a distinction between a pre - existing relationship , or
Bmr022_1417	Right . ; You know , p anybody can check out the code , ; but not everybody can check it in . ; Right . And there 's some happy medium
Bmr010_460	collections at at UW ; I mean Dan Dan is very interested in doing some other things , ; Right . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr016_1984	There is . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 've added that all now too .
Bsr001_370	Right , ; OK . ; cuz you 've got ; It 's You know ?
Bmr019_1324	Right . ; No . ; So ; No .
Bmr013_325	Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . ; Do you mean , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it .
Bro004_548	yeah . ; At least at least for the first for the well - matched , ; Well matched condition . ; yeah .
Bmr021_437	And if you have , you know , twenty channels and only five speakers , then it 's ; That 's true . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , assuming you 'd Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original Switchboard files .
Btr001_1812	Yeah . ; Huh . ; Huh . ; It 's it depends on the person ,
Bns002_833	That 's really right , ; Hmm ? ; but what I would like to say is that besides the RTS CTS behavior , you need certain kind of additional MAC layer functionality to deal with these packet . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bed002_1014	Now , how you determine that is another issue . ; But fo for the current problem , it would just be , " OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , " or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power ; and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , " pppt ! " ; Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,
Bmr028_1403	I 'm actually using this other thing . ; OK . ; That 's that 's that 's the reason . ; OK . Alright .
Bdb001_1281	But they 've also ; Exactly . ; And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_62	Well and it 's also relevant to status . ; I c I can insert that . ; and relevant to status . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_494	Right . ; For the full band . ; But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is ; um I guess one way of describing would be
Bed005_384	Mmm . ; M - three - L dot DTD ? ; Yep . ; That 's just a specification for the XML format .
Btr002_2358	Mm - hmm . ; It 's like ; " tisk " . ; and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . "
Bmr003_1144	There you go . ; Content words only . ; We could have some telegraphic meetings . ; That might be interesting .
Bro011_684	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things ; Yeah .
Bmr014_230	Right . ; Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets ; meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , ; right ?
Bed010_280	Maybe you 're done , then . ; and if you just take the ; And I g I got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system . ; I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running
Bro005_1291	So by the time you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score ; Mmm . ; and now there isn't any difference , ; Yeah .
Buw001_2289	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro028_390	puts in some degradation ; Uh - huh . ; that 's not what we 're used to hearing , ; and is , um
Bro013_435	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; OK . ; No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision .
Bro024_1279	more than on Italian . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , like music ; Yeah .
Bed005_95	um ; S i Jane may say that , " you know , you can't do this " , ; uh , " on the same form , we need a separate form . " ; But anyway . I 'd I 'd I 'd like to , e e um , add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial , saying " nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . "
Bro027_1435	LDA , neural nets , they 're good . ; Yeah . ; Uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . ; And PCA doesn't do that .
Bed006_1803	Sorry . ; Oh , OK . ; Um I can e I can uh I 'll transcribe it though . ; I take that back then .
Bro016_704	the data ? ; Do you know ? ; Mmm . ; Almost ,
Bmr015_267	Yeah . ; Cuz I had sent one earlier ; Actually the same thing happened to me I had sent one earlier . ; The message says , " You 'll be informed "
Bro021_1350	Yeah . ; No , it 's interesting . ; Uh , w we haven't had anybody work with it before , ; so it 's interesting to get your get your feedback about it .
Bro016_790	uh ; Knowing what the sum of the probabilities are , doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1056	Mm - hmm . ; But the goal there was to not have the text be so so crudely parsed in a time bin . ; I mean , because from a discourse m purpose it 's it 's more it 's more useful to be able to see ; and also you know , from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long a unit , it 's it doesn't help you very much either ,
Btr002_1681	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; I li that 's why I like Johno . ; It 's really funny to listen to .
Bdb001_770	when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ? ; But suppose we dump out this file ; and we say , uh , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ? ; OK .
Bro027_1918	That and the correlation between stuff . ; So if , ; uh ; if the , uh , high mismatch case had been more like the , uh , the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance , how would this number have changed ?
Bed006_236	Yeah , not only ; Also we will talk about Linguistics and of course Computer Science . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing ,
Bmr026_818	Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; and Um . ; So . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system
Bmr009_522	Pitch related ? ; Harmonicity and so on ? ; I I 'm preparing the the program but I don't I don't begin because eh I saw your email ; Preparing to
Bed009_235	So if it can make a good suggestion , " Hey ! " ; you know , " that person doesn't wanna enter . ; That person just wants to take a picture , " cuz he just bought film , ; or " that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before " .
Bmr025_222	How about having it run under free BSD ? ; Well what you need ; Free BSD would probably be easier . ; All you need to do is say to Dan " gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf " and it 'll be done in a day .
Bsr001_727	Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit . ; Oh .
Bns002_1241	Mmm . ; You know , ; in the beginning , uh what w the ; I think that to put things in perspective , what we need to know is what Bluetooth is and what Bluetooth is for .
Bmr014_563	It 'd be more than that ; Yeah . ; because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person . ; Oh , OK .
Bro003_763	Oh . ; Oh . Italian . ; I Italian yes . ; Italian ?
Bro027_1920	uh ; if the , uh , high mismatch case had been more like the , uh , the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance , how would this number have changed ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , it would be
Bmr015_919	the the ; Keep forgetting . ; I get the the spectrum , ; Yeah .
Bed012_680	When 's Jerry leaving for Italia ? ; On on Friday . ; Which Friday ? ; This this Friday .
Bmr002_1407	I had noticed that you were talking quietly , ; It 's bizarre . ; and I was actually going to ask you . ; yeah , this is not really my normal pattern .
Bed002_1259	in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable . ; OK . ; OK . ; S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic .
Bmr010_818	um ; They 're putting Eh , so in curly brackets they put " inhale " or " breath " . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_389	My approach originally , ; and I 've already hacked on it a little bit ; it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms . ; But he pointed out that you don't really have to .
Bmr003_402	Unless they added close field later on ; but , um , I 've listened to some of those data ; and I , um , I 've been I I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1084	A few . ; It 's really ; yeah , ; OK .
Bro003_1274	if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used . ; And uh , ; on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort " that 's ; Yeah .
Bed002_718	And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . ; So , yeah y you 're absolutely right , though . ; No , you you will not have , ; and there it is ,
Bed006_1798	You know . ; or do you want transcript ? ; No just just transcript . ; Yeah , well just transcript is just not available
Bns001_578	Or maybe talk to them about s operations they thought of but didn't touch yet . ; Yeah , well we are close . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh maybe a few comments .
Bmr023_375	Yeah . ; with the tighter boundaries . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And to use them for for training a or for fo whatever . Yeah .
Bro016_198	bu in these noisy cases , are ? We are seeing lots of insertions . ; Right ? ; The insertion number is quite high ? ; I know the VAD takes pre care of part of that ,
Bsr001_2338	When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking . ; And so I 'm loo interested in in well , in interested in looking at prosody . ; Um , ; Oh , cool .
Bro022_634	So it 's about the same , ; W w it was one one point two ; maybe a little worse . ; Ye
Bed010_1048	It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure . ; OK . ; So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , ; saying " here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand " .
Bed003_601	Make that false . ; Alright . ; And it 's night . ; Oh , they
Bmr003_835	So forty or fifty hours . ; Could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ? ; Right . ; And the the format 's really transparent .
Bed005_52	So , if you happen to be sort of in a non - student social setting , ; and you know people who may be interested in being subjects ; We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers , maybe , ; and get them interested in stuff .
Bmr008_971	What about something like " How comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in English ? " , ; or " How easy is it for you ? " , ; or something like that where it 's ; How b How About " How long have you been uh in in an English speaking country ? "
Bmr011_643	So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , ; but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . ; And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , ; I see .
Bsr001_2186	this this is something that re re requires a bootstrap . ; LDC is what we were thinking too . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_692	just by concatenating files together . ; Um , and if these files and the ; since they 're individual utterance files , um , s long silence periods are removed , ; which is a good thing .
Bro007_7	but um got tables in front of us . ; Um what is what does combo mean ? ; So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network ; and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features .
Bmr007_757	Yeah . ; Posture , and we could like , you know , block out the person 's face or whatever ; The fashion statement . ; but but , you know , these are important cues ,
Bro021_631	So then , ; um , ; um , ; you know , there might be some numerical issues .
Bro019_1196	OK . ; OK . ; And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_1550	I liked ; You miss ; Yeah , ; Oh ! I see .
Bro012_1214	Mm - hmm . ; And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_636	fff . ; So again , ; I can write down some of these eq ; Oh , OK .
Bro022_546	Well , there 's also the normalization . ; Like they do , ; um ; I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits ,
Bmr006_1659	Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . ; Yeah . Yeah , I think ; Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . ; Yeah .
Bro023_990	Oh . ; But it was just a thought that that it might be something to try . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_989	Yeah . Let me check with Robert again , ; but I I 'm pretty sure that there 's nothing this week . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro019_954	and ; it can be used for uh , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . ; Who is doing this ? ; Uh w working in the cepstral domain ?
Bed014_428	Monday ; or ? ; No , no , no . ; It 's a Friday .
Bmr003_1793	Do you have a sense of how long ; Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , ; but I didn't have any I didn't even have a ; OK .
Bmr010_1441	Yeah . ; So if we used another method to get the first pass , I think it would probably work . ; Yeah . Sure . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1081	Yeah . ; No ? ; And here we can multiply by X . ; Alright .
Buw001_22	Mm - hmm . ; But I definitely haven't figured it out . ; Um , Meeting Recorder meeting . ; I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something .
Bmr029_377	But ; Uh , Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know , um ; Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone . ; In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain .
Btr002_1746	but it was , like , also really interesting to watch , ; or to listen to . ; Both . ; Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap
Bmr007_463	I 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; And that 's all .
Bmr031_331	and ; But . ; But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance . ; Right .
Bed006_360	Because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , or as much as they can , of that phrasing . ; Hmm . ; Um , are you worried about being able to identify ; OK .
Bro003_94	Anyway , ; so . ; Will that be enough time ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_148	So , ; uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan , ; and ; where am I ?
Buw001_110	So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk note - taking things , ; then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . ; Mm - hmm . ; y if if we were able to to do that .
Bmr018_598	trimodal , ; Yeah . ; so ; There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot .
Bmr008_594	So , you could say " What region did you grow up in from these years ? " ; and have a set of circ of six or seven circles ; Yeah , that that 's good ; but if you have it totally free - form First of all some people take you
Bmr009_890	you 're gonna already have the date , and the s ; What which form are you talking about ? ; Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one . ; This is the digit form .
Bed015_174	but we don't want to ; Yeah , uh , there was one time when when Hans explained why " constraints " was a misleading word for him . ; Yep . ; And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term ,
Bmr012_288	Oh , and ; What happens is it actually affects the script that Don ; Huh . ; I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it
Btr001_1663	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bro008_364	Yeah . ; And the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing . ; Yeah . ; Uh , OK ,
Bmr018_1456	yeah . ; Well , I like the idea that Adam had of of , um , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have ; because it would be easy to to to do that ; just , you know ,
Bed006_714	and it doesn't ; Well , that wouldn't have helped you at all . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed011_476	This is limiting the choices , but yeah . ; Right . ; OK , sorry . ; But um I I think this approach will very well work ,
Bro018_467	uh which is ; Actually , let me ; Hold that thought . ; Yeah .
Bro014_818	what sorts of features are you looking at ? ; We have some ; So we would be looking at , um , the variance of the spectrum of the excitation , ; uh , um , this , this , and this .
Btr002_794	So . ; in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , that kind of thing .
Bmr019_1401	um . ; So . ; I don't know . ; Anyway .
Bmr031_290	Yeah . ; would be helpful . ; but most of them aren't transcribed . ; So if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them , we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus .
Bmr003_637	I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . ; Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . ; Right ? ; Right ?
Bmr009_87	And you can sort of see that , because of j of just putting it on the board that if you sort of have log - X plus log - X , that 's the log of X plus the log of two ; Yep . ; Yeah , maybe it 's not log distributed . ; Mmm .
Btr002_3129	Oh ! I was just I was just saying that , um , I I can I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced . ; Yes . ; So if it 's " er " , I write an " R " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_90	So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation . ; Why I had I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , ; mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb , ; You have to switch it on .
Bro021_865	I I must to say that . ; Which is which is the log domain ? ; Is the T is egual is equal to , uh , log of ; And
Bmr022_571	Right , ; h ; an expert can't even tell what they 're talking about . ; Yeah .
Bed004_650	and then it would have values , uh , " Tour " , " Business " , or uh " Hurried " . ; Right . ; But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters . ; Right .
Bmr031_147	but it 's probably better to describe . ; Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ? ; So Roughly . Almost . ; Not quite .
Bmr023_888	Yeah . Right . ; We d weren't able to separate them out ; cuz it was just done in one thing . ; But then there was a point eight percent which was something else .
Bns001_752	you know , ; because you cannot use these things . ; And WAP is not an answer for for these kind of things , ; you know .
Bmr011_1653	Yeah . ; if you know any groups that are m you know , ; Well I had asked some some of the students at the business school . ; Yeah .
Bns002_933	uh is it worth to have it ? ; If I really , with a normal device uh with a battery lifetime of maybe twenty - four hours , thirty - six hours or whatever kind of thing And I think it will be increased . ; As the more mobile nodes are in the world the better the battery will be . ; So that 's was the reason for my question .
Bmr012_258	Oh . ; Right . ; so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second ; Mmm .
Buw001_154	I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B . ; I 'm Dan Ellis . ; Eric on channel nine . ; Liz , on channel one .
Bmr008_746	is that ; They 'll probably listen to the speech , ; so ; Well , I you know , I w I was thinking of it as e
Bro011_269	OK . ; F um ; u ; Delegate .
Bro005_1359	Yeah . ; Right . ; What 's what 's that ? ; Um , I 'm trying to
Bmr006_1396	Oh , right , oh , yeah . ; And if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity ; Yeah . ; Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array .
Bmr014_16	OK . ; MR eleven . ; MR eleven . ; That sounds like a spy code .
Bsr001_555	Mm - hmm . ; And I really liked it ; but , other people didn't . ; So it just depends .
Bmr029_21	Mm - hmm . ; and do the look at the same thing . ; And in talking this morning with , uh , Chuck and with Dave one thought was to use ; We couldn't remember how different the numbers were ,
Bmr025_364	and then that 'll give us a week or so . ; Oh , the end of this month or next month ? ; Ooo . The end of ; This month .
Bro022_555	Their normalization works like on on the utterance levels . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we have to do it ; We have a system that does it on - line .
Bed015_1878	uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , ; which is that , um , ; it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . ; Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n
Bro027_801	Yeah . ; So you you were get ; If you add a g good v very good VAD , that works as well as a VAD working on clean speech , ; Yeah .
Bmr031_717	Yeah . ; Yeah . The problem with that for backed - up media is , uh , the sysadmins wanna keep them at eighteen meg eighteen gig partitions ; shuffle it around . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_886	Right ? ; Yeah . Those those two were together . ; Yeah . Right . ; We d weren't able to separate them out
Bed014_204	So . ; Or ; Oregon . ; Oregon @ @ Graduate Institute
Bro005_741	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be ; uh , ; yeah ,
Bro004_290	but it includes the but it includes the broad English data . ; I think so . ; Do you ; Uh , Yeah .
Btr001_2472	Yeah , ; that 's that 's ; Huh , OK . ; It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time .
Bmr027_1185	Come on . ; Right . ; Yeah . If you need it . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1791	isn't there a category something like uh , " sounds for someone for whom there is no i close mike " ? ; Yeah that would be very important , ; Yeah . ; But how do we d how do we do that for the I B M folks ?
Bns002_1144	And that ca what can be u really useful is to reduce the global power consumption in the routing function . ; So , ; because in this way , ; well , maybe one node is is being forced to use more power
Bmr009_1647	Yeah . ; Yeah , don't Don't read the old one . ; Alright . ; The And the time is .
Bmr008_478	uh I I I just missed something , though . ; Are you saying that you have both ? ; Mm - hmm . ; that you 're saying , uh what is your
Bro019_892	that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro019_964	Uh , Jose Carlos Segura . ; I don't know him . ; This VTS has been proposed by CMU ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_484	and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . ; And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . ; But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , ; the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .
Bmr019_1325	No . ; So ; No . ; Nah .
Bmr030_151	Hmm . ; You have olt Alt Tab and ; Hold down at hold down Alt , ; and then tap Tab several times
Bed009_690	Hmm . ; But of course the the more complex ; Yeah , there is another philosophical issue that I think you know you can evade ; yep .
Bmr021_473	Oh , different ones ? ; I don't remember where I put them now . ; I think you put them on XE . ; OK .
Bed003_1441	huh ? ; inferring everything from the context . ; So , works . ; Um , even though there is probably no train from here to New York ,
Bro023_1355	Yeah . ; So , yeah , it depends . ; Uh , y actually , it 's it 's l it 's three percent . ; Right .
Bro012_94	but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance , ; so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate . ; So . So uh , but uh , ; Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went " oh , man .
Bmr016_1395	Ah . ; We 're gonna never recognize this meeting . ; OK . ; In Monty Python you say " argh " a lot .
Bro017_890	No . ; Yeah . ; But I think it 's uh the The variance is on on the denominator in the in the Gaussian equation . ; So . I think it 's maybe it 's the contrary .
Bmr002_1175	OK . ; We need a lot of I mean ; Well , what the so , the reason we 're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we wanna back we want some something that will work . ; Well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately .
Bro005_101	Uh , so this is training the net on French only , ; or on English only , ; and testing on Italian . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_816	Yeah . That 's right . ; Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special . ; Right . Exactly . ; So . I mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine .
Bmr026_324	Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , ; Yeah . ; so all of those need to be expanded , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_480	It 's ; Yeah . ; I don't know . ; Hmm , interesting .
Bmr002_1110	I would think . ; Right ? ; Right , since we have almost none right now , let 's ; Yeah .
Bro026_359	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . ; Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth
Bed014_1308	which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all . ; Yeah . ; So it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to communicate this story ; Yeah .
Bro027_712	right ? ; Um , ; and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , ; but
Bmr021_105	because it 's hard to adjust the microphone . ; Right . ; I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it ; and still not reasonable ,
Bro014_340	Some people think that it 's more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched , ; and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch ; and ; It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be .
Buw001_1768	and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with . ; OK , excellent . ; Um , ; OK .
Bro003_706	Uh , ; yeah . ; What about mel cepstrum ? ; Oh , um
Bmr008_1399	But are we assuming that you could know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ? ; I mean I can imagine a model where you say , OK , you know I 'm I 'm gonna give myself ; And And And did is this from the mixed signal ? ; it 's cheating ,
Bns001_583	Yeah . ; No problem . ; So that everybody ; Uh I I will send also the pointer which Miguel sent to me , to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh , project .
Bmr013_263	Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , ; wouldn't it ? ; To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? ; It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g
Buw001_839	And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . ; But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , uh , subsets of that . ; Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , ; Of the board .
Bed013_849	What ? ; You guys are too young . ; You know like " Sussudio " , ; that horrible , horrible song that should never have been created .
Bro003_1993	we have gotten soft targets to to work . ; OK . ; So that that 'll work , ; yeah .
Bro011_281	I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . ; Um . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . ; So uh this is especially true for the lapel ; but even for the close close - miked uh cases
Bmr019_1104	It 's just a ASCII line by line format , ; but it does give you information ; It 's the it 's the spurt format . ; It Yeah , we 're calling these " spurts " after Chafe .
Bdb001_652	No . ; I don't know ; I take that back . ; So here 's the thing .
Bmr016_300	and number of digits in a group , ; and the pattern of groupings . ; Mm - hmm . ; Are the patterns like are they based on anything or
Bed011_429	but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds . ; Yeah . ; Could be . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_174	Yeah . ; Oh sure . ; And it would be , you know of course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , ; and i and I and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more ,
Bmr027_1320	That 's it . ; It 's great to be able to do it , ; Good . ; just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig ,
Bmr013_761	and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group ; Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I didn't know in the group you had if you had
Bmr006_1695	I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef ; if you wanted to anonymize . ; Yeah . Yeah , is ; " Is you know who up in you know where ? "
Bmr024_311	That 's great . ; Yeah . ; So I think that that 's gonna , also eh , you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process . ; Hmm .
Bmr009_721	I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , ; I don't think you need to . ; no ? ; yeah .
Bro011_87	um So , yeah . ; Oh OK . ; We should have a look first at , perhaps , the modulation spectrum . ; OK .
Bmr020_1439	so . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_995	A lot of them were like , you know . ; Yep . ; Command line . ; Huh .
Bro012_1398	So there 's no phone models that you get alignments for . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; You So you could find out where the word boundaries are
Bmr015_1005	be able that ; in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , ; so maybe ; And I was
Bed013_100	maybe learn new things . ; And um , ; so there 's no no end of potential things one could get out of it , if that works . ; And he would like to actually work on that with us .
Bro024_37	I ran some tests last night . ; But , um , ; c ; the results are suspicious .
Bed003_783	Good point . ; Yeah ? ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1604	but maybe they did . ; I don't know . ; That may be all over the literature . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1688	Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . ; That 's right . ; Oh . Yeah , right . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3021	Yeah . Cuz I was thinking , like , you 're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible . ; Well ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , I 'm glad you said that
Bro010_368	Oh , KLT . ; Mm - hmm . ; KLT , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_474	Yeah . ; So . ; so , ; Well , it would be lost no matter what you do .
Bro011_289	taking the input from other mikes and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . ; So . ; Um what was it , ; there was there was some some some point where eh uh Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel
Bmr019_97	And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_148	not on the meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; You could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_473	Alth ; Oh , yeah . ; I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out . ; Oh yeah .
Bro027_750	You know . ; So it 's ; We 're we 're doing better . ; I mean , we 're getting better recognition .
Bmr015_60	I mean , I won't say much , ; but uh , but then , uh , you said wanna talk about digits ? ; I have a short thing about digits ; and then uh I wanna talk a little bit about naming conventions ,
Bmr028_1133	Noise estimate . ; Signal to noise . ; Right ? Yeah . ; That 's great .
Bro024_376	So . ; And I I g I guess I s just started thinking of another question , ; which is , for for the very first frame , w what what do I do ; if I 'm if I take if I use that frame to calculate the mean , then I 'm just gonna get n nothing .
Bed012_604	What d what do they need to do left ? ; Um , ; I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , ; but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later .
Bro019_271	So . ; Um , what what about ; I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_894	Right . ; I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind ; but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now ; and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech
Bmr014_713	OK there 's ; I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . ; OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . " ; Yeah .
Bro017_832	Because you would be providing severe mismatch . ; But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ? ; And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had . ; No that would be very good match ,
Bed014_631	which probably will blow all our theories , ; but but skipping that ; Yeah , right . ; so so but my guess is what what 'll probably will happen , Here 's a here 's a proposed design . is that there 're certain constructions which , uh , for our purposes do change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds
Bed009_269	That 's the d ; Hmm . ; OK , yeah . ; So this is one that already adds additional information to the
Bro007_424	this is probably channel error stuff ; well , you ; Yeah . ; huh ?
Bro024_1657	Mmm ; Uh , no , ; it 's it 's just the gain that 's smoothed actually ; Uh , actually I d I do all the smoothing .
Bro010_851	And then he uses , uh , i u and then feeding into that are ; I 'm sorry , ; there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr022_723	He he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to . ; Which is which is really a good a good way to do it . ; OK . ; So we can just map
Bmr013_1048	Oh , god . ; Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . ; Yeah ? ; Just start saying " M four " .
Bro014_727	Um . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it has the , uh ; the latencies are much shorter .
Bmr013_607	Yeah . ; so , um , ; I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . ; Oh , great .
Bmr001_358	Excuse me , nine . ; Yeah . ; Five with wireless and four without , and four with wired . ; Yeah .
Bro013_103	just just using having the H M Ms much better H M ; Just ; f for the HMM models . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1021	This is absolutely natural meetings . ; We have absolutely no effect from our preconceptions . ; So , we had ; Right .
Bns002_999	and also for multicast traffic , ; on these networks ; And eh well some day in the future eh , a protocol should be chosen ; but , for the moment eh we have several of them on the table .
Bmr005_1033	Uh , yeah , I I think ; I mean , is it something of interest ? ; definitely s so Absolutely . ; Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .
Bmr009_713	Mm - hmm . ; and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels Jane gave ; Coming off of the other ; Yeah .
Bmr009_200	Right . So , we don't know what they look like on the , tsk For the raw . ; But he didn't h have it for the energy . ; He had it for the derivatives . ; Yeah .
Bed014_992	That doesn't apply to a ; Get a fresh start ; Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday er , take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping . ; Yeah , that 's another s thing . Yeah .
Bmr021_489	Oh . Uh - huh . ; And it shouldn't be . ; Right ? ; That data never gets touched ,
Bmr006_240	Yeah . ; We 'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them . ; " Age - ist " . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr027_412	I mean , i it 's k ; Hmm . ; Well , then we make the effort . ; And do we want to spend that effort ?
Bmr003_639	Right ? ; Right ? ; N right . ; That 's
Bmr001_13	Yeah , OK , ; maybe I 'll put this thing here then . ; OK . ; OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand ,
Bro005_1146	but ; It works better if what ? ; Yea ; I see .
Bmr006_1715	That 's that 's the issue . ; I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . ; Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . ; Well .
Btr001_482	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I mean , I think I know the mistake she 's making . ; And ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_2153	Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . ; I we have a our local expert on P R ; uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . ; But we 'll we 'll have to see .
Bro027_1313	yeah . ; So , ; until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1438	And then also , um , working with Jeremy on Communicator emotion labelling . ; And most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion ; and that 's going pretty well now . ; What kind of emotions do you label ?
Bed011_797	Mmm . ; for example , uh this t interacts with " do am I do oh are you willing to take a taxi ? " ; Yeah . ; Dinner .
Bro003_1493	but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines . ; And we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster . ; So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_127	It 's eee messy ; but once you understand it you understand it . ; It 's it 's There 's nothing really complicated about it . ; OK .
Bro014_1020	I mean , I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT ; and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad . ; Uh , so it would s ; and and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral , uh a s a smooth spectral envelope ,
Bmr003_973	I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , ; That 'd be so great . ; so ; Yeah .
Bro027_1302	some speech over it . ; And the other two are rather stationary also . ; Well , I I think that if you run it ; Actually , you maybe you remember this .
Bro027_1535	And so . ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; It 's the transformation they 're estimating on
Bmr016_2046	Um , that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the " point five " , ; or or it 's not there , then we ; Mm - hmm . ; a Just an And actually for things like " seven eighths " , or
Bed012_643	Four . ; Those are The bottom things are inputs , also . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah .
Bro019_311	So , ; I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro023_472	I 'm sorry about it . ; But the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six . ; This was again using ten frames of noise estimate and two stage of Wiener filtering . ; And the rest is like the LDA plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .
Bmr026_809	Oh I mean ; Yeah . ; Well ; Right .
Bro021_1102	And that 's where it comes from . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Right . ; Right .
Bro005_167	because never help to increase the accuracy . ; Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , ; the huge table , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1673	where , uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before , ; uh . ; Having people read digit strings ; That was Morgan .
Bmr027_1086	The problem with terminology . ; Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . ; But really it 's " QS in advance " . ; I mean , I I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings .
Bmr031_467	Well , someone 's gonna have to downsample . ; But then they 're just they 're just there 's just deferring the problem to later ; Yeah . ; and they might save themselves a lot of disk space problems by doing it right away .
Bed013_1059	like Srini , sort of hand parsed , ; hand crafted , ; but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances , and from ontologies , ; and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces , in terms of output .
Bro017_548	Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with ; because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_1042	And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers . ; Going in and out the portals and con ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bmr022_1471	Right ? ; I think we 're already gonna I mean there 's already some chance that different annotations , different places , you know ; But you can control that by knowing you 're making two corpora ; or knowing that you 're adding um , annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point .
Bro023_621	And you get ; you can do that ; I mean , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise ; or if you have a w voice activity detector , uh , you estimate the noise spectrum .
Bmr012_1361	When we do this in the key in the key in the key it has to indicate that channel change , ; Does it mess up the forms ? ; right ? ; Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that ,
Buw001_2205	So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? ; Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ? ; I really liked that . ; Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things
Bro012_1140	It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency ; and . ; So there would be more , ; Yeah .
Buw001_534	And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? " ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And then they would say " well , we talked about this
Bro014_126	Mm - hmm . ; But , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; um , but it 's so much faster .
Bro017_159	And they 're the staying the same ? ; So ; Well , of course people will not like it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_118	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_489	So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh on say digits , ; Mmm . ; On TI - digits ? ; OK .
Bro024_555	But the baseline mel cepstrum under those training doesn't do as well ; I I 'm I 'm trying to understand why it 's it 's eighty percent ; That 's an accuracy number , I guess , ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro003_1155	More . ; For the Italian , ; yes . ; Maybe one day .
Bed017_661	Well , if you fal solve the problem , hope you can do one for us too . ; Alright , was there anything else for this ? ; One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal . ; Yeah . I 'm sure .
Bmr016_1218	and so if we know that " CUZ " ; Well , ; That 's fine . ; Well Don has a script .
Bmr007_432	See , I mean , i i le let me t ; I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? " ; just never mind comparison with something else , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_580	Yeah . ; I would rather not mess with them until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently dealing with , ; Yeah , I 'm ; Right .
Bro010_943	i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . ; So , um , ; um , we don't really know how those should be labeled . ; It could sh be that you should , um , not be paying that much attention to , uh , certain bands for certain sounds , uh , in order to get the best result .
Bmr026_1054	Try it . ; You run it ? ; Keep keep both versions ? ; See which one 's better ?
Bmr005_564	Did Did you ; I 'm not sure eh by the moment , ; but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh ; for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh , eh eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting ,
Bro028_83	but it 's still sixty - one percent . ; Uh , and if we drop the tandem network , then we have fifty - seven percent . ; Uh , but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network ? ; Yeah .
Bro017_198	I see . ; So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective , ; right ? ; Right .
Bmr027_622	So we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . ; Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . ; Yeah . ; So far , two people have .
Bmr026_906	If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . ; I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_1070	Mm - hmm . ; And then , ; uh ; The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera ,
Bmr027_780	It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this ; and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved . ; Well , but we never also we 've also never done it . ; Hmm .
Bed006_1504	OK , so we can promote Enter - View all all up a bit ; and and get rid of the uh blah - blah - X - blah uh asterisk sub - action item altogether . ; OK . ; No no problem with that
Bns001_522	Barwan of uh ES ; Barwan . ; How 's it start ? ; I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz .
Btr002_2876	I agree . ; I did I did do one analysis wh where I looked at one meeting , ; That 's interesting . ; Uh - huh .
Bro003_248	So ; I mean , we ' r e e The bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue ; right ? ; Because e e this is downsampled and and filtered ,
Bmr029_146	But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive . ; No . It 's definitely It 's less than a hundred hours , for sure . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr019_249	It is wide - band . ; OK . ; and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling . ; Oh , that 's right .
Bdb001_1189	and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . ; So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . ; So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations . ; Yep .
Bed014_601	Um . ; But here 's here 's a way ; in th in the bl Bayes - net you could you could think about it this way , that if um at the time " admissions fee " was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter . ; Turn prior on .
Bmr028_1083	Oh , yeah . Then we should ; Yeah . So it 'd be cool to see if it helped . ; Well , first you have to filter the whole training set and retrain . ; Yeah .
Bro004_920	And then ; But but I didn't understand ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . the software currently just has uh a allows for I think , the one one hot output .
Bmr022_824	It doesn't even fit over my ear . ; Right . ; And for some of the others , it 's their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the ; Hmm .
Bmr015_194	Right . ; but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way . ; I mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way . ; The the problem also is she did want to stick with digits .
Bmr011_1753	OK . ; Oh , I don't know . ; yeah , what you said , cross - talk . ; All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , uh , techniques .
Bmr025_616	if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . ; Just just the monthly full . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear
Bns001_1274	because u you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet , using any application . ; And then this mechanism must fit it there . ; But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success , ; impossible to change .
Bed003_40	OK . ; I 'm sorry I ; Well , I mean , just to ; OK .
Bed002_866	And you see the label of the name ; So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , ; Mm - hmm . ; and we can change that .
Bmr012_571	Because it 's just gonna give us time marks ; Well we 've done that for one meeting . ; But you know ; so .
Bmr012_181	um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , ; up to synch time of one two zero zero ; so is that that 's twenty minutes or so ? ; Um yeah because I guess there 's some ,
Bmr009_919	So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi with reference to this . ; So the digit form , ; we had one already . ; Now the f the fields are slightly different .
Bro010_759	Yeah . ; So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , ; right ? ; Is they 're
Bmr013_646	It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , ; so . ; But I 'm not sure about how much . ; OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ?
Bmr024_97	So . ; And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also . ; I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? ; OK .
Bro012_1246	the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced , ; Mm - hmm . ; where w we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything . ; But we what we
Bed013_398	Which is not too good . ; Might be more interesting to do something like let 's assume um , we 're right , ; we have as Jerry calls it , a delusion of adequacy , ; and take a " where is X " sentence ,
Bed008_525	Uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . ; Could we just move it like this ? ; No no , I don't want the link there at all . ; Oh , OK .
Bns001_1026	It 's too late , I believe . ; If WAP was available in the beginning of GSM , then I think it was there would be a good chance that it is well - deployed . ; Mm - hmm . ; But now , the first generation of web - browsers are in the ha and and uh I would say " handies " ,
Bmr029_68	I mean ; Well , do we have the do we have the processed data ? ; That that 's also ; No . He has to create that .
Bmr024_482	So , it 's basically ; s ; I think , eight meetings or something which which I 'm using , ; and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting .
Bro025_249	Wow . ; More than one second for sure . ; Um . ; Hmm .
Btr002_1534	but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that there 's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something . ; Expanded ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , yes .
Bro005_1062	And and and ; yeah . ; And because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the MLP doesn't help . ; So . I don't know .
Bns001_1286	or the same applies for MPLS , for instance , ; maybe they are only portions available , ; how to deal with that when the islands are not available ; and maybe nothing is available .
Bmr030_483	And so there 's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back . ; And I 've already given him three more to work on , ; OK . ; but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company .
Bed008_1030	hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something ; Good point , I don't I don't know how we 're going to t uh ; or ; Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model
Bmr014_916	Well I guess ; So so so ; Yeah . ; I 'm sorry
Bmr028_270	It looks like it ; Um ; Just hacking Dan 's code and m stepping through it . ; But , I think it 's close .
Bmr021_846	They won't ; they don't correspond one - to - one though . ; No , but they should be close , since this ; I mean the
Bmr020_1887	I mean , it 's the same problem as the lapel mike . ; Yeah . ; But ; Oh , interesting .
Bed003_934	it might be ; Did we w ; Yes , ; that 's not good .
Bro016_134	Hmm . ; or you point me to some files that you 've already calculated . ; Yeah . ; Alright .
Bro019_317	Yep . ; OK , ; sure ; Mmm .
Bmr009_1092	Oh , @ @ . OK . ; And and and Oregon and and Oregon and Washington are are Western , but they 're also Northern . ; Yeah . ; Of course , that 's very different from , like , Michigan , or
Bmr015_839	Um , ; Yeah . ; I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them ; Well , but yeah I don't think you can I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame ,
Bed005_1288	and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior . ; If you don't know anything else about a building , uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level , ; Right . ; which might be equal , or whatever it is .
Bmr005_1473	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And u I think routinely they would not do this . ; So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere
Bro008_125	yeah . ; And they used the main thing that that they used was spectral subtraction ? ; Or ; There is a couple pieces to it .
Bro023_1105	They have like ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah , ; th the just noise compensation technique is a variant of Wiener filtering ,
Bmr010_19	Well , I 'm I sent a couple of items . They 're they 're sort of practical . ; I thought somebody had . ; I don't know if you 're ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bmr011_564	Yeah . ; But I mean , uh , for optimum flexibility later you 'd want to save each channel . ; But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . ; Uh , oh , OK , I see .
Bmr003_2558	Uh - oh ! ; Uh - oh ! ; Does that it means it means it 's gonna explode . ; No .
Bmr023_787	We just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system . ; Hmm . ; And , for instance , uh , Dan @ @ Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , um , something like ten Gaussians per cluster ; You know , each each mixture has ten Gaussians
Bmr029_123	It 's it 's it 's just , ; uh , I don't know the remember the the number . ; We could only jus just do the male only ; OK .
Bmr016_1366	Cuz I haven't heard it . ; and so of course it picked up stuff like this , ; and she just didn't listen ; so she didn't know .
Bro021_837	well , it 's too clean ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz it 's a
Bdb001_1280	OK , then ; But they 've also ; Exactly . ; And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that .
Bmr018_832	Every meeting ! ; you know , they 're time - aligned , ; so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1733	Mmm . We know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of RAD . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I can't believe we 're using this term .
Bed014_396	Alright . ; Probably skipping the mental spaces part . ; Seems ; Right . I do .
Bed008_1390	So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys ; and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . ; So H produces some you know , it produces a number , ; either one , two , three , or four , in our situation ,
Bro026_610	Yeah , I guess . ; So these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or ; Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . ; Using our features .
Bed017_102	Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Cuz there is another Andreas around , ; Eh
Bro019_982	uh , looks like a worthy thing to to do here . ; Uh , yeah . ; But , yeah . ; But for sure there 's required to that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things
Bmr005_1182	Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use ; well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . ; There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription . ; So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ?
Bmr007_1184	I got that . ; Yeah . ; We we we spent a a a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e we realized , " well , people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later " , and , how do you get around that ; OK .
Bed011_998	OK . ; We are expecting Johno to build a parser , ; Uh , this is Yes . ; but that 's a
Bmr027_889	Yeah . ; So I i ; Yeah . I like VI . ; There 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like " powered by VI " .
Bns001_1519	Bless you . ; Bless you . ; Uh Anyway , but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available . ; The good thing is that the money is available ,
Bro003_139	I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase , ; Oh yeah . Yeah . ; yeah . ; That 's sort of one night .
Bmr016_1167	Did I ; I don't remember . ; OK . ; So so it might not have been It might not have been you ,
Bmr010_556	Huh . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Well , one would ; Yeah .
Bed013_1008	And , the discourse can maybe tell us w what 's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements . ; And so we can hard code " for opera , look for tickets , look for this , look for that , ; OK . ; OK .
Bro028_857	But I should read the paper . ; And that 's ; I just went through the poster quickly , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_134	So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yes , very true very true ; Yeah Yeah
Bmr014_27	What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to how to finish it up . ; OK . ; I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment . ; In particular , the
Bro010_150	and but this is a filter , ; so it has also a delay . ; Uh , ; and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds .
Bed017_91	Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy . ; Sorry . ; Yeah . ; Hi . Hi .
Bed011_57	Probably next week . ; But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . ; And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . ; So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here , and have them actually record like this .
Bns002_1572	After the meeting . ; Ah ! ; You will send it , sorry . ; I will .
Bed004_110	The reading was five minutes , exactly . ; And now comes the ; This is the phone - in phase of ; Wait , can I I have a question .
Bed011_1025	I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from sort of as general as argument structure constructions . ; Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . ; I have to do uh uh unbounded dependencies , ; you know , which have a variety of constructions in uh uh
Bro004_579	No , you don't have training on English testing ; There there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . ; Well , For for the Italian part I mean ; In in what ?
Bed012_320	Go - there and not - Go - there . ; Let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Info - on has True or False and Location .
Bmr024_807	Disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to , uh , get some more disk pretty soon . ; Do you wanna be a subject ? ; Yeah , I be pretty good . ; We
Bmr019_1988	Did you read it twice or what ? ; He 's try No , he 's trying to get good recognition performance . ; He had the h ; Yeah .
Bed002_974	Is it to go there , to see it , and ; To come as close as possible to it . ; Th - the terminology we 're using is to ; Yeah , it 's @ @ .
Bed006_1415	um that 's kind of a contentious point between the two of us ; but this is one wa so this is a way to link uh the way these roles are filled out to the action . ; In my view . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_805	I just at the moment don't know . ; Mm - hmm . ; H ; No .
Bed015_600	Y yeah . ; Yeah . ; But but bottom line , I agree with you , ; Yeah .
Bns003_636	Holidays ; Th ; yeah . ; Um , I am working now on on something ,
Bmr011_172	No , but my point is ; But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . ; R r right ; I I 'm not sure I 'm follow .
Bed011_504	and then , what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I mean i it seem that um there is a difference between going to see something , and things like " exchange money " or " dine out " ; Oh , absolutely .
Bmr029_166	No . I didn't do that , ; because we haven't even cut the waveforms for that . ; You didn't do that . OK . ; Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say next .
Bed010_34	The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . ; And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . ; So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now , ; so " synthesis " is where you sort of make this uh , make these sounds ,
Bmr011_852	and they mainly had to do with this , um , this , uh , tree structure , uh , annotated tree diagram thing . ; Mmm . ; So , um , um and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . ; Right .
Bmr028_505	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , oh . I see . OK . Fine . ; Well , SRI people , easy to f find .
Bns002_1553	I don't know who he is . ; OK . ; Then , of course , the whole N S A group ; and also of the coordinator of all the things ,
Bmr030_411	But now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out . ; Yeah . So the only difference would be , we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM . ; Then maybe it would be OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_244	If I were to be dictating a phone number , I would have done that more slowly , ; but uh which would have been easier for the of course , for the machine . ; But . Was that an OK pace ? ; Sure .
Bmr010_693	Right . ; So it 's it 's , uh , uh ; Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little form . ; But it does happen .
Bmr008_577	And then they they could s ; Right yeah , they could say it different ways . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1018	It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved ; because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1692	Is that all all of them are based on all the others , ; right ? ; Just , you you can't say ; Right .
Btr001_2395	Hmm . ; Meaning , " Let 's keep going " ? ; Maybe it means that . ; Well ,
Bed014_472	The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . ; One of them was th ; Right . ; or comes
Bro012_559	Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; For the moment , they are working on integrating the um spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson .
Bmr022_1208	And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker , ; and didn't get mentioned in the " key " file , ; but they were only there for a second , ; but it 's t useful to mention that they were there .
Bmr027_117	That 's right . ; I just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine . ; Right . I mean , that 's fine . ; OK , good .
Bro003_1672	so we may as well just do on - line normalization . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing .
Bmr011_431	He needs to uh , leave for uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight ; Oh , so just morning . ; from from Oakland . ; Right .
Bmr007_361	It depends what you 're doing . ; So if you were actually having , ; uh ; depends what you 're doing ,
Bro005_81	so , it 's multi - English , ; we have a ninety - one number , ; Mm - hmm . ; and training with other languages is a little bit worse .
Bmr031_379	Can't we downsample ; and , uh , transcribe on that basis ? ; That would be the hope . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_173	Hiccups . ; Yeah ? ; or ; Yeah .
Buw001_316	But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , I see . ; I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said .
Bro025_463	But nobody seems to have cared about that in this evaluation . ; And that way the net could use ; So . ; If the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames .
Bed016_381	um , ; and may not , ; but you might wanna this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the ; anal
Bro014_1215	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that 's driving some filters . ; This is the the auto - correlation the R - zero energy .
Btr001_2236	like uh , um , " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Like a sort of an inad ; Of course
Bro024_932	like like a spectral subtraction ; or ; No their filter is not M domain . ; Yeah .
Bro019_288	so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something . ; You probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . ; Yeah . Right ? ; Hmm ?
Bmr020_80	Gee ! Here we all are ! ; Uh , ; so the only agenda items were Jane was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM transcription process . ; There 's an agenda ?
Bed003_1133	it allows you enter things well . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; But if th if there is an XML file that or format that it can also read
Bed014_1052	Why do I have this unless I 'm gonna write ? ; do I get to see th uh , your formalism before that ? ; Fine . ; Yes .
Bmr016_2173	So I I thought we we sh we sh perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions ; just to just to try it . ; Give it Give one tr transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech - nonspeech detection ; and look if if that 's helpful for them ,
Bmr027_212	If someone says " hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ? ; We have to remove it . ; Well . That 's true . ; I I agree with that part ,
Bed014_837	It it might even be interesting then to say that I should be forced to um , sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the , uh out of the top hat ; Yes . ; and , um ; Always good .
Bmr023_959	So . ; I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either , ; so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1519	so we 're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between , uh primarily between this project and the Meetings Meetings Project . ; Um . ; But , uh , ; we 've put another I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch .
Bro027_358	Right . ; Uh ; But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually , ; but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features .
Bed013_286	Well we fixed some more things from the SmartKom system , ; but that 's not really of general interest , ; Um , ; Oh ! Questions ,
Bro021_955	I mean , just never mind what they are . ; Uh , it 's just if X and N are variables ; Right ? ; What is , uh ?
Bed009_1123	Yeah , ; just about the um ; oh yeah , ; I see ,
Bmr019_294	So , uh ; it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker . ; Right . So we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent . ; Right .
Bmr003_331	Hear the difference ? ; Oh , that 's better . ; Yeah , it 's great . ; Oh , it 's enormous .
Bmr010_765	Good . ; but not too far away . ; Yeah , i ; And then , you know , I think there 's not much
Bmr021_902	So . ; For for whatever that 's worth . ; Oh , you tried that on Broadcast News ? ; Oh yeah .
Bro026_1054	I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit ; I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , ; but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . ; You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ?
Btr002_2792	when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent . ; I have more false starts and things . ; Really ? ; Yeah .
Bmr006_771	eh . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , ; but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . ; You need truth . Hmm . ; Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with .
Bmr003_992	It 's pretty cute . ; OK . ; But at any rate . ; It 's Perl script .
Bro027_829	And ; Um . ; So . There is a f a first feature stream that use uh straight MFCC features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_80	And he gave the example in his talk about how um , ; e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , ; but it 's something about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know , " John had washed the floor " or something like that . ; And I don't have it quite right ,
Bmr020_1842	So , the part where they 're using sounds from their from their laptops . ; With ; with the laptop sound , ; or ?
Btr002_2263	Right . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; It sounds like it 's a nice smooth melody ,
Bmr016_46	yeah . ; And you think we th uh , ; I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , ; but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ?
Bed009_147	I was just thinking I w I will have leavened by eleven . ; Right . Right . ; This is then out of deference to our non - morning people . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1307	and uh then you only use for this one distinction . ; Alright . ; And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases , ; and you 've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side .
Bed015_494	You could build up an appropriately uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Hmm ,
Bro027_1499	Um . No . ; That 's what that 's what we 're gonna do next ; as soon as I finish this other thing . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1167	I 'm sorry , ; ru running on what machine ? ; Uh , Ravioli . ; Uh ,
Btr002_1992	discourse c aspect , ; the mixed channel is artificial ; because we 're boosting it in order to make everything audible . ; Yeah .
Bro007_184	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's it 's it 's a little slightly simpler . ; Yeah . ; So so there 's so I I would put that one also as a as a maybe .
Btr002_3154	Just not useful ? ; Yeah , you can't really spell those things with the R with the Roman alphabet , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ?
Bro011_695	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Doesn't have to go down . ; I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet ,
Bro011_661	So in fact what we may want are simpler models . ; Could be . ; And compare how they perform to that . ; But you know , it depends on what the actual application is
Bro011_280	I wonder who else is ; I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . ; Um . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . ; So uh this is especially true for the lapel
Bed014_1353	that 's , you know , I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done . ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . We actually have I think we have been making progress ,
Bns001_1291	because I have a mobile phone , a mobile node or whatever kind of device , ; and I want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet . ; So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with . ; I always say that the success of internet make it unflexible .
Bro027_1842	Um , ; well . We w we don't have it , actually , ; because it 's it has a high rate energy ; No .
Bmr020_813	They 're all downsampled , ; yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Oh that 's th important to know ,
Bmr027_1097	It 's just totally understanda ; This is this is a lot of jargon . ; Um , and the final one , ; the transcriber had th " in the core network itself
Bmr029_523	Yeah . ; And that ; I don't know if we ; we never really
Bed017_341	Well that 's the that would that would be a uh , you could sell it , as a ; Yeah . ; OK , eh you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the ; And then you can blame the computer .
Bro028_525	What kind of numbers are they getting on these on the test conditions ? ; Well , see , I was a little confused ; because on this table , I 'm the they 're showing word error rate . ; But on this one ,
Bmr030_281	I should email Morgan about it too , ; because he was asking about that . ; And Yeah . ; I mean , so , there 's obviously a trade - off between the number of knots y you pick , and the best fit .
Bro016_528	You 'd really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all , ; maybe just some white noise or something like that a at most . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that 's not really what this contest is .
Bro027_42	And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too . ; Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at OGI . ; Um , ; but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass .
Bro025_668	but but , uh , seeing if you cou but , um noise estimation could be improved . ; Mm - hmm . ; Those are sort of related issues . ; It probably makes sense to move from there .
Bro008_55	yeah . ; Well , that would be good . ; That 'd be good . ; Yeah .
Bed008_892	Right . ; so ; Right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , ; so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not
Bed015_1641	Um , ; Really ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; You 're kidding .
Bmr009_1161	We can make up our own ; So we can say " Northwest " , " Rest of West " or something . ; You know . ; " West "
Bro028_845	Um , I think this i ; You know , I don't remember that . ; Do you remember ? ; I think they have , yeah , different histograms .
Bed004_196	Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but ; Yeah , that 's so @ @ . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr006_203	Well ; Oh . ; But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that ; I see .
Bmr006_312	and that 's OK too . ; Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? ; I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , ; that 's why we did it .
Bed004_760	Um . ; I ; i This this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work . ; So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more .
Bmr026_740	I don't . ; Let 's read digits and go . ; Why don't we just start with that . ; ummh . ummh . OK .
Bed017_309	So , we 'll actually figure all this out . ; OK . ; OK . ; Then I think the w long term perspective is is pretty clear .
Btr001_669	you know . ; In the prev ; You 've also gone through ; They 've been here since the beginning .
Bmr006_1602	but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . ; I 've no desire to to make it up , ; but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_887	Um , ; and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , um , " I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . " ; Mm - hmm . ; And you initialize these parameters , um , in some some way
Bro022_673	OK , ; good . ; So they are helping . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_191	Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have ; I ; Uh , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . ; If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model ,
Bmr007_427	Well , there is a high rate , ; So . ; It 's but I don't know how high , in fact ; Well , here I have a question .
Bed002_461	we can mem model all of that ; and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . ; That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding . ; Yeah . S so so the way that might come up , if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , " Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? "
Bro027_1068	You know . ; What are the S N Rs in the training set , TIMIT ? ; It 's , uh , ranging from zero to clean ? ; Yeah .
Bro024_726	So the major improvement that we got was in all the high mismatch cases , ; because all those numbers were in sixties and seventies ; because we never had any noise compensations . ; Mmm .
Bns001_1067	It i it is . ; In in in Sweden it is also there . ; And in the Netherlands , it is also available . ; Mmm .
Bns002_1194	Yeah . ; Does it still apply for for the uh eleven - B ? ; For the ; no .
Bmr005_37	Yeah , well , that 's ; Um , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion . ; Uh , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points ; and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way
Bmr018_482	Well , I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure , ; Yeah . ; and have them starting with mixed ; OK .
Bmr005_1132	noise . ; So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . ; It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , ; Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos .
Bmr009_247	Yeah . ; And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved , you know , or or or worsened by the looking at regular energy , looking at log energy , ; we were just proposing that maybe it 's you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_370	Good . ; Yeah I mean , for the for the um acoustic research , ; for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start . ; But , th I mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data ,
Bmr019_1168	I 've heard " burst " also . ; uh , this this is just maybe someone has s some some ideas about how to do it better , ; Mmm . ; but we So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels .
Btr001_2137	One thing that I I 'm you probably don't remember this that I was really interested in is the use of " so " and the use of " or " . ; Because the way people use it in these meetings , I found , was ; I don't know if it was it if it 's different than other people . ; I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing .
Bmr019_838	So I think you do have ; if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . ; But it 'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your Waves stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_587	Mm - hmm . ; You were y no ; Except except Prashant ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_841	Mm - hmm . ; We don't care what what tool you use . ; Yeah . I mean , if if you can , um if you wanna ; OK .
Bed017_364	in in the interim . ; Good . Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . ; Or Andy , for that matter ? ; OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all .
Bmr024_1449	Could be . ; Yeah . ; And so , w so , just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_646	Basically . ; No that 's not a problem . ; I L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_153	Mmm . ; Yes , absolutely . ; if if we can figure out a way to do it . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_131	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's non - threatening , ; I mean , this this compared to , you know , wh exactly what level of professorship , and and ; Yep .
Bmr018_428	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly . ; Oh , really ?
Bmr010_1035	Hmm . ; Where were they when we needed them ? ; I think ; We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything .
Bmr025_447	OK . ; yeah . ; Seat ? ; Great .
Bmr003_739	Well I thought you just that 's said that was a critical issue . ; No , ; We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . ; uh the the boundary
Bmr030_648	Wonder if the ones before that were shortened . ; Yeah . ; The beep files , actually the " shorten " doesn't save a whole lot . ; Right ?
Bmr012_592	Right , right . ; It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , ; if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK ; but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good .
Bmr005_652	I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption , ; No , it 's ; you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or ; Right .
Bro003_1491	We 're over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place , ; Mm - hmm . ; but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines . ; And we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster .
Bro023_165	by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back ; because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component .
Bed006_1233	Well one of the types of action schemas is Source - Path - Goal action . ; And what are some types of that ? ; And an Enter , a View , an Approach . ; Right .
Bmr026_810	Yeah . ; Well ; Right . ; So , we cou
Bro016_684	So , um . ; Y you could imagine that ; I mean , just like we 're saying voiced - unvoiced is good to know ; uh , male female is good to know also .
Bmr012_902	Thank God it 's not more than that . ; So ; Is eight kilohertz is is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ? ; Yeah .
Bed002_1350	Yep . ; OK . We can end the meeting ; and call Adam , ; and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg .
Bmr023_772	which means that , um ; Uh - huh . ; But , you know , it didn't change th the ; by adjusting that the , um
Bed015_1162	Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . ; And just a note , ; which was that , um ; s so when we actually ha
Bmr026_780	I mean definitely not significant . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .
Bmr012_732	um I don't know who , I mean how this was done ; but is is there are there any um issues with downsampling ; Don did this . ; because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly
Bro011_748	Uh , Octave ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah it 's it 's it 's free . ; I think we have it here r running somewhere .
Bmr020_1545	Oops . ; Um ; Hmm ! ; Let me think .
Bed004_455	then you could say " Aha , let 's have these three factors " , ; OK ? ; and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one . ; Mmm .
Bro010_215	Uh , which is we say , well this is the way we should do it . ; And then we do it . ; And then someone else does something that 's straight forward . ; So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise
Bro014_101	even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster . ; And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's ; And when you have your final thing , we go back to this . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1823	Oh , shoot . ; Here it is three - fifteen already . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_442	The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which ; Ah . ; Oh in ; it 's been recorded ,
Bmr022_566	Right . ; so we 're gonna have to have some kind of ; Yeah , then we just map it to a reject model . ; In and in fact , that 's what we do now .
Bmr014_992	And and I ha ; I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . ; Yeah . ; I mean I I thought that you were
Bed011_1079	OK . ; But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of uh of analysis , ; you know , these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the " Out of " construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something . ; Correct .
Bmr028_1194	Which version of the transcripts . ; Right . They 're somewhere in between January and late March , or something like that ? ; Yeah . Something around there . ; OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell .
Bed008_1054	But ; because I want to do a little bit of organization . ; Before we get more into details . ; The organization is going to be that uh
Bdb001_226	and with for every frame , ; You don't want to do it with that ; um ; Anything at frame - level you had better encode binary
Bro018_975	I was wondering if there 's maybe um certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum . ; So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code ; but produce mel cepstrum ; and compare that directly to
Bro019_1029	Yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; Yeah . ; I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that .
Bro011_227	we have not make the experiment ; Oh . ; and ; OK .
Bmr010_669	And then , uh ; just in terms of how you wear them ; I mean , I had thought about this before . ; I mean , when when when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on .
Bro023_1743	we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try ; like , um , the spectral slope , the , um , the degree o degree of voicing with the features that , uh , we started to develop with Carmen , um , e with , uh , the correlation between bands and different kind of features , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1444	but I can't ; because ; Cuz you end up missing entire frames . ; it skips . Yeah .
Bro014_225	Do you know who was who was since we weren't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from OGI ? ; Was was was Hynek involved ; or was it Sunil ; I have no idea .
Bmr026_909	Mm - hmm . ; So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with . ; Once we know , then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_94	yeah , so we might actually , ; um ; S i Jane may say that , " you know , you can't do this " , ; uh , " on the same form , we need a separate form . "
Bdb001_1304	So so imagine ; I think his his example is a good one . ; Imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1024	Absinthe . ; Absinthe . ; Well , you know , that 's ; We 've got five processors on that .
Btr002_219	Yeah , I would just sort of end it . ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm . ; But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , new word , like capitalized " So " .
Bed014_1229	That - that 's not that 's not saying it 's bad , ; it 's just that ; Right . Right . No . Of course . ; Mmm .
Bmr009_1514	Oh yeah . ; So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough . ; Yeah . ; It doesn't display the others .
Bed010_827	So " OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; It it follows .
Bro019_1161	Uh - huh . ; To to ; To ; The idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound .
Bmr008_1090	And this would and and we discussed this , ; this is with reference to like the DTD , ; what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific . ; So . And it could be something like , " oh by the way , the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know ,
Btr002_2847	Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that 's n unnatural and forced . ; Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says their little schpiel ; Yeah . ; and people are meant to be , you know , pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part .
Bro028_305	eh ; There 's two problems there . ; I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr019_414	the near versus far . ; And , yeah , the adaptation would get th some of that . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , I think even even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like I was saying in the email , I think that 's that 's a big factor .
Buw001_431	Yeah . ; Those aren't the kind of things that come up . ; But at least it would get us started . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr031_931	They got a lot of vaca ; Long vacations . ; Right . Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr022_944	Yeah . ; it 'd be really great , I think , if we can argue t that ; It 's an interesting idea . ; people like that .
Bmr002_630	I didn't think to bring it . ; Ha - Have you looked at it already ? ; Oh , I have , ; but I wasn't interested in that particular issue .
Bmr028_1040	uh , before you do the clustering to rule out those those types of things . ; Or to just do the clustering , knowing that you 're capturing both . ; It 's just that the kind of clustering we 've done before hasn't had that , uh , distance factor , or location factor in it in the same way . ; I see .
Bed011_76	Yeah . ; Um you can look at this if you want , ; these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . ; Any comments I can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .
Bmr028_107	And it displays it at ; Yeah . Did it ? ; And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . ; So there 's a little user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution .
Bro014_497	Um . ; But ; I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1500	and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do
Bmr020_984	That 's fine . ; OK . ; But what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends um are actually close to the speech inside of that ; Yeah ,
Bmr016_26	Well , OK . ; and uh pick out the ones that have problems , ; and either correct them or have them re - read . ; So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set .
Bmr028_225	But it 's you know , it it 's ; That 's true . We could just subset it . ; Yeah . ; That 's a good idea .
Bmr003_504	whatever that means . ; Super . ; Great . ; Yeah , that I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area ,
Bro011_365	And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . ; So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use ; and do you combine them using the soft " AND - OR " or you do something , you know , more complicated ; um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ?
Bmr018_1128	but ; the HLT paper is really more of a introduction - to - the - project paper , and , um ; Yeah . ; Yeah , for Eurospeech we want some results
Bsr001_465	I mean , you won't be able to show any results . ; Mmm . ; So . ; Oh , right , right , right .
Bro003_346	if ; Yeah . ; If it 's th in the phone , ; but
Bed003_652	OK . ; fifty per " Like , you know . ; So obviously that 's gonna happen . ; Right .
Bmr016_53	and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . ; I have this web - based speaker form , ; and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , ; and they 're slowly s trickling in .
Btr002_3275	Mm - hmm . ; Initials ? ; That 's that 's I did that partly to keep track of things . ; Absolutely .
Bro028_4	So ne next week we 'll have , uh , both Birger and , uh , Mike Michael ; Michael Kleinschmidt ; Uh - huh . ; and Birger Kollmeier will join us .
Bmr009_1545	I mean . ; Yeah . ; That might be faster . ; Right ?
Bmr003_1237	Yeah . ; OK . ; You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave . ; Oh ,
Bed014_409	Right . ; There 's The group as a whole knows ; but no individual member kno ; Well that that yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document , right ? ,
Bmr008_1119	but just like I said , if there 's a k a certain topic that comes up in the meeting , and that knowing their relationship will clarify it , or if there 's a certain dynamic that comes up ; So , I mean , a person is asked a whole bunch of questions , more than you 'd usually think they 'd be asked , ; and it turns out it 's because he 's being prepared for a job interview or something like that , then it 's useful to know that that relationship . ; Right .
Bro024_274	So if someone 's interacting with the system , though , uh , Morgan uh , Morgan said that you would tend to , um , chain utterances together ; um , r ; Well , I think what I was s I thought what I was saying was that , um , at any given point you are gonna start off with what you had from before . ; Oh .
Bmr022_916	Yes . ; Or what do they ; Yep . ; They wear the heads
Btr001_1664	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Well , i it 's a judgment call .
Bmr001_315	And you know we have this this idea of the handshake back and forth and say " I 'm here , I 'm here " ; Yeah . ; Right . ; " We 're now an array . "
Btr002_1375	But , um , ; yeah . ; One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything . ; Hmm .
Bed009_170	Yeah obviously . ; um um Not this type of data , ; no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such ; Oh , OK .
Bmr014_1144	And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . ; Mm - hmm . ; What it comes down to but ; Yeah I think actually
Bro027_1367	Yeah . ; Um , ; Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . ; Yeah .
Bns003_927	maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home ; there 's some linkage ; and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area , uh , with the supported , um , home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area . ; The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one .
Bmr011_1072	right ? ; No , we used the fact that ; So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , ; It 's already chunked .
Bmr016_1753	But at some point I mean , we probably shoul ; We 'll probably add it to the language model . ; But we should add it to the dictionar ; No , to the pronunciation model .
Bmr015_212	and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that sort of chunking . ; She 's right . It 's it it 's a different problem . ; I mean it 's a it 's a it 's an interesting problem ; I mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before ,
Bmr019_358	Oh . ; Oh . ; Right ? ; Then , eh because you you don't have any
Bmr011_1253	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's still ; Yeah . ; some sort of categories
Bmr025_1048	Well OK , so let 's do one of those simultaneous ones . ; so we might n we might need to do that actually . ; OK . ; That sounds good .
Bmr019_657	Uh - huh . ; Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , ; but instead you have sort of feature file segments . ; But , you know
Bmr002_1377	None of the rest of us have . ; And so we could have wired mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal . ; Oh . ; Oh , I see .
Bed013_231	but if we have to do it two to the twenty times , then that 's a very very large number . ; Right . ; Argh . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr024_1558	Oh , OK . ; Yeah , we 'll just go buy them , I guess . ; And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz . ; Yeah .
Bro005_587	Mm - hmm . ; but you say what those variances are . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , that you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gonna it 's gonna it 's gonna internally multiply it and and uh , uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's it 's gonna it 's it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the change the variances of some of the features .
Bed002_788	So you actually see that . ; Um . The uh , ; um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . ; So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth .
Bro023_932	Is that the log ? ; Um , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ? ; After that . ; No ,
Bed004_493	and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you , ; uh throw the die for you , ; because um I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing . ; Close this down .
Bro003_1457	Right , ; right . ; And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_367	And uh , that was ; uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA . ; And uh , ; so then after after that I I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that .
Bed010_1085	Pretty soon . ; OK . ; OK , so I guess that 's ; So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .
Bro016_801	at the log , perhaps , ; and ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_741	Um , in his previous Aurora experiments . ; And with the net it 's it 's wonderful . ; Without the net it 's just baseline . ; Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too .
Bns001_130	Yeah , we m discussed it yesterday that you 'll maybe will have a talk next Tuesday ; Y ; Yeah . ; But , Give me a sign and send me an abstract so that I can announce it , then , for the next meeting .
Bed002_1033	uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , ; cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d ; You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . ; d w
Btr001_925	I it it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly . ; There was an adjustment , ; and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that ; OK .
Bmr008_1638	but those are close enough to the ; You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there 's overlap then you should do quite well there . ; Uh - huh . ; Mmm .
Bro018_258	Um , if you 're getting fifty - six percent over here , ; uh that 's in noise also , ; right ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Btr002_857	And that I would it would crack a lot . ; Yeah . Ooh ! ; It was very weird . ; Mmm .
Bro014_786	So , yeah . ; Uh . ; Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay . ; Then we tried , um , to do something like proposal - two
Bmr028_1079	Mm - hmm . ; Um , and the other thing This would kind of be a Hail Mary , ; but but , uh Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits , ; and , you know , and so with then it 'd be , you know , just throw that in and see .
Bro021_1332	or I I guess we 're gonna be given even better boundaries than that . ; And you look you take all o all of the nonspeech components in an utterance , ; so you have a fair amount . ; Do you benefit from having a better model for the noise ?
Bro012_447	Hey Morgan ? ; Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi ? ; Is that still valid ? ; I I 've been using that .
Bns001_322	And you see the benefit that , in principle , the customer will save a lot of money . ; Because if in - house communication like WaveLAN or maybe I see it also in the American market , some WaveLAN communication in the outer world will be available , the m and that is your assumption , that the more cost uh extensive um U M T S connection could be principle used , I would like to say , over WaveLAN , ; and then I have a normal WaveLAN connection , right ? ; Yes .
Bro026_574	Yeah , yeah . ; Do we already have it ? ; Yeah , th I I guess it 's almost ready . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_817	Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special . ; Right . Exactly . ; So . I mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_614	Mm - hmm . ; I have a reference for that though . ; Oh you do . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_641	There 's actually uh there 's this a former student of here from Berkeley , ; Nigel Nigel Ward . ; Do you know him ? ; Uh - huh .
Bmr008_1351	This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing . ; Uh - huh . ; And then the other thing I 'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1498	And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . ; We could s ; I really do think that , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2451	M that sorta thing . ; Uh ; That 's right , ; this we could each make up a string .
Btr001_1811	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Huh . ; Huh .
Bro025_312	Yeah . ; Um . ; Mmm . ; So Yeah , I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay .
Bmr029_108	Oh , I see . ; But - m How big is the small training set ? ; Do you remember ? ; Hmm . Uh .
Bns003_853	Now as I see , in principle , uh fff that 's a really raw view . ; MPLS offers certain kind of success of active routing , ; because in principle , the forwarding pass is a little bit decoupled from this from the routing pass , ; Yeah .
Btr002_2531	Hmm ! ; Oh . ; Well , now , y This is a good question . ; I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen " hmph " in literature meaning in
Bro021_996	That doesn't follow . ; Well , we can put , uh , this ? ; Mmm . ; No .
Bmr027_769	It wouldn't work . ; The speech recognizer still works . ; Yeah . And if you do it backward then ; Yeah .
Bed016_1026	Um . ; I mean , there 's also things like I mean , s ; um , ; I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah "
Bed013_1021	Yeah . ; You know . That becomes part of like , their sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , um , over in your Bayes - net or whatever , when when the person says " where is it " , you 've already got , you know since they were talking about admission , and that evokes the idea of entering , um , then when they go and ask " where is it " , then you 're Enter node is already active
Bro014_1464	middle June ? ; I don't know ; w ; Hmm .
Bmr016_334	so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , ; Yeah . ; Yeah all we have for some people is digits . ; Yeah .
Bro012_663	So . ; Good . ; That 's cool . ; And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here ,
Bmr015_615	which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1356	They just ; No . ; In neither case . ; And I 'm and I 'm thinking I 'm thinking you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got
Buw001_1737	cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up ; Good . ; and so on , your your page on that . ; Oh , excellent . Good .
Bmr028_1177	So , when you 're d running things , if you run it on the old ; So . If you if you run it on the new version , then the numbers will be um , and you compare it to the to runs on the old version , then you 're gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case . ; Hmm . ; Different .
Btr001_1387	or is it that they have several people doing it together ? ; You know , maybe it 's parallel . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr030_591	Yeah , yeah . ; That 's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could , ; but ; It 's just another
Bed009_432	Mm - hmm . ; So , if it 's only like in in the in the film and T V thing , ; OK , you can do this . ; And you just get information and give it to people .
Bmr020_1741	And we have any number of channels available , ; Uh - huh . ; I mean it 's an infinite number of channels . ; Yeah .
Bro022_816	So ; I mean , with some pauses in the center , ; provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . ; Yeah .
Bro005_721	Mm - hmm . ; uh , much as I said with JRASTA , ; even though I really like JRASTA ; and I really like MSG ,
Bro013_84	I mean so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . ; So it 's ; Yeah . ; I mean . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end .
Bmr008_421	I I don't think it matters . ; If it makes you more comfortable , put Optional ; It It I think it 's better to put " Optional " . ; I I don't think it 's
Bmr008_1587	Uh - huh . ; For b for both , for eh the frame energy and eh residular LPC eh energy too . ; Uh , for both , ; yeah .
Bro004_234	Yeah . ; you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three . ; Ye ; That 's what you were just saying , I think .
Bed013_340	I will try to work on the SmartKom stuff ; and I 'll if I can finish it today , I 'll help you with that tomorrow , ; if you work on it ? ; I don't have a problem with us working on it though ?
Bsr001_206	you you 're going to be you 're going to be saying , you know , funnier things , ; This is a very sensual thing . ; Yeah , ; I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up .
Bmr006_180	And if people want to approach ; Um , ; i so I know e e You know this ; The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,
Bdb001_529	Right . ; but ; I mean , I like this . ; This is sort of intuitively easy to actually r read ,
Btr002_1858	s so ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; " Whee - whee " . is what he said .
Bns002_1438	So , if we are going to offer building blocks , and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks , taking into account , without modifying the end - to - end scope , then I think it 's really beneficial work , ; also for the use of interactive multimedia application , ; so as it is described in the uh project proposal . ; Um the point is that um to start with um a bigger cluster of co uh of potential partners to do this really really really big work ,
Bro023_934	After that . ; No , ; after . ; Right .
Bro021_608	And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase ; because that will undo that . ; Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all . ; Hmm .
Bro016_574	We we ; Social security number ; That would be good . ; Like , we have male , female ,
Bmr019_367	Yeah . So that 'd be anoth another interesting data point . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I I guess I 'm saying I don't know if we 'd want to do that as the as ; Other way .
Bed004_567	Hmm . ; I whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1177	Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ? ; Three Three hours . ; Yeah . ; I mean , is there
Bed014_128	Better . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sure . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1471	Or or maybe not even a second , ; maybe a quarter of a second or something , ; so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length ; Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds
Bro017_961	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , the sharper the variance , the more more important to get that one right .
Bro024_789	And if it is noisy it is somewhere here . ; And then you try to subtract it or Wiener filter or whatever . ; And what you get is you have always these problems , that you have this these these these zeros in there . ; Yeah .
Bed015_861	Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; But figure out how the ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1627	Yeah . ; But I think I th Again , I think that sort of that that would be good , ; and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further . ; Yeah .
Bro026_975	Mm - hmm . ; You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our ; correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_108	But mobile network this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer , ; especially because uh , until not so long uh , the the things were too heavy to have a computer , a wireless transceiver , on a more or less portable thing . ; So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing , in the market . ; And , eh , well this is more or less what I have done .
Bed006_1122	and so uh uh I mean y you really have to focus on on on ; Right . ; and decide the level of of abstraction that that you aim at it kind of zero in on that , ; Right .
Bro018_1239	Uh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Thank you . ; Yep .
Bed011_995	Right , but we 're not expecting Keith to actually build a parser . ; No , no , no , no , no . ; Right , Right . ; OK .
Bmr028_1128	OK . ; Wow . Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_720	it 's just whether or not the , um , the segments that were all synchronized , whether there was some overlap somewhere . ; c High correlation . ; And , you know , that pointed out some differences , ; so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward .
Bed011_157	David and and Jane and and Lila are working on that as we speak . ; OK . ; OK . ; That was the uh the data collection in a nutshell .
Bro022_562	it might be worse if the channel is constant , ; Yeah . ; or ; Nnn .
Bed016_931	let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . ; So let 's first do a ; So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest ; and a and actually the
Bro014_41	Great ! ; Was it last week or whenever ? ; Um , ; so what I was started playing with was the th again , this is the HTK back - end .
Bmr027_446	We do it like with these ; That was something that was sort of just within our implementation . ; We can use it we can use a a ploy ; OK .
Bmr020_1846	w If we have speech from the laptop should we just uh , excise that from what we send to IBM , ; just ; or should we i give it to them and let them do with it what they can ? ; I think we should just
Bed008_1446	Yeah . ; Yes . ; So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . ; Oh yeah .
Bed006_1403	I can guarantee that . ; And it 's gonna get more and more complex the the l complexer and larger our domains get . ; Sigh . ; And I think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon .
Bsr001_617	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; What 's your project ? ; Well , basically , the the the original project looks a lot like , you know , the the p your project .
Bmr024_754	O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . ; All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . ; Right . ; And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings .
Bro023_504	Uh - huh . ; And they filter the original signal using that fil filter , ; which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up . ; So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice ,
Bmr003_1486	I 'll be right back . ; I transcribed a minute of this stuff ; I see . ; and there was a lot of overlapping .
Bmr030_776	Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year . ; OK . ; Like when we get around a hundred meetings . ; OK .
Bmr018_1607	But , I think one of their p They they had a couple points . ; w Uh , I think one of them was that " Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are is better " . ; Less memory , ; faster operation ,
Btr002_3109	Yeah . ; But it was very quiet . ; So I can see how that would have been sort of gone over by accident . ; It was just very quiet ,
Bro003_446	Um , the the stuff that we 've been working on with TIMIT , trying to get a , um a labels file so we can , uh , train up a train up a net on TIMIT and test , um , the difference between this net trained on TIMIT and a net trained on digits alone . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and seeing if if it hurts or helps . ; And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ?
Bmr013_37	And so ; One particular test set of TI - digits . ; Test set , OK . ; So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set .
Bed008_1402	So so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . ; It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1289	So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . ; That 's it . ; Wait I I 'm sorry ? ; Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum ,
Bmr001_792	Wow . ; Yeah . ; And uh we 'll see which one of those seems closest to right ; and if they ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it
Bro028_479	Um . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah . That look ; Yeah .
Bmr024_521	Yep . ; Um another one that we had on Adam 's agenda that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ? ; Right . ; So , Rob Porzel
Bmr024_1137	You saying NW archive ? ; NW archive . ; That 's what it is . ; Yep And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups .
Bro023_1461	but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one . ; Same thing for the shape of the the noise . ; Maybe it would be better to add just white noise instead of speech shaped noise . ; That 'd be more like the JRASTA thing in a sense .
Bro028_394	It 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you . ; Mm - hmm . ; In fact , you hear some things better than others . ; And so it it isn't
Bro023_246	Right . ; Oh , the other thing I guess which which , ; uh , ; I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system
Bro004_170	Twenty percent further ? ; Twenty to to thirty percent further . ; Yeah . ; And so , remind me ,
Bro003_1237	Yeah . ; And I think there there there 's I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now . ; Is it faster to do it on the SPERT , ; or ?
Bed008_549	Well this was ; uh let 's p put it this let 's do endpoint underbar - U . ; end point ? ; i endpoint , e end poi
Bsr001_1166	This could be the most popular corpus . ; but you have to ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bed004_665	OK . ; So you could have the conditional p ; So ; the each of these things is gonna be a a a probability .
Bro005_1116	Maybe . ; Mmm . ; I 'm sorry ? ; Yeah . Well
Bro010_1294	yeah , ; I didn't notice this . ; I 'm sitting here ; and I was I was about to read them too .
Bmr020_333	You know , it goes down from maybe For Switchboard it goes down from I don't know f um I don't know f fourteen percent of the words to maybe uh I don't know , eleven percent or something ; it 's it 's not a dramatic change , ; so it 's ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_285	Uh - huh . ; And then ; And and so what 's ; ho I don't understand .
Bed006_365	The The goals that we 've d you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's like the Enter versus View ; Yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction ,
Bmr020_88	so . ; Right . ; I hope they accept it . ; I mean , I
Bed003_1461	but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I could be wrong though .
Bmr031_90	Yeah . ; So I have a couple of minor ones . ; Uh , ; our normal transcription status ,
Bed002_793	Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , ; and it understands you completely . ; And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , ; dial a number ,
Bns002_488	for example , this node is a neighbor of the receiving node , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node . ; Yeah .
Bro017_549	because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and
Bro003_1717	The That that really throws things off . ; You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector , ; I mean the the , um ; What was it ?
Bro021_949	but , well , in the time domain we have an exponential . ; No ? ; No ? ; Oh , maybe it 's I am
Bed012_118	right ? ; So every part of a structure is a " Struct " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I just uh I just was abbreviated it to Struct in my head , and started going with that .
Bmr009_1349	And and wouldn't ; Yeah . ; So , th I 'm from Kansas , actually . ; And Colorado , right across the border , would be North Midland .
Bmr019_1803	Well , we have a time ; No , we prefer to keep it for ourselves . ; During ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr015_713	If if if , uh If I don't have enough time and y you wanna discuss with someone else ; some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be Stephane . ; Yeah . ; I talked with Stephane and and Thilo
Bed003_861	So , the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel . ; It 's the hotel Zum Ritter , ; which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah . ; Hmm .
Bed013_491	uh , both learning and like , comprehension , production , that kinda stuff . ; Psycho . ; You could look at the web site . ; OK .
Bro016_193	So that 's why I think ; that 's another reason other than curiosity as to why i it would in fact be kinda neat to find out if we 're way off . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , the other thing is , are aren't we seeing ? Y y
Bed004_308	Great . ; and we also have a l little bit on the interface , ; M - three - L enhancement , ; and then um that was it , I think .
Bmr024_1463	There 's a lot of , ; actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . ; Um . ; You do a total of
Bro003_188	So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing . ; Oh , this is ; Uh , yeah . ; yeah , yeah .
Bmr016_1927	which is to add " NUMS " if these are parts of the read numbers . ; Now you already know i that I had , uh , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put " numbers " in place of any kind of numbers , ; but there are places where they , ; um , it th this convention came later
Bmr002_649	because um I I do think ; You don't ; Just take the thing with you . ; Th - i It 's wireless .
Bed014_1099	That 's OK . ; It 'll be more like towards finalizing that proposal . ; OK , that 's fine . ; OK .
Bed003_614	but . ; OK . ; That all you want ? ; Yes .
Bmr021_981	and this must become a problem especially with non - speech - meetings . ; So um ; is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from some of the channels , ; or ?
Bsr001_1579	I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ? ; Wizard of Oz . ; OK , ; so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end
Bmr006_1219	and and and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . ; Yeah . ; It seems to me that that it 's not a p uh , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1215	So probably it it would do that . ; like this , ; It 's one mixture of the model . Right ? ; but conditional .
Bed004_291	you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine . ; You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . " ; But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what 's going on with the system design , ; and where we think the belief - nets fit in
Bmr003_640	Right ? ; N right . ; That 's ; Well th there is als
Bmr028_1276	It 's ; No . But if you w just want to see what ; Like , suppose you fixed some typ No , Jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the word error , ; then we can f we c
Bro014_410	That 's a that 's a that 's an arg ; I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing . ; that 's an ar ; Well , that 's an argument for it ,
Bed003_1219	You know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms ; is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , ; and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_234	because we 'll we might use use this up , uh , in some sense , ; Mm - hmm . ; but but uh ; Right .
Bed002_1196	So this was was a usual jo ; Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro017_210	Exactly . ; And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically . ; Hmm . ; But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down ,
Bmr012_878	Mm - hmm . ; is that ; I thought that in order to ; Yep .
Bro011_484	Mm - hmm . ; And we don't ; We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . ; In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting .
Bed010_671	Yeah , it sounds like it , ; doesn't it , ; It 's a lot like it . ; yeah .
Bmr012_1009	and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card . ; It might be a hard limitation , ; So ; I mean one thing is it the whole thing as I said is is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling
Bsr001_2179	Uh - huh . ; I don't think we have any problem . ; I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC . ; No ,
Bmr016_2220	No , but I mean my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized , ; like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing , ; and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of uh transcripts . ; Well , you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate .
Btr001_2003	Yeah . ; and no idea what you 're talking about . " ; And there was a whole set of meetings that are like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_40	Well , yeah . I just don't know if this is th l what the Does This is what Java Bayes takes ? as a Bayes - net spec ? ; No , because I mean if we I mean we 're sure gonna interface to We 're gonna get an XML document from somewhere . ; Right ? ; And that XML document will say " We are able to We were able to observe that w the element , um , @ @ of the Location that the car is near . "
Bed002_172	Anything else ? ; No . ; OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . ; It should be on already .
Bed002_1174	Right . ; Um , ; it 's , uh ; It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .
Bmr014_897	and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . ; So much fun . ; and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , ; right
Bmr011_972	Cuz ; OK . ; But but the , uh I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , ; and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of
Bsr001_2473	Yeah . ; That 's like the TIMIT sentences . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro004_320	It doesn't seem to matter ; The difference between three and four is not particularly great , ; so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . ; Mmm .
Bro005_422	So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , ; which is that , uh the eighty - four point six . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bed008_590	So now we 're looking for user related things that um ; Yeah . ; And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , ; I don't know ,
Bmr028_682	Y yeah . He just didn't say when . ; So ; Yeah . He ; Well , no . I think he wanted u us to tell him when .
Bed004_81	Uh ; Let 's get started . ; The uh ; Should I go first , with the uh , um , data .
Bed004_771	There 're no primitives upon which uh ; u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this ; yeah . ; So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case ,
Bed006_923	Right , right . ; and do we have means of of telling it within that ; Right . ; a and the answer is absolutely .
Bmr003_826	Put put it on your sweater . ; At what part ? ; OK , ; I 'm alright .
Bmr001_511	Pardon ? ; I 'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone 's still using it . ; How much space is that using up ? ; Do you have any idea ?
Btr001_188	I forget who it was that I was transcribing ; but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying , uh , at any given point in time ; and I would I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going " Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! " ; like , not really understanding a
Bed009_885	Or is that something that ; Um , yeah but it 's all in the in the lexicon . ; But did you have that ? ; So it 's
Bmr011_108	which Don is gonna be working on soon , ; it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1323	And they 're they 've been quite responsive . ; eh ; I 've been exchanging emails on various issues . ; Oh , really ?
Bmr019_1177	It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ? ; Right . But it has one the first column has the meeting name , ; It 's just ; so it could actually contain several meetings .
Bmr018_1647	Yeah . ; Right . ; and then there 's people saying , " Oh , just add more data . " ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1378	Yeah . ; Right . ; and then we can flag those later . ; They they
Bmr019_941	Yeah , I I mean , i in retrospect it would 've been good to ha have got I should 've gotten a headphone . ; But in any case , um , thi this is this was transcribed in a in a , uh , less optimal way than than the ones that came after it , ; and I was able to you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications ; Well , I know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions .
Bro011_445	Guess you could , yeah . ; Bin them up into different categories and ; Yeah . ; So anyway that 's that 's uh that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .
Bdb001_368	And a and again , if you have a ; Hmm ? ; if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna ; They 're they 're fair they 're quite large .
Bed013_1026	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way , ; and probably not practical .
Bed013_160	but look at it look at our Bayes - net . ; If we don't have Let 's assume we don't have any input from the language . Right ? ; So there 's also nothing we could query the ontology , ; but we have a certain user setting .
Bro004_985	This is still something that ; Well no , ; I think ; yeah ,
Bmr014_606	OK . ; So . ; But basically that 's one of the main changes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_249	They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're uh assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . ; Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? ; And and I mean , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . ; I think we 'd have a better chance
Bed006_1067	one of which is l ; you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second . ; Yeah , yeah ! ; Right .
Btr001_212	Uh , ; you know . ; Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ . ; What 's
Bmr003_2070	That 's right . ; " Or not to be " . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_117	I don't think that really matters ; because the conditions are so different . ; And that would be a little easier . ; Well how many are how how often does that happen ?
Bmr027_734	Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the ? ; Or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep ; Encrypt it . ; You can hide it . Yeah .
Bro017_148	So what about the issue of um the weights on the for the different systems , ; the well - matched , and medium - mismatched and ; Yeah , ; that 's what that 's a g very good uh point ,
Bed005_1060	So ; right ? ; So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . ; It 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ,
Bmr009_1513	cuz in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help . ; Oh yeah . ; So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough . ; Yeah .
Buw001_125	And so , you know ; I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , uh , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . ; Well ; But that 's alright .
Bsr001_1779	We weren't ; Yeah . ; Hmm ? ; OK , but you have to put on a You have to put on a mike .
Bed015_754	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; that was my way of saying as opposed to , you know , " Oh , he didn't g " or " There was a meeting ? " ; I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately .
Bmr022_952	Are they ? ; Why would it be cool ? ; that Sony ; The connector that Sony has , that , uh
Bro022_213	So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing . ; I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , ; but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , ; uh , at n
Btr001_2670	Used to be . ; That 's what I thought too . ; Used to be . ; Oh ,
Btr001_374	OK . ; Yeah , I mean he was never like ; it was never up to like a native speaker , ; but like that it got a little easier .
Bmr023_462	No . ; For all the Meeting Recorder data . ; We should have . ; Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there .
Bsr001_351	you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , ; Actually , I use something like this on on the telephone and it 's very comfortable . ; Yeah . ; I , uh ,
Bed014_1093	So that 's OK for you ; and do an on - line merging with my construal ideas . ; Sure , sure . ; OK .
Btr001_130	Oh . ; Oh . ; Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be ; No .
Bmr016_1665	w s ; So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . ; Yeah that 's ; Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it .
Bed008_425	Yeah . ; What ex um and so either those is true f or false ? ; So ; Uh Uh well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky .
Bro017_682	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1998	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; that 's right . ; Mmm .
Bed015_1791	Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ? ; Yeah . ; What ? ; No .
Bmr024_299	Mm - hmm . ; And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . ; You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . ; And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels ,
Bed015_547	In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . ; Hmm . ; In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1592	so if you need need help let me know . ; OK . ; Let 's read some digits . ; OK .
Bmr011_550	But then , you know , there 's it there 's ; What you save , I mean , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah ; There 's ; I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is .
Bns001_736	You know , radio frequency technology , ; wide - band w uh CDMA . ; These kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched . ; But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing here .
Bdb001_1069	Mmm . ; But let me look at it again . ; OK , ; great .
Bmr003_2045	What ? ; That that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . ; These six tables here , with with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . ; OK .
Bmr007_506	but That may not be the case if you couldn't see them . ; u ; But but , it 's sort of odd if one person 's speaking and everybody 's listening , ; and it 's unusual to have everybody going " uh - huh , uh - huh "
Bmr020_708	So what I did is I um @ @ I made a n new directory ; after Chuck said that would c that was gonna be a good thing . ; Uh , so it 's " FTP pub ; Pub real .
Bmr003_849	and ; Is this already in the past or already in the future ? ; Already in the past . ; You 've already you 've already done some ?
Bro023_275	Mmm . ; So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro003_2061	The soft training of the nets still requires the vector to sum to one , though , ; To sum up to one . ; right ? ; So you can't really feed it , like , two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones
Bed015_1932	So that that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer ; and other things we 'll put on a list of of research problems or something , ; because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done ; because every time you start to do something you say , " oh , yeah , but what about this case ? "
Bed016_840	but there was also a paper on " out " . ; Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner , ; right ? ; Or something .
Bmr011_1444	OK . ; Yeah . So the ; I thought that all these people had sort of said " no " twice already . ; No , no . No .
Bmr026_975	which ; Well the other thing is , dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Btr001_2225	Yeah , ; interesting . ; Yeah . ; And " or " tends to be used with questions more than So .
Bro003_1586	Well , there 's different there , um , there 's ; right ? ; Right . ; So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch .
Bro024_1752	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , yeah , ; i i i the condition where it 's better than your approach , it 's it just because maybe it 's better on well matched and that the weight on well matched is is bigger ,
Bed008_825	So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , ; and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for ; We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . ; Of of course .
Bro025_237	What was the issue with the VAD ? ; Well , better ones are good . ; And so the w the default , uh , boundaries that they provide are they 're OK , but they 're not all that great ? ; I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ?
Bmr010_416	Yeah . ; cuz they 're they 're , ; you know , they 're focused on the ear anyway . ; Right .
Bns002_56	so in the meantime everybody got , I believe , this pointer from me , ; and ; maybe we It 's a homework , in principle , for the next meeting , to get a little bit familiar with these things . ; Worse than no work .
Btr001_1444	And so they 'll get ; And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of of transcribed slots . ; As there are slots in the pre - segmentation . ; Exactly .
Bed002_258	Um . ; Okay , I This , um These intentions , we w w we could , if we want to , call it the the Vista mode , ; where we just want to eh s get the overview or look at it , ; the Enter mode ,
Bmr016_1540	Well , and I do have a stress marker here . ; Sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up , ; and , um ; I 'm sorry , I I got lost here .
Bns001_1373	you know , what is really the outcome ; what is really the problem we are going to solve . ; These are my questions . ; And if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money .
Btr001_2235	I 've heard you say " so " , in that sort of sense ; like uh , um , " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Like a sort of an inad
Bro007_88	Yeah . ; I mean not ; Uh not yet . ; No .
Bed004_892	Yeah . ; So I think that um I mean , w ; Looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem , ; for example , is , you know , she actually m said you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff .
Bmr011_1817	Mm - hmm . ; And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio ,
Bmr019_737	cuz there 's no adaptation yet . ; So there 's I think there 's some issues about u ; We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . ; But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker ,
Bro003_580	Of the these language . ; But n for example , in Spain , the Spanish have several phone that d doesn't appear in the E English and we thought to complete . ; But for that , it needs we must r h do a lot of work because we need to generate new tran transcription for the database that we have . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_338	and find out what they were talking about . ; And you r ; Yeah . ; Well , what it does is provide a different
Bed008_1376	whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . ; So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , ; so what you can have is ; you augment these diagrams like this
Btr002_3415	We did it ; Oh we did ! ; Yeah . ; Oh !
Bed014_228	Yeah , I know . ; Tha - that 's the part I didn't understand . ; Um , I suggested to try something that was really kind of ; even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked ,
Bmr014_381	What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , ; that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , ; and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . ; Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " .
Bro021_1163	Of the noise ; I estimate the noises wi ; Well , for the noises I only use one Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1067	OK . Just " where is X " ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Or any variants of that . ; Yeah .
Bed002_601	I mean , you need them both , ; but they 're quite distinct . ; And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . ; Except to find out what seems to be useful .
Bro015_182	Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful . ; OK . ; Oh . You know , there is one other thing . ; Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday um where th uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um the number of iterations , that I talked about last week ?
Bmr002_497	But um , yeah , that 's quite you know we 've That 's been done . ; I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that . ; Yeah . ; She 's really She 's done Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally .
Bro005_1126	but PLP seems pretty good . " ; If we take the approach that Mike did and have ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions .
Bmr008_902	Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sounds good . ; That 's to handle that unusual percent or two .
Bmr015_583	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , as I said ; That sounds good .
Btr001_1116	or I don't know I mean , could do anything ; This is fine . ; This time is fine for me . ; about
Bro004_820	True . ; posteriors vector ; um ; which means that
Bmr027_1106	Mmm . ; And they 're generally extremely good , ; but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check ; and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance
Bro010_969	It 's it 's just ; And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um , the , uh , ; uh he he did a comparison to , uh , you know , our old foil , ; the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth .
Bro019_314	Yeah . ; Yeah , and and also uh , Stephane 's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yep .
Btr001_1079	It must be really rare though , ; I haven't run across that often . ; Ha - ha h Is it rare ? ; Mmm - mm .
Bro019_284	We can ask him sometime . ; But ; Yeah . ; I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY ,
Bro010_83	Uh , ; I ; yeah , ; I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to
Bed013_968	Mm - hmm . ; And that might , you know , give us additional input to belief A versus B . ; Or E versus A . ; So it 's not just a particular word 's
Bmr019_804	No , not ; I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_128	OK . ; And the ; Do they know about your pie chart ? ; I don't know .
Bro004_79	So . ; Oh wait wait wait wait wait . Wait . ; Get out of the ; Yeah .
Bed002_954	to to give ; Yeah , ; uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_72	The spectral shape , ; yeah . ; Yeah , ; and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that .
Bed015_1981	yeah . ; Yeah . ; I didn't want to think too much about that for for now . ; OK .
Bro010_300	Yeah . ; I mean , it would be f ; I mean , it might even be too abrupt . ; You might have to put in a s a s a delay .
Buw001_1538	but ; Yeah . ; w Just " what would you like to know ? " ; Yeah .
Bro012_518	I 'm really confused about something . ; If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah that 's th
Bmr019_1789	Keep in touch . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I guess , uh , unless somebody has something else , we 'll read read our digits
Bmr008_1528	It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap ; It 's li I think the last page . ; Yeah . ; Is it ?
Bro012_633	Aalborg ; uh ; Oh . ; So the deadline
Bdb001_775	OK . ; So we would basically be sort of , um , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file , ; r ; Right .
Bed017_365	Good . Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . ; Or Andy , for that matter ? ; OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . ; Um , so maybe just a a little background on on my visit .
Bed015_1375	that , uh , once we have this defined , it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_984	Yeah , it 's just , I I know that there are periods where two people are talking in t at the same time ; Right ? ; At the same time . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bns001_1146	I wouldn't ; but at least the different application of protocol - based usage . ; So you have uh one connection , one application uses FTP whatever , ; bit voice or some other
Bro003_536	you 're right . ; It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , " Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? " ; uh . And that 's something you could ask , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1261	What - what does CVS do if they if they do overlap ? ; Uh , there 're lots of different policies for dealing with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; But typically a person has to , uh , mediate you know , which changes actually get go through .
Btr001_2386	It 's possible . ; It 's possible . ; So you meant just sort of like a just a normal " uh " ? ; It 's just a normal " uh " .
Buw001_575	When I have meetings on the European projects , we have someone taking notes . ; Oh , really ? ; In fact , I often do it . ; Yeah , but those are bigger deal things .
Bmr010_1545	we suppose that , eh , the the first step I mean , the the classifier ; what ; were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ? ; W What happen with the second step ?
Bmr003_438	Not head mounted ? ; Yeah . ; And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , ; or are they using multiple DATs ?
Bmr008_1664	I mean ; What do you look at in order to normalize ? ; I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is , how do you how do you W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it by ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1944	but ; Oh , and the groupings are important , ; bu ; Mmm .
Bmr026_754	So , it would be good . ; Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the uh the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best ; you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . ; Bridge .
Bro012_941	So . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ?
Bmr001_622	And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working . ; I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1139	Talk slowly but with few words . ; And clearly . ; And ; That 's right .
Bmr025_503	Oh really ? ; So ; I mean this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text ; OK .
Bmr010_1204	But , uh , just let me say with reference to this idea of , um , higher - order organization within meetings . ; So like in a ; you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , uses of the data , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_162	Cuz if a beep is treated as a unique word , ; You mean , so , actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it . ; " beep " ; Put in put " beep " in as a word .
Bmr018_1527	Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data . ; Um , but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place , ; and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines ; and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture ,
Bsr001_2128	Well , the I mean , and in some ways that does change the , uh , the economics of doing that . ; I mean , it 's ; Can you do that ? ; Right .
Bed014_323	Uh , which they call dynamic ; they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . ; Mmm . ; So there 's a term " dynamic belief - net " , doesn't mean that .
Bed006_796	Mm - hmm . ; the Goal will store the the f ; So the fillers of the role source . ; we 'll fill those in fill those roles in ,
Bro011_423	and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them . ; Yeah . ; So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . ; Hmm .
Bro026_362	Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth ; but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . ; But what what ; So how did they fill up this all these these bits ?
Bro016_1026	It 's that 's pretty much it . ; Oh , well . ; No ; Um , why don't you say something about what it is ?
Bed010_99	Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , ; you know . And then all that good stuff . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1150	I I need to s ; Yeah . ; I don't know exactly . ; Cuz I think what 's certainly characteristic of a lot of the data in this test is that , um , you don't have the
Bro005_1170	And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . ; But one way or another we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . ; So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that ; um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making ,
Bed002_284	They are uncomfortable . ; Mm - hmm . ; Really small ? ; OK . I see .
Bed008_1038	Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things ; you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ?
Btr001_320	Mm - hmm . ; actually she she was in the middle phase I would say . ; We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult . ; Hmm .
Bro012_1049	OK . ; Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ? ; It 's uh in June . ; the next uh
Bro014_863	How do you know ? ; So ; Mmm . ; How did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data ?
Bmr008_49	so , I had a first pass of it , ; and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff ; and so I have a first pass at it . ; And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it .
Bmr010_727	this was about twelve twelve years ago or something . ; And , um , ; they were they were perturbed with me ; because I was breathing in instead of breathing out .
Bsr001_924	That 's right , with all the i interrupts . ; Right . ; So it 's just got a d ; it 's a lot easier .
Bmr009_118	So . ; And when he 's looking in straight energy he is , ; so that 's a good place to start . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1200	Um ; Yeah , ; and the different points of the curves are for five uh , thresholds on the probability uh from point three to point seven . ; So that threshold
Bns001_1670	Yeah , what is our ; So they they want to make this available pretty soon . ; So I 'm just trying to think uh m more ahead , like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something . ; So so whenever you come in with your uh GSM phone and there is a PC available , like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something .
Bmr011_385	yeah . ; No , ; he did start on it . ; e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side ,
Bmr014_10	I think the date 's written in there , yep . ; And actually if everyone could cross out the R - nine next to " Session " , and write MR eleven . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1126	which include ; Yeah , we can discuss later , off - line . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed008_1190	OK ; Mm - hmm . ; and everything else fades ; and you just see the links that are relevant to that .
Bro021_708	So , ; I was like I 'm trying to find where the m m problem came , ; Uh - huh . ; and it seems to be , like , somewhere
Bns001_1095	Yeah . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; But usually WAP shouldn't is so general that it can be used with UMTS . ; So if you still want to use WAP with UMTS you might be able to do it .
Bmr006_602	" We " By " we " of course I mean Dave . ; Wow . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_817	And I wrote in there " En - Enough " people have to be there . ; And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people . ; Yeah . ; And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say " How much cheese do you want ? "
Bro017_383	so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1237	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself ,
Bmr026_558	But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . ; And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system , rather than on new disk . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Btr001_1778	I You know , who knows , but ; but yeah . ; Have you noticed that Tiger ; I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a cough .
Bmr003_2293	Yeah . ; Yeah , I understand . ; So . ; and I can certainly build it out of oak
Bed015_1833	which is the mental the whole s mental space thing . ; And then there 's some other minor things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity .
Bed013_1198	Mmm , yeah . ; Info - on is True - up , and that Go - there is True - up , as well . ; Which would be exactly analogous to what I 'm proposing is , this makes uh makes something here true , ; and this makes something also something here true ,
Bro004_376	because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English , ; because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , ; at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1191	Have a little antenna coming out the bottom . ; It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , ; isn't it ? ; But then the mike has to h
Bns002_1512	OK . ; Yeah ? ; Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it , ; and I got the statement
Bed008_1478	right ? ; So this is what we wanna learn . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr003_1777	Right . ; Excellent . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_561	Yep . ; uh , like these P - files or anything like that . ; And that 's sort of the world of things that I ; And then we have the aligned channels , of course ,
Bmr024_976	but that 's pretty annoying , ; because the C Ds are so slow . ; See ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1234	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Should we do the digits ? ; Yep .
Bro017_325	This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition . ; Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands , ; but then oh uh uh ; so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands .
Bmr013_365	Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Exactly . ; Yeah , no I I don't disagree with that .
Bdb001_722	So I think that 's that would wor ; Um , OK . ; Let me look at it again . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1822	So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , ; but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , yeah , in the case of " tickle " I guess we would just have a , you know , word " TCL " which
Btr001_939	Mm - hmm . ; A person says , " Mm - kay " ; Mm - hmm . ; then ,
Bro024_1364	the that was my idea . ; I mean , if if it ha if it is not the same labeling which is taking the spaces . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr012_261	Mmm . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; and so the channels get a little asynchronous
Bro028_993	Gets thrown out . ; Yeah . ; so we 'll throw it out ; and we 're gonna randomly select another feature from the set of possible basis functions .
Bro027_575	I guess it 's for the fr the ; OK . ; And then there 's delta besides that ? ; So this is the features that are used by our network
Bmr028_922	all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking . ; assume that the same person ; So , ; Mmm .
Bed016_826	they haven't ; Uh . ; there was this whole thesis on " out of " . ; There was ?
Bmr026_95	so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected ; and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's ; Can you mail that out to the list ? ; Mm - hmm , yeah I will .
Bmr014_1242	Not really . ; No . ; Um , my project is going along ; but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress .
Bro017_226	That 's what we want to try . ; I have a visitor from Brno . ; He 's a kind of like young faculty . ; pretty hard - working so he so he 's so he 's looking into that .
Bmr015_527	Yeah . ; Alright , ; so we we have th we 're gonna have the speaker ID , ; the session ,
Bro013_280	So this I think , on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder . ; Mmm . ; Um . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_662	Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the the the slide of data . ; Like do we know from the data wh which ; Um ; OK .
Bns003_307	Yeah , ; OK . ; Good , ; yeah I ju
Bed005_997	So ; Does I mean , they sort of ; the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something , ; and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .
Bmr013_970	the microphones the new microphones , ; when do we get , uh ? ; Uh , they said it would take about a week . ; Oh , exciting . K .
Bmr018_104	OK . ; So so the deal is that I can , um , uh , I can be available after , uh , like ten thirty or something . ; Why don't we w ; I don't know how s how early you wanted to
Bmr028_1468	And , in a sense , that was cheating . ; OK . ; So i so it it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people " well , we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way . ; But , I 'll convince you that that it 's still important for you to listen to what I have to say next because of this and this . "
Bmr006_300	Oh - yeah . ; Ye - Yeah , yeah . ; Right ? ; That 's very easy ,
Bro027_904	Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1022	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2854	Yeah . ; Um , ; and in a n like a friendly conversation I I notice that that 's not really true . ; Like what you were saying .
Bro026_181	Mm - hmm . ; So ; Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . ; This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .
Bmr011_1087	Oh good . ; Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , ; uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , ; Right .
Bmr005_504	Yeah . ; Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . ; It 's a good idea I think . ; So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here
Bmr019_1366	I if it w ; Yeah . ; I could submit that to Aurora . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_658	So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting ; and between you know , whoever 's interested in that ; because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about ; but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh
Bro011_72	I guess . ; Uh . ; Yeah . ; So again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream
Bmr016_1333	Yeah . It 's much easier . ; And this is this 'll be great . ; So I 'll I 'll be able to get through that tonight , ; and then everyth i well , actually later today probably .
Bsr001_1708	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Right . ; Cool .
Bed015_1303	Except for " cause " , that I forgot . ; But anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events . ; Yeah . ; OK , good .
Bed015_1095	We 'll just we 'll j ; So some of these are , uh ; we just don't know yet . ; Right .
Bed002_445	but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time , ; and i ; That 's not getting at the scientific problem , ; and it 's
Buw001_2022	Not not entirely modify it , ; but lessen it if if it 's desired . ; But if if that 's sufficient data ; I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .
Bmr020_1395	So I was gonna say , EDU - one is good enough , ; Yeah . ; maybe we could include it in this in this set of uh , this stuff we send . ; Yeah there 's I I think there are some meetings where it would would It 's possible like this .
Bed014_129	Mm - hmm . ; Sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh , the German concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules
Bed010_825	So there 's that . ; And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . ; So " OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_341	and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work ; if it 's got um , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses ; or my beliefs and your beliefs , ; or any of these other ones of of multiple models .
Bmr006_996	Yeah . ; But I think this is a good place to start . ; But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know ; Yeah .
Bro007_405	The my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English . ; Yeah . ; Uh so ; Mmm .
Bmr016_595	Let 's see , th ; I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . ; Horrible ? ; And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .
Bro027_717	Yeah , ; that 's what it seems like to me . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_195	It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at SRI ; Yeah . ; because the um ; Yep .
Bro026_608	Interesting . ; OK . ; Yeah , I guess . ; So these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or
Bns002_60	And um ; so I believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion , ; maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days , until the next meeting . ; And when we are ready with our meeting .
Bmr003_1248	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . ; W we 'd like you to do it
Bro012_369	No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement ; not of the error rate . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case ,
Bmr013_894	and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , ; but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . ; And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , ; they 're like it 's in the room .
Bed003_1550	Mm - hmm . ; and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . ; That feed into those ? ; Nah ?
Bmr016_1478	Oh . ; This makes sense . ; Yeah I I think you 've ; uh - huh , yeah .
Bmr003_841	It 's just a matter of a very c clear ; it 's XML , isn't it ? ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's very I mean , I looked at the the file format and it 's just it has a t a time a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other .
Bed011_649	Oh ; " I want to meet someone somewhere " , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the " EVA " ; you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually , ; Yeah .
Bed016_266	probably . ; Two s ; Can you hear that ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_893	You have to use your time to finish your work as you uh , have in mind until your end of February , ; or is that right ? ; January , ; yes .
Bro012_1180	OK . ; and ; So go ahead . ; Um yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream
Bmr002_1012	And uh see what it looks like . ; Good . ; You - you can access it through um through the , uh , whatever ; I can't remember which aspect of U of U Penn I was following ,
Bro003_366	but I I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . ; If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much . ; Maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest doesn't matter . ; Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which I I guess they 're starting to look at up there , training to something more like articulatory features .
Bed016_761	Right . ; could we capture that ; with a different construal of ; Yeah , it 's a little it 's ,
Bmr024_699	Well it 's it well , because ; It 's just a different topic . ; I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . ; Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason .
Bro023_1717	So , it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one . ; Because ; What ? ; Uh , you mean their d the frame dropping , right ?
Bmr001_869	OK . ; What fun it is . ; Well , you know , it 's not , but ; It 's interesting that um it m it 's not clear whether it 's better to have them written as as words or or figures .
Bmr007_918	Yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; So , he was trying to get something going ,
Bro024_996	and ; So . ; I don't know it f fares for the other conditions . ; So it 's just like it 's like a three percent relative degradation ,
Bed014_1172	Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence ; and I 'm sure you guys have uh , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at the rest of it ; Um , I ; it 'd it 'd be useful for me , if we want to have it a little bit more data oriented .
Bmr006_1247	But ; That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? " ; Right . ; If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,
Bsr001_2364	Oh , yeah , ; Declination , yeah . ; right . ; d
Bmr009_1397	and uh New Jersey is not New England and Maryland is not New England and none of those are the South . ; OK . So . ; Another suggestion . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_789	Mm - hmm . ; No . ; Um . OK . ; Well , if if if I just need to use that subset , I I can get it processed .
Bed017_441	So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? ; And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , ; and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking . ; And that 's what I then propagate back to the user ,
Bro024_1137	Yeah . ; So , ; yeah , there are two figures showing actually the , mmm , um , performance of the current VAD . ; So it 's a n neural network based on PLP parameters ,
Bmr028_1356	i ; Cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology ? ; Cuz it sounds like it sort of devalues the the , um , all other approach , which is to to put those distinctions in . ; Maybe . I I 've heard this at ICSLP for years and years and years , though .
Btr002_3263	but that that 's not functional ; because we have these two different numbering schemes . ; You have the numbering in the Channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the " key " file ; Yeah .
Bro018_162	What if you stopped being clever ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful ; and figure out what they can what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at .
Bns001_373	But uh what I I would like to ask Wilbert here , and we discuss it yesterday , " Is it only the usage of that PCMCIA card where you have instead of GSM today , UMTS , and instead of wireless LAN today also wireless LAN . ; Remember your four and one card uh concerning um , ; what is the name , from Dataco - ? ; No .
Bro024_1177	but I think it 's it may be due to the fricative sounds ; which may be in noisy condition maybe label labelled as silence . ; And it may also be due to the alignment ; because
Btr002_2116	Yes ! ; Cuz I also tend ; Like , we were talking about " so " . ; I do that .
Bro007_193	uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things ; Mm - hmm . ; so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their their measure ; and are are we running this uh for TI - digits
Bmr003_1874	we can do it all ! ; OK . ; We can write ; Web site 's nice .
Bro025_336	I see . ; So , right now the LDA delays are more . ; And there ; Oh , OK .
Bmr018_675	Yeah . ; but then there were the others were sort of decaying from there . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bmr020_359	uh , well Don 's been working hard . ; That 's right . ; OK , ; so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow ,
Bmr015_680	Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting . ; Uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume , ; Is true . ; I haven't results , eh , yet
Bro005_159	Mm - hmm . ; And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP , ; Mm - hmm . ; and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better .
Bdb001_622	Um , so it 's like a segment or something . ; Yeah . ; So , ; I mean , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit ,
Bro007_288	what was that ? ; Uh ; It the the output silence of the MLP . ; Oh yeah
Bed015_989	You know . ; Yeah , that 's what " wa " is , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1295	but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . ; So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things . ; Oh , I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2434	what what did we do cuz wha what was it that I ; oh , I was ; " Lipsmack " ! ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1129	You probably won't notice a difference . ; But it 's I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . ; I mean , obviously . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1138	The the model ; and , well , ; the HTK model . ; Uh , right .
Bed010_16	Yeah , I think so too . ; Um . ; The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like " Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . " ; It actually says , " Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , "
Bmr027_234	No , just ; and then make comments on what you want me to change ? ; No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . ; I I 'm what I 'm what I 'm I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it
Bns002_473	OK . ; So ; Um , a further question . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2195	I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator . ; I mean , there 's a there 's a blind man in this in this building , ; Oh . ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_891	whereas if they want to um ; Right . ; so ; Right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting ,
Bmr007_704	Um , what I had thought we were gonna do is just take pictures of the whiteboards . rather than take pictures of the meeting . ; Well , linguistic ; And , uh ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1411	That 's not hard to do . ; Just it takes you know , it just takes five minutes rather than , taking a second . ; OK ; Yeah .
Bed003_368	and maybe what changes we ; Yeah , th ; OK . ; so one thing I I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the " admission fee " thing set up .
Bro024_955	So ; Hmm . ; Maybe it 's just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector ; did
Bro021_498	Mmm . ; Right . ; Cool . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1543	But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck , ; even though automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we can sort of cheat on that factor
Btr001_2066	Yeah . ; Wow . ; And , you know I mean , th that was the meeting where , um , @ @ you know the m the th y y Partitions wouldn't work . ; Another possibility is pa partitions wouldn't work
Bmr005_783	Well ; I 'm working on a program to do that , and ; be um , because that would be interesting ; especially because the bottleneck is the transcription .
Bed014_1328	No , right . I mean , tha that role is is , uh , indispensable ; but that 's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings . ; Right . ; Yeah , yeah . No , that 's fine .
Bro012_642	It 's great . ; So we should definitely get something in for that . ; Yeah . ; But on meeting digits , maybe there 's
Bmr028_355	If we wanna show this in public , it should be releas ; So , I , uh , haven't gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval . ; So I sent out another set this morning . ; I th I saw that .
Bmr005_1249	hopefully they will collect more at UW also ; and um and maybe we have this other source . ; But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . ; I mean , that was sort of our goal .
Btr002_2501	and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like ; I don't know , like , um Hhh . ; I would say " tongue click " for that . ; Yeah .
Buw001_737	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; so , um ; Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier
Bro019_977	Um , ; Uh - huh . ; Mmm , yeah . ; Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , uh , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh , noise removal , uh , with with these other things we have ,
Bmr026_435	I th ; I have a lot of space and it 's not it 's n ; Not not for long . ; There 's very little uh
Bns001_425	I don't s see it , ; but maybe you have a additional idea . ; And I don't think that this end system device uh architecture , which will come automatically . ; And I believe there 's a lot of activity throughout the world ,
Bmr021_577	I wouldn't just wanna change them you know , without some advance notice . ; Right . ; I mean , th that 's all these segment names that we we 've been using . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_170	I 'm just saying fluency . ; But ; Well , I think that , um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2466	So , I mean , either either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already in the group already owns , a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not not a disadvan or else we we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Absolutely .
Bns002_1427	And that means , if you go to slide number three , that we have um the possibility to to um having normal features in the mobile access network , ; and ; and um ; and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh use novel things
Bmr027_814	and ; And it also doesn't give a a specific I didn't think of it . ; S I think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . ; Yeah , release .
Bmr022_938	that hangs has the mike on it . ; OK , so whatever people sort of wear to use l ; This one . ; Yeah .
Bed009_339	then , There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , ; Yes . ; presumably give it to you . ; That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer back .
Bro026_237	um So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out ; and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . ; Yeah , well , the , um , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . ; So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the FFT level .
Buw001_1929	I mean , that that 's ; Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like search . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_329	An ; Right . ; so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . ; Um And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it .
Bmr006_1639	y Yu - Ching . ; was that um , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . ; But , you know , h they won't know these people , ; so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention
Bro018_228	Maybe for voice - unvoice . ; Right . ; This is for the other one . ; I should I can't show that .
Bmr002_1255	because a lot of the time when people do rich um intonational and and stress - oriented transcription they don't have the digital record at the same time ; and the don't have it time - aligned . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know how large this is , actually .
Bro023_1138	or is that only with , uh , spectral subtraction ? ; No , you get it with Wiener filtering also . ; Yeah . ; Does the smoothing in the time domain help with that ?
Bro019_179	Oh , ; too much file transfer and stuff . ; Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt ; and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed ,
Bmr030_339	Uh , so that 's what you were working on , ; right ? ; Right . That 's the same software I used to get the data . ; Yeah . OK .
Btr001_671	You 've also gone through ; They 've been here since the beginning . ; You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed005_1299	Yeah . ; So , we are but we we 're not doing the ontology , ; so we have to get to whoever is doing the u ultimately , ; Indeed .
Bmr012_1400	So , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; Good .
Bed017_109	Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University , ; one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied .
Bro012_1268	I I missed that . ; Right ? ; I guess what you could do , maybe ; this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream ,
Bed015_1904	et cetera . ; So , uh ; OK . ; So a and we get this this , uh , portals fixed
Bro024_842	Still , I mean , it shouldn't confuse the ; Yeah , I mean , similar to what what you see really u in in the real um noisy situation . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_515	How many channels ? ; I mean , they can just limit the number of people . ; Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was ; but it was smaller than ours .
Bmr006_1044	What what model ? ; Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . ; Mm - hmm . ; So p
Bmr022_1265	So ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; Yeah , to decide which one is
Bmr002_447	you know , that the the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh or f you know half hour to forty minutes of running text . ; And so , for the pilot thing , you know , of course this would be useful . ; Right , this is the pilot data . ; And I w I wou I 'm assu I 'm assuming that I would not be uh you know e eh uh transcribing all of it .
Bns002_1587	um in on the slide number five , to see what uh is going on . ; And you see the difference . ; The amazing thing is that you have IP over IP . ; As you take a look to the the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and and all those things .
Bmr020_718	Ask Dan Ellis . ; Or ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_863	And of course it was English oriented , ; um w ; Yeah , and and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um ; Right .
Buw001_1434	getting just , uh , digital pictures ; a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting . ; Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . ; So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting ,
Bed003_560	Excellent . ; Do we have anything else to say about this ? ; We can do a little demo . ; Oh the
Bmr029_913	Once we ? ; Oh . ; We 're talking about the training speakers . ; Ah . Right , right , right , right , right .
Bed009_683	And and the the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on . ; And then extend it to an arbitrary number of applications eventually . ; So wouldn't ; That 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface
Bmr015_534	i ; Uh - huh . ; information on the speak on the channels and all that . ; OK .
Bmr023_955	u And but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Bro026_194	We just use the clean FFT bins . ; But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . ; This is an option that then you can ; Yeah .
Bmr007_36	That was that was sort of the point . ; So , uh I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did . ; So , ; So we all forgot .
Buw001_1405	But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information . ; I think " important " can often be uninteresting . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bed002_668	But , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_781	but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods ; Right . ; which you then get back in a transcript ; Well .
Bmr030_69	Yeah , that 's ; It 's mostly higher level . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr029_667	Right . Exactly . ; OK . OK . ; So will you talk to him about that , ; or do you want me to talk to him ?
Bmr016_939	Oh yeah . ; No . We always have the original long ones . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr028_984	Sorry . ; A Are the models gender - dependent ? ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed005_562	However , the , uh e So that you understand , it is really simple . ; Uh You you have a route , ; and you cut it up in different pieces . ; And every every element of that e r r f of that Every segment we call a " route element " .
Bns002_1160	and uh well just a quick comment about probably ; all of use are now aware of the availability of this eh standard the I - triple - E eight hundred and two point eleven ; uh in fact it is it is powering you know , uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area . ; And in the beginning , the first adaptors uh
Bmr019_1397	Um . ; Do not do not we are not setting a good example . ; Well , a relation other than negation , maybe , ; This is not a
Bmr015_298	and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , ; and we we , uh , got through that . ; And so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . ; And I 'm I I hope to be doing very little of it .
Bro014_1213	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_498	Yeah . ; So it 's like ; Right . ; Well we We haven't uncompressed all the meetings ,
Buw001_1587	or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed ; and then we will hav ; Yeah . Then we 'll know . ; We we had I mean ,
Bdb001_1225	So if you have a good , ; um ; But this is exactly what I mean , is that that the problem i ; Yeah .
Bns001_638	And my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here . ; But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind . ; I see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of UMTS know how . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_144	uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . ; We did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things , ; and and , uh , and our things worked too . ; Hmm .
Bro028_1176	I don't know . ; Um , and I 'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see , um , from those patterns ; uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes . ; And maybe maybe some , uh , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um , that the neural net learns .
Bmr010_1265	Um , I th i ; the other , uh the the last w uh , meeting ; eh , I don't know if you remain ; we have problem to with the with with the parameter
Bmr003_647	Right . ; and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , ; which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1329	or , I don't know . ; There are various things that you might w not want to eat a meal there but your own table . ; The Spagos of Heidelberg . ; I think that the h I mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in Japan .
Bed011_214	And the speech people , for example , are gonna do better if they if things come up uh repeatedly . ; Now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting . ; So , all I 'm saying is i th there 's there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish . ; and I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh ,
Bmr020_1067	You know , Wally Chafe says that um , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , uh , that the the what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds . ; Mmm . ; And um , that would be , you know one speaker . ; The discourse the people who look at turn taking often do use
Bmr003_549	Right . ; And this requires humans just like the the STP stuff . ; Yes , ; yeah .
Bns001_1552	it doesn't matter ; I 'm focused on performance evaluation ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_320	just because at the beginning of a call you don't know anything , ; and so you might have some kind of general thing that 's your best guess to start with . ; But ; So , s I I
Bro023_1242	It did seem to help . ; So that you 're right , ; that 's another another way to go . ; How did it compare on I mean , for for good cases where it it uh , stuff that it was trained on ?
Bmr024_323	only a subset of that has been transcribed . ; And so we need to decide what we wanna do . ; And , uh , Liz and Andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . ; And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that .
Bed013_306	Yeah . ; Like I ended up at Blakes last night . ; Non - conducive . ; No .
Bmr022_1175	and don't let anyone check it out ; No , it does not the CVS doesn't work that way . ; Oh , ; it Oh , it doesn't .
Bed013_288	Um , ; Oh ! Questions , ; yeah . ; I 'll ask Eva about the E Bayes and she 's working on that .
Bmr009_1516	Yeah . ; It doesn't display the others . ; It displays just the mixed signal . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_546	so I mean , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . ; Hmm . ; Right , yeah . ; Yeah OK .
Bmr013_235	Um , just take a look . Really . ; H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , uh , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech ; Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , uh , ; well , I don't know , the answers .
Bsr001_629	Mm - hmm . ; At the same time , our process is somehow , you know , getting all this multi - channel information , doing some sort of , you know , cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and transcribing the individual streams , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro003_576	I th I looks the SAMPA SAMPA phone . ; Yeah . ; SAMPA phone ? For English uh American English , and the the the language who have more phone are the English . ; Mmm .
Bed011_978	Yep . ; OK . ; Yep . ; Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when .
Btr001_867	Sh ; And ; Yeah . ; Uh there 's
Bro003_604	Yeah . ; It 's it 's kind of hard . ; There 's not much difference , really . ; And the ones that are gone , I think are I think there was they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop ,
Bed010_716	Mm - hmm . ; So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts . ; But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . ; That , you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up ,
Bro008_327	Yeah . ; This is obviously not usable , ; right ? ; No .
Buw001_1812	Yeah . ; Your grandmother . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_706	So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , ; Yeah . ; but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting ; just go ahead ,
Bed008_1470	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Yeah , but that 's my question , ; like how do we I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E ,
Bmr028_785	There 's a there 's an input stream and an output stream . ; Input reader and an output stream . ; Oh , OK . So then you could use , um You could use , um uh , like Feacalc and s just specify as an output format ; Yeah .
Btr001_1939	but she just is always pleasant . ; You know , ; and it 's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs ; Yes .
Bmr025_319	Mm - hmm . ; It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the " include " files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . ; Right . ; So I it might be a little easier
Bmr030_180	I 'm sorry ? ; How much memory does he have ? ; I don't know , ; but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all .
Bmr002_1338	Exactly . ; Exactly . ; Anything else ? ; Well , so , um
Bed004_506	Good . ; Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place ; and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " . ; So this is just based on this one um , on this one feature ,
Buw001_445	That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . ; Maybe Landay can put a student in to be a note - taker . ; I th ; No .
Bro017_618	which is , like , " imagine that you will you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power . ; In some what ? ; General pow power . ; Like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something .
Bmr014_1116	OK . ; Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says " you 'll be given an opportunity . " ; OK . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1648	Yeah . OK . ; Yeah . ; Well , sometimes when you crank up the visual all it gives you is the background speakers . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_766	Based on the ; Uh - huh . ; because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , ; Well , training , and validation . Sure .
Bro022_417	Two point seven . ; I know in the meeting , like ; On the meeting we have two point seven . ; Right .
Bdb001_1356	Right . ; Yeah , exactly . ; But it could be that they just uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff , ; Right ,
Bed003_499	That 's true . ; but it doesn't have question mark because it 's extracted . ; Yeah . ; OK , I see your point .
Bro003_304	Mmm . ; Because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set . ; Right ? ; And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training .
Bro004_443	No . ; See , I thought you showed me something like that last week . ; You had a you had a little ; Uh , No , I don't think so .
Bed006_561	and ; you can speak into it and ask for TV and movie information ; Toll . ; and then when
Bro004_583	the uh the um networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits , ; Aurora - two . ; mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1043	So we make up cases that have these features , ; OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , " OK , here 's a bunch of cases " ; There 're even ones tha that you can do learning ; OK ? So you have all their cases and and their results
Bsr001_763	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then you have room to port whatever you can to , you know , smaller devices .
Bmr003_1614	because I figured there 's a limited number , ; and I keep them to a uh , limited set ; because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , you know , versus " um " . ; So I just always wrote it as U M .
Bro018_887	So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So ,
Bro028_606	Is that about right you think ? ; Uh , we don't know yet , I I think . ; Really , we don't know ? ; Uh - huh .
Bmr025_115	So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? ; We have two tools that have already been written . ; Um the SoftSound guys did a web - based one , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_30	because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item ; and now we have two . ; So . And , uh . ; OK .
Bmr020_1231	Yeah . ; And then um , the transcriber , instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything . ; OK ? ; Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , the tra They focus on the dominant speaker
Bmr013_533	just it came up . ; It 'd be very interesting though , to have that data . ; Yeah . ; I wonder , how would you do a forced alignment ?
Bed003_707	Oh , I see , ; you may have a task . ; wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . ; Mmm .
Bed008_449	So are they the is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ? ; Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are . ; Oh I just created it , it has none so far . ; Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects ,
Bmr008_1574	And it will i i it will say something like zero ; Uh - huh . ; or you know it 'll have something that it says when it 's when it can't find a good good uh uh period , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr019_968	Uh - huh . ; Is that what you 're talking about ? ; Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was ? ; That was fixed , um , before
Bns001_1720	This gets rid of the SDH . ; Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first ; Yeah . ; ATM stuff .
Bro012_1298	and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net ; Mm - hmm . ; we used we d did some of this stuff . ; Uh I I did , some years ago ,
Bmr003_1677	I didn't explain it well . ; If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yes .
Buw001_413	I mean , your research is going to be very circular . ; Yeah , that that 's what I was saying . ; Yeah . ; But th there is this , um There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time
Bmr001_493	The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now . ; Yeah . ; And just not bother . ; So it 's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and figuring out where it goes .
Bed010_28	Am Spartacus . " ; " I am Sm - I am Smarticus " is what it 's saying . ; Verstehe . ; Right .
Bmr016_999	Right . ; The other thing is that , believe it or not I mean , we have some ; but . ; Yeah and they don't .
Bed010_266	And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff . ; Wa ; uh ; To some de
Bsr001_1938	Because we need we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand . ; So it 's it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task . ; Oh , I I uh ; sure , sure , sure , sure .
Btr001_1251	Oh , OK , ; yeah , then I 'm doing that right now . ; Right . ; Oh , right ,
Btr001_1016	Oh , really ? ; and it 's predictable apparently , ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_513	which is really weird . ; Wow . ; I didn't realize that . ; OK .
Bed011_424	It feels like a long time ; but . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1192	Yeah . ; But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . ; You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much . ; Right .
Bmr012_367	Well so I guess we can generate ; Sounds likes ? ; Mm - hmm . ; There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .
Bmr028_209	Or audio file . ; Well , actually the audio files are pretty fast , too . ; for presentation in , uh Uh I wouldn't be ; Yeah .
Bsr001_407	Fascinating ! ; Wow . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1005	so I think Hynek will be here Monday . ; Monday or Tuesday . ; So ; Uh , yeah .
Bed010_244	OK . ; Makes sense . ; But any so that e e ; It 's clear , then , I think .
Bmr031_750	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's what I meant , ; Well , they have the two gig already .
Bmr016_1309	but I have here , ; now we 're about to get to the to this now , ; I have frequencies . ; So you 'll see how often these different things occur .
Bsr001_473	It was pretty bad . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It takes off quite a lot .
Btr002_2187	and other things like that . ; Right . ; And you get so much more aware of all of it too . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe .
Bro017_1038	Go fishing . ; See how many cycles we used ? ; Yeah . ; Then you are sort of in this mode like all of those ARPA people are ,
Bed015_1877	Anyway , so so , um , I guess ; uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , ; which is that , um , ; it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions .
Buw001_2299	OK . ; OK . ; I think we 're done . ; OK .
Bmr016_1368	and she just didn't listen ; so she didn't know . ; We just we 're waiting on that just to do the alignments . ; Yeah .
Bed015_263	Yeah . ; Yeah yeah . ; And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . ; Right .
Bmr011_1060	Um , the problem is if we have no time marks , ; then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . ; And so ; Oh , I see ,
Bed013_844	Someone 's gonna start making Phil Collins jokes . ; Yeah . ; Hmm ? ; Sorry .
Bmr023_974	Oh , yeah . ; But but , I guess my my point was that that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways . ; and and an ; Y
Bro015_223	I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder what they did about ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states .
Bro026_994	Yeah . ; But but but we 're not trying for models of words here . ; See , so her here 's maybe where ; If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough
Bed016_593	I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free . ; Oh , nothing is context - free , ; but there are basic cases . ; That is , um , there are physical containers ,
Bro028_378	Uh - huh . ; and then when you re - synthesize with LPC - twelve it went to five . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed003_426	So ; Right ? ; Right , ; so it 's not really all of context .
Bmr010_1398	it 's just it 's just a isn't it just a Gaussian ; for each ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1125	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; So y you do have to compute the KL transformation .
Bed015_1688	which can change . ; Mm - hmm , ; And we need all the same machinery . ; right .
Bro004_456	Ratio . ; No . No . ; The upper part is for TI - digits ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Btr001_532	What 's going on right now ? " ; Especially when they 're when you were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes . ; It 's kind of ; Oh .
Bmr014_226	But anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW . ; So . ; Um . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , ; uh , radio - mikes .
Bmr008_845	you know uh ; so ; But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get , ; but we could say uh " where did you live before you were five ? " ,
Bro017_1045	but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company ; and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer . ; Uh - huh . ; So after two hours uh the visitor said " wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? "
Btr001_874	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that is true .
Bro011_503	what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; OK .
Bro016_1076	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; That 's not based on , you know , acoustic data . ; OK .
Bmr022_443	That also appeals to me . So that you don't have to , you know ; Yeah . ; That 's a good idea . ; Very simple .
Bro027_671	Right . ; Well , so you say ; And ; let 's say ten milliseconds seconds for the LDA .
Bed006_1711	So . ; Yeah . And and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy ; in the sense that um ultimately one ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_151	Just with with age , kind of . ; With age . Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; But , uh , that 's not d directly related to me .
Bro005_1302	I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e ; What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , ; Mmm . ; presumably uh , in a in a day we could turn around
Bmr018_749	so so there are some things available , ; and I don't know too much about this area ; where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them , ; and it should work pretty well if you took care of this recording time difference .
Bed016_1110	Oh geez . ; Anyway , I 'm sorry . ; But I think the argument should be uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , ; because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical ,
Btr002_1589	And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , ; and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever , ; or ; You know ?
Bro004_1222	And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . ; But they 've been looking at uh at these issues . ; At the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . ; And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at
Bro024_588	This whole page is TI - digits ; Yeah . ; Oh ; or this is ?
Bro003_1229	but on what machine ? ; On a SPERT board . ; Uh . ; I I think the neural net SPERT .
Bsr001_856	Of the speaker ID or something ? ; This i ; Eh , right , speaker verification . ; And what 's the what wha So what has the data been ?
Bmr022_42	because that was th always the error , is that they put in it extraneous beeps . ; Hmm . ; But it 's not easy to do , ; because the whole thing gets offset ,
Bmr020_1148	with uh ; And I had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , ; we went through uh EDU - one , at some extent . ; And it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file ,
Buw001_1644	I personally only want text data . ; I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now ; But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . ; But I think all he would want is the digits .
Bmr029_778	That was in the Hub - five small training set ? ; Well , the Hub - five small training set contains as much Macrophone as the large training set , for historical reasons . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bro017_570	Uh - huh . ; I think it 's about right . ; Yeah , because it de it depends on the weightings ; and
Bro025_159	Compared to the last evaluation numbers ? Yeah . ; But , uh ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1458	And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all . ; Right . ; Right , but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1079	So , which one do you prefer ? ; Is it is it the So , if we had a show of hands , how many people would vote for the SUN keyboard versus the ; OK . ; So let 's put it the other way .
Btr002_3246	So , if so in the examp i in the instance in which ; Let 's say that , um , Morgan 's talking , ; uh , so , he 's talking . ; And then somewhere there 's a bit of a pause ,
Bmr012_194	I 'm puzzled by that . ; I oh oh , I see . ; There 's there 's a ; Oh there was a glitch somewhere .
Bed006_218	OK . ; yeah . ; Now , i ; Don't worry ,
Bed012_10	Um . I don't know . ; There were , like , the you know , @ @ and all that stuff . ; But . I thought you you said you were adding stuff ; but I don't know .
Bmr003_2574	so if I 'm gonna do ; No . ; It 's a joke . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_595	So , ; So ; Huh . ; uh .
Bro022_1046	So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , ; so I 'm not going to change it that much . ; But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit . ; So , that h
Btr001_2699	Huh . ; one or the other . ; I see , ; so that 's why .
Bmr002_1362	Yeah . ; and then I think I 'll ; also uh a Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few . ; So , I 'll uh try to get those as well .
Bro024_664	which is like a different initialization for the , uh , s transition probabilities . ; It 's just that right now , the initialization is to stay more in the current state , ; which is point four point six , right ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1208	Right ? ; If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and , uh ; But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . ; That 's what I 'm worried about .
Bro010_683	Well , it 's there is ; you you have to center the window , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed008_962	It things don't converge , yeah . ; uh R recursive action ? ; you just you have to ; there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't
Bdb001_1202	W - diff or diff . ; There 's the , uh , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs f based on the same original . ; Yeah . ; Is it S - diff ?
Bmr013_490	It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it ; Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1308	Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . ; Mm - hmm . ; Nuh ? ; but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .
Bro014_1019	Yeah . ; I mean , I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT ; and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad . ; Uh , so it would s
Bmr005_1325	what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff . ; Need the close - talking mikes . ; You do , OK . ; I mean , absolutely ,
Bro017_543	So . But this is being now discussed right now , ; and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement .
Bmr006_1122	eh What , I I mean , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with ; Well , I think that would be an interesting result . ; N u We ; Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable .
Bed002_370	Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . ; I 'll have to go back and check . ; Not important . ; So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is .
Bmr014_588	as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; and so she she will try that I think
Bmr006_902	" Tone " , whatever . ; so so on because I have a pitch extractor yet . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_888	You could affect Theoretically you could affect " doing business " with " has door " . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr011_1774	Yeah , ; right . Exactly . ; energy . ; I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop
Bmr007_823	and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; And then I median - filtered that using , um a fairly long filter length .
Bed005_1076	So The idea is that , each of these EI is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? ; So , for example , suppose that the person I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . ; But none of the other sort of cues really apply . ; Then , this would be
Bmr019_455	So , where were we ? ; Uh Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Digits .
Bro023_1436	Yeah . ; So ; But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency . ; And the last frame doesn't have any latency .
Bmr026_191	So hopefully that will work . ; Really ? ; So is that ; Because there 's some people um
Btr002_1292	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's very clear . ; You know what the canani canonical answer is when a person says a number ,
Btr002_2470	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; People talk about , you know , " Oh gee , that was really good , " ; Mmm .
Bro022_637	Ye ; with the SRI system , ; I ; I 'm sorry .
Bed005_366	Uh . I can't find it now . ; You mean , where the where the act how the action " Goodbye " maps into something ; Yeah . ; Yeah , where are those constructors defined ?
Bmr006_558	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro019_1362	Moments , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro011_654	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And uh ; And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point ,
Bmr020_1149	And I had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , ; we went through uh EDU - one , at some extent . ; And it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , ; we had some discussion over the weekend a about at at this other meeting that we were all a at
Btr002_858	Yeah . Ooh ! ; It was very weird . ; Mmm . ; But .
Bro014_1138	Mm - hmm . ; and so if we if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , we have something that 's close to the excitation signal . ; Oh . ; OK .
Bmr012_1318	and then um the third part would ; and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST ; and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards ; so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say
Bmr008_425	OK . ; I mean , that 's why I put it there , s ; Then ; OK .
Bed014_761	No , no . We 've got a lot we 've got a lot of theses going . ; There 's a few of us around now . ; Now it 's not . Yay ! ; I know it is .
Bns002_984	because of the of high interference levels . ; A lot of simultaneous transmissions also means for each receiver point of view , a lot of neighbors or or nodes transmitting at the same time . ; And , all the transmitters uh with the exception of the transmitter of my transmitter , are my intereferers ; and are and all of them are producing less quality reception ,
Bmr024_169	I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Some latency or something .
Bed013_1331	and why would anyone care about location , ; if not , you know ; Mmm . ; and so forth .
Bro010_527	Yeah . ; Or ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's I mean , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s uh , spectral subtraction methods .
Bmr014_364	I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . ; Yeah . ; So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , ; or something of
Bro023_158	and and just design a filter . ; And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior ; and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_864	We could always put more disks on . ; Yeah . ; It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci ; It 's the back - up system .
Btr001_2776	we just start out , we and you s you say , " transcript L " whatever it is , ; and then launch into the numbers ; and then pause between the gr the gaps ; Sure .
Bed016_167	Yeah , ; But , anyway . ; um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d ; Oh . Oh , sorry .
Btr002_1796	It 's not s it 's not a " dong " . ; It 's not a ; I mean , you there 're all these words that I could imagine ; and so , it 's like , it 's a " tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop " .
Bro007_124	For this one . ; So filt is what that is ? ; Filt , yeah ; Yeah .
Bed015_1647	uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff . ; No , that 's horrible . ; OK . ; That 's horrible . OK .
Bed004_397	So , you could imagine ; w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something . ; Well I OK , I just ; Say what you were gonna say .
Bed005_875	So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that . ; I mean , that would just be a t a um ; Or , as a matter of fact , we need and if we if we ' r eh take a ten year perspective , we need to do that , ; because
Bmr020_1266	And then meanwhile , she 's listening to both of these guys ' channels , ; determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed003_235	and what they 've said previously and whatnot . ; And then we have the means that they should use . ; Right ? ; but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that
Bmr029_739	Yeah . ; Cuz we still all have tha the that other one going , ; which is the , uh the Macrophone training . ; Right ,
Bmr022_675	We have to ask them . ; I think it would help them keep the track track of it . ; Uh uh , again , especially if there 's hundred many hundreds or thousands I still think it would it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files . ; Interesting ,
Bsr001_1955	I see . ; So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ? ; I guess ; It 's all up to when I have free time .
Buw001_399	th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . ; Well , it doesn't have to be . ; OK . So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , ; which is for someone else ,
Bmr003_2152	How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? ; Because they 're there . ; Well , OK , ; let me rephrase that .
Bmr010_782	Mm - hmm . ; My my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fan fantastic to ; Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr029_749	Now , is that the long training set there ? ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's everything . Yeah , ; OK .
Bns003_325	yeah , it depends on how much time you have . ; And then the page for inf about ; So , some information for people who are new comers or , ; I don't know a good word for it ,
Bmr020_1777	Yeah . ; Oh , I s ; background laptop or , background LT wouldn't take any time . ; Sure ,
Bed015_1753	I couldn't really remember what it meant ; so I took it out . ; Yeah . ; But it 's something
Bed008_346	Less likely to enter . ; some , ; uh I was thinking less likely to view ; yeah .
Bsr001_755	Right . ; I mean , the the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance . ; And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get any better . ; That 's right ,
Bsr001_1602	But these are all components that are obvious to us how to build . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Nothing nothing that 's sort of far in the future . ; Mmm .
Bdb001_694	but let 's as ; Well , it 's definitely true with the segment . ; Right . ; That 's what I exactly what I meant by the utterances versus the sentence could be sort of
Bmr009_1465	Yep , just which one . ; I think that 's fine . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1476	Right . ; So . ; Anyway . ; OK .
Bed008_1237	Put it in your , ; yeah . ; I guess this board works fine . ; So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node .
Bed005_1324	and ; right now . ; The reason is , given the craw bet uh , the the the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history , they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects , ; and that 's , uh , uh , sort of a tough cookie ,
Bns001_299	Yeah . ; Because you just have to license , uh uh WaveLAN technology . ; You can build , uh , the whole thing . ; Yeah ,
Bed005_498	Yeah , OK . ; No , right , the Discourse Maintainer , ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bro028_649	and So . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , it makes a big difference . ; If you change your front - end , you know , the scale is completely can be completely different ,
Bro013_453	Yeah . ; So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_120	Yeah . ; Yeah , I just uh I just was abbreviated it to Struct in my head , and started going with that . ; That element or object , I would say . ; Not a C Struct . That 's not what I was trying to k
Bmr008_1665	What do you look at in order to normalize ? ; I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is , how do you how do you W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it by ? ; Yeah . ; And and uh , that 's that 's something to think about and experiment with .
Bmr008_1348	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence , it 's also going to be a smaller fraction . ; This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing .
Bed012_293	and we get a certain We have a Situation vector and a User vector and everything is fine ? ; An - an and and our and our ; Did you just sti Did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea ? ; No .
Bmr016_118	and it seems like that might be better for you guys ; since then you 'll have just more digit data , ; Right . ; and that 's always a good thing .
Bed015_1338	Well that 's ; or " Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed . ; And , like , well , I don't you know , it was like " hope , wish . desire " , ; Right .
Bro027_1977	I 'm talking about next week . ; I 'm leaving leaving next Wednesday . ; Uh - huh . ; This afternoon uh
Bmr018_941	or just say it 's just put " X , " you know , like " not speech " or something , ; and then you can get ; I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly , ; Yeah , or
Bed017_602	Yeah . ; No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed . ; It was ; Yeah .
Bro021_1314	So this is twenty or something ? ; Twenty - three . ; Twenty ? ; So it 's
Buw001_586	and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . ; Yeah . ; You just get together and talk about where you are . ; Right .
Bmr022_881	OK . Then I will just go do that , ; Yeah . ; and send the bill to uh , ; Whoever will pay ,
Bed005_766	Yeah . ; Right . ; O or or tower , or this tower , or that building , or ; Uniquely .
Bed008_276	which where you end up at the end ; but the part the good part is walking over it , ; so . ; That 's subtle , but true .
Bro019_1179	Well . ; and to to concat this new feature . ; But the result are ; n with the neural network I have more or less the same result .
Bro014_930	So the question is , what characterization ; and you 're playing around with this ; another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ? ; So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference ,
Bmr020_1888	Yeah . ; But ; Oh , interesting . ; Comparable ,
Buw001_802	Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , ; Did they store it digitally , ; but ; or ?
Bed002_823	So the GPS is crashed as well . ; So the person first has to ask you " Where are you ? " . ; And so you have to do some s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . ; Um , this is a a a a a bit that I d I don't think we
Bsr001_1646	OK . ; Right . ; Understood . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1603	Maybe . ; I think so , ; Maybe . ; yeah .
Bro024_187	Huh . ; but it might make a difference . ; I don't know . ; Uh , yeah ,
Bmr016_856	So , ; the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal ; because disks don't crash very frequently , ; Right .
Btr001_1696	Yeah , ; you 're about to s speak . ; which I feel is important ; Uh
Bmr003_1864	So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web . ; OK , ; now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech . ; Yes .
Bed009_554	Mmm . ; And even on on a more basic level the the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures . ; Hmm ? ; And not just um say um um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states and th these states really are fixed in in a certain sense .
Bed004_562	No . ; And ; this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um ; we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .
Bro003_714	Yeah . ; right ? ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_15	Anyway ; Oh , ; so there you go . ; Anyway , so my idea f for today
Bmr019_790	Mm - hmm . ; I looked at them . ; I spent two days um , in Waves ; OK .
Bmr009_263	Uh - huh . ; Um But since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_950	But I can't ; Yeah . ; that th he has these little chuckles as he talks . ; Yeah . OK .
Bro023_1545	So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds , ; Ah . ; OK . ; and then I look for the minima ,
Bmr015_996	which is , um , how to handle breaths . ; So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . ; And the reason I ask the question is , ; um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode ,
Btr001_2387	It 's possible . ; So you meant just sort of like a just a normal " uh " ? ; It 's just a normal " uh " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_221	and I I show you what I do , ; Mm - hmm . ; I speak into it and you hear it talk , ; OK .
Bed015_1829	but but , um , it does seem that , ; you know , this is this is coming along . ; I think it 's it 's converging . ; It 's as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do
Bro011_174	Yeah . ; Uh . ; OK . ; So there 's um
Bro010_658	right ? ; So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz . ; Yeah , ; I mean , good good luck .
Bed015_339	That I I have no problem with it at all . ; It - it ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1523	But , uh , ; are you saying ; So I don't know where you 're ; Stephane , where you 're doing your computations .
Bmr006_552	Yeah . ; One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow .
Bmr027_854	No , no . You can do that . ; Right ? ; You know , you can put this button anywhere you want , ; Oh ?
Bed011_390	Oh , we could get ; I mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , ; right ? ; I mean it 's it 's not like
Bns003_48	I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box , ; and I 'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box . ; But wh wh wh what are the box ? ; A box is a s P C .
Bro028_373	Oh , oh . OK , ; Mm - hmm . ; and make it closer to what to what we 're seeing as the feature vectors . ; I see .
Bmr003_1955	It 's obviously not true . ; No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes . ; Right . ; The question is what is what 's he looked at .
Bed005_205	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , wow . ; Um , I mean , these sentences are just silly . ; Hmm .
Buw001_386	One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . ; Mm - hmm . ; So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . ; So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .
Bro005_1089	So . ; So we So . First thing of course we 'd wanna do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . ; Without putting in a second path . ; Uh . You mean
Bed014_385	Oh , another thing , ; um ; there was this , uh thing that Nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that ; Hmm !
Bed013_562	Yeah . ; OK , so it 's a little thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bmr015_1017	Uh - uh . ; We - See , we 're we 're dealing with real speech ; and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible ; Yeah .
Bed015_452	I hate this thing . ; Sorry . ; Um , which is , ; so something like " past " which i you know , we think is a very simple uh , we 've often just stuck it in as a feature ,
Bsr001_485	There 's just no other way around it . ; Somebody will design a comfortable close talking mike . ; I mean it 's there are too many applications to for them not to not do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_560	So that 's not as good as the one up above . ; No . ; But the fifty is better than the one up above , ; Yeah .
Bed011_545	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm also interested in th in this " property " uh line here , ; so if you look at sorry , look at that ; um , timing was um I have these three .
Bmr008_1788	but eh I I I have the same codes in different parts , ; Anyway , ; and uh I I had to to to change all all the points in the in the code , eh to substitute eh for another way , ; Yep .
Bed006_770	Right ? ; that doesn't hurt the current way . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_858	This this is the idea the idea I I I had ; to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum ; and try to get a ratio to to distinguish between overlapping and speech . ; Mmm .
Bmr015_1044	but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus . ; Yeah . ; OK , then the then I have two questions . ; So so mean you 're right
Bro003_1852	SAMPA ? ; What does " SAMPA " mean ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_59	Yeah . ; he 'll t he 'll probably be interested . ; But . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_414	So you can ; right , so you can ; Yeah . ; So , hang on
Bed006_1749	It happened to c be what it stands for . ; Well ; It just happened to be the acronym . ; Yeah . That 's doesn't make it a great term .
Bed010_405	he 's not gonna do that . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that ,
Bmr008_985	How ; yeah ? ; How long have you been in an English speaking country . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_282	But maybe the ; So so you see how Jane 's wearing it ? ; Mmm . ; That seems to work OK too .
Bed003_530	Yeah . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Um .
Bmr030_71	It 's ; Yeah . ; Higher level , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_637	And the energy is not eh height ; eh I think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is mmm bigger eh eh eh compared with the with the overlapping eh duration , ; Mm - hmm . ; eh the effect is mmm stronger
Bmr010_1097	But having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , uh , funding . ; Wonderful . ; And then school will start in in the sixt on the sixteenth . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_302	Is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this . ; No , it wouldn't . ; It would be considered as an overlap in the first one . ; OK , so that 's good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question ,
Bro018_293	But noisy TIMIT ? ; Noisy TIMIT . ; Right . ; We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the the TI - digits .
Bmr013_622	OK . ; And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1417	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; I I 'm not sure what wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other . ; But
Bro019_80	Um . ; I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , ; so that people in the group know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1107	And they 're generally extremely good , ; but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check ; and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance ; cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there .
Bed005_1116	Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life . ; I ; yeah . ; I I think so , yeah .
Bro017_736	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know the the the the component which I I mean di dimension wh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_513	Mm - hmm . ; And so , ; uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1661	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Well , also , I mean , I I I suspect that it may we may not be able to get anywhere without doing something ,
Buw001_387	Mm - hmm . ; So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . ; So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_155	Oh . ; And I haven't told you ; cuz I haven't I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet . ; Right .
Bns001_1513	Then then is something available ; but I don't know ; you know , I 'm not an application expert , ; I
Btr001_1284	I didn't either . ; Oh , that 's helpful . ; I found them to be just ; I just I I ended up basically redoing them .
Bro018_331	to know exactly what they are doing ; because maybe that we can have some ideas ; Mm - hmm . ; but not only to read the proposal .
Bed003_539	I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . ; So . Um . ; that 's always warping on something some entity , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1564	and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random , ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; and it did pick out pretty good boundaries .
Bro004_816	but you have more classes ; so you you have more information in your features . ; So , Um You have more information in the uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_1018	uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , ; but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it .
Bro014_1244	So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , you get something closer to that . ; This is less it 's less robust . ; Less robust . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1225	I who who 's the person in charge ? ; Who 's gonna be the Steve here ? ; You ? ; I hope it 's Jane .
Bmr003_272	that 's right . ; Right , ; but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC ; and what does that mean to what we 've done already ?
Bro004_535	and the and the result was quite poor . ; What I we hadn't seen yet was that if you added in the English , it 's still poor . ; Yeah . ; Uh Um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data
Bed014_679	Yeah . But that 's ; I mean this this function , ; so , has the current object been mentioned in in with a question about concerning its ; No , no . It 's it It goes the other d it goes in the other direction .
Buw001_1310	It 's gonna take some thought . ; I mean , ; It seemed The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1175	It 's it 's on the order of eight to ten . ; I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate . ; I think . ; But I 'm not sure .
Bmr016_1912	Something like that ; maybe , yeah . ; Well , that 'd qualify . ; On the glosses for numbers ,
Bmr023_182	uh , doing ; Anyway . Yeah . ; Good . ; Yeah .
Bns003_480	Yeah , we can do that . ; Yes , also fine . ; We then create a link and then we have to ask with Jane , ; Yeah .
Bed003_737	OK . ; Right now we haven't observed it , ; so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_432	So . ; Huh ! ; Now you could set up multiple windows , each one with a different signal showing , and then look between the windows . ; Maybe that 's the solution .
Bro015_49	And and i when they 're talking about it , do you have the impression that they 're talking about a particular VAD which everybody would use ? ; or or just that everybody would use the same procedure ? ; Well , probably uh s the same VAD for everybody . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1261	The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing . ; Right . ; So ; Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech .
Bro008_228	yeah ; just with the missing columns filled in . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_242	Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on ; uh ; well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement . ; Uh , and the fact is that for right now for the English , they have weights
Bed006_686	Mm - hmm . ; and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions . ; And then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary . ; So a push may be in in in both you know push uh in this or this
Bed016_1071	Oh , you can do that ? ; Really ? ; Of course that 's that that 's definitely a , uh ; Fixed .
Bro014_228	I have no idea . ; or ? ; Oh , you don't know . ; Mmm , I just
Bed011_551	What 's this idea of " next tour " ? ; I mean ; It 's sort of next day , ; so you 're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things ,
Btr002_903	yeah . ; I do it all on the keyboard . ; Oh . ; OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse .
Bdb001_999	so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f ; Yep . ; Most of the tools can handle that . ; So that
Bmr030_531	So when that thing When it stutters like that , is it because there 's a delay getting the data off a disk ? Or is it because there 's a delay in the D to A ? ; Mm - hmm . ; It could be either . ; I mean , there are lots of different places .
Bmr016_2232	Yeah . ; I mean I 'm sure about that , ; but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done , ; or when you expect them to finish it , or
Bro019_1048	Um , ; well we 've ; Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . ; But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News .
Bed010_914	good . ; and uh , it 's a and still , I think , you know , get something done . ; Cool ! ; But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , is real hard .
Btr001_503	Some people tend to mumble , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1036	Mm - hmm . ; and we extend these coefficient between the all the frequency range . ; Mm - hmm . ; And i the interpolation i between the point is give for the triang triangular filter , the value of the triangular filter
Bro005_716	So So - Let me bef before you go on to the possible issues . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , on the MSG uh problem ; um , I think that in in the um , in the short time solution
Bed013_1126	Yeah , it should be So we have ; um , ; i let 's assume we we call something like a loc - X node and a path - X node . ; And what we actually get if we just look at the discourse , " where is X " should activate
Bmr010_139	And I did some pre - segmentations for for Jane . ; And I 'm not sure how good they are or what what the transcribers say . ; They they can use it ; or ?
Bsr001_1498	You 're double miking everyone , ; so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes , ; A g ; Two of @ @ .
Bmr016_345	Oh I see . ; that 's not fair to use " . ; Oh yeah that 's true , absolutely . ; But , it might be fair to use the data for adaptation ,
Bmr023_985	One experiment we should we 'll probably need to do though when um , at some point , is , since we 're using that same the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain , ; Right ? ; But . ; Well , that 's what I meant , in fact . Yeah .
Bed014_1433	It 's almost true . ; Oh , I don't have it this weekend , ; so , tsk don't have to worry about that . ; Mmm .
Bro003_388	because then you can say when ; because surely someone is going to say at some point , " OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish . ; Mmm . ; Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? "
Bed013_483	is is it normally like like , dialogue systems , or , you know , other NLP - ish things ? ; No no no no no no no no . It 's it 's like a ; Oh , it 's cognitive . ; OK .
Bro010_806	it can be shorter than that . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; Well , I 've I 've talked to some of you already .
Bro019_1652	yeah , you 're going back today ; and then back in a week I guess , ; and . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_243	overlaps are , uh , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , ; and as might be desired I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we don't have start and end points at each point where there 's an overlap .
Bmr002_1390	It really makes you feel like you 're doing real work ; when you get all this hardware . ; Well , this is , I mean , compared to the way people normally do , like , discourse stuff ? ; you know , it 's like you got your
Bro010_942	uh , ; i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . ; So , um , ; um , we don't really know how those should be labeled .
Btr001_1728	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1472	Uh , ; but a hundred is a lot . ; And and , uh , um ; OK .
Bmr002_498	I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that . ; Yeah . ; She 's really She 's done Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_147	Six AM in front . ; OK . ; Uh , I 'll be here . ; Uh I 'll I 'll I 'll I 'll give you my phone number ,
Bmr028_800	So . ; Great . ; So , then it 's t uh , tandem experiments after that ? ; Uh - huh .
Bmr023_545	i if they 've agreed to that . ; Well , I forget how we end ; Right . I forget how we ended up on this , ; but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything
Bmr003_687	There 's some interesting human factors problems like , yeah , what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly . ; Cuz then , you know , you get like if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . ; Yeah . ; But then you have to take the time to mark it .
Bro007_10	and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . ; And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh another MLP ; and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT . ; Um the output is used as uh features as well .
Bmr009_923	So the main thing that the person fills out um is the name and email and time ? ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Ah !
Bed013_1171	Is that ? ; That 's exactly what we 're looking for . ; OK . OK . ; I d I just I don't like having characterizing the constructions with location and path ,
Bmr003_2490	Yeah . ; But that does mean so we can use that as well . ; Well , uh , the certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether you you can get compatible stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_644	Um , someone deleted something somewhere . ; And so we have some room again . ; And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , ; so , you know , we have a couple weeks .
Bmr025_128	Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News ; Yeah . ; which I think looks great . ; I think that 's a nice demo .
Bro014_520	but w which would be a much better baseline . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if we look at the result that Sunil sent , just putting the VAD in the baseline improved , like , more than twenty percent , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_958	This if I were to ; Yeah . ; if I were to add an option , it might be to have an undo for that . ; Yeah . Yeah !
Btr001_1970	and it 's not nice ? " ; I started like kind of making mental friends . ; Uh - huh . ; I 'm just like , " I really like that person .
Btr001_724	I thought ; Um , so . ; I mean , I usually ended adjusting them a little bit ; Yeah .
Bed002_714	So , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry , ; except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . ; So our job is to figure out how to solve these problems . ; If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that .
Bmr011_579	You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go ; since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , ; um , and just have this other information available . ; So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure
Bro005_298	I 'm I 'm all better now . ; OK , go ahead . ; So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . ; Yeah .
Bed005_649	um ; Mmm . ; tu uh , tur change the description to , uh , English ; OK .
Bmr019_846	U uh ; and it 's it 's in the ; well , Jane and I were just in terms of the tool , talking about this . ; I guess Sue had had some reactions .
Bmr014_158	So let 's see we ; So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six . ; Right ? ; So we could have up to nine .
Bro007_485	because I I think ; Except if if it 's the thirty - one at midnight ; uh Uh ; or I don't know
Bro027_928	Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible , ; but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had , ; except it was noisier . ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_586	Yeah , ; some @ @ . ; right ? ; Right .
Bro003_748	Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on . ; OK ? ; OK . ; Um , for the training corpus corpus , um , we have , um , the the d digits from the various languages .
Bed003_983	OK . ; Right . ; But uh it 's free . ; Which is w quite positive ,
Bro005_971	not uh again a short - term sort of thing . ; Yeah . ; I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's ; e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth .
Bmr027_1450	I thought we did . ; Did we ? ; Yeah . We did . ; OK .
Bed015_1684	And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . ; And so , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space
Bmr011_1147	So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , ; just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of uh , parameters f on the recognizer , ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz that would be helpful .
Bmr003_2550	So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? ; Uh , y yeah . ; We we need to figure out what we want . ; Great .
Btr001_880	Or just leave it as , " fascinating " ? ; What I 've done I 've ; It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_154	Oh , OK , ; yeah , so , that is what I wanted to know . ; Yeah . ; I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess .
Bmr007_101	uh , you know y this is just eh eh , this would this is not statistically verified , but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being localized to a particular region . ; The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of of , um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to code stress , uh , sentence stress as possible indication of , uh information retrieval . ; So it 's like , you know , rather , lively discussion there . ; What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?
Bmr006_898	Sorry . ; And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . ; Right . ; And my idea is
Bmr014_475	I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . ; Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , ; and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the you know , uh enumerated , or i ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_48	Yeah . ; With with whatever it was , a month and a half or something ahead of time , the only time we could find in common roughly in common , was on a Saturday . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr001_171	but ; Yeah . ; So . ; I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still , which is um ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets ,
Bmr028_613	The longer is better . ; It 's just when there is when they are sequentially and ; There 's there 's th ; Mm - hmm . OK . Sure .
Bdb001_363	Which is fine , ; but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files . ; Right . ; I mean , we could do it .
Bmr022_715	but but Don had told me that there 's a difference in some of the conventions ? ; Oh . Yes . But this is not important . ; So but those are all easy things , ; It 's systematic ,
Buw001_2189	You can tell by the prosody . ; Yeah . ; We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? ; Oh .
Bro021_24	for today ? ; No ? ; OK . ; So why don't we just around and people can give updates .
Bmr028_1779	Mm - hmm . ; Hey , I 've never done one of those . ; Oh , you never have ? ; Oh , it 's a treat .
Btr001_252	And the German speakers I found a little bit easier , ; Yeah . ; and I thought maybe that was because I had I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German , ; Oh .
Buw001_1229	Right . ; and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , ; or or a deeper ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1634	That 's a fine idea . ; Yeah , ; OK . ; Well , what 's that mean ?
Bmr006_1643	but we haven't specified to them ; So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what ; I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . ; We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case .
Bmr029_768	Um ; Wel - No , it is . ; Th - the ; Sorry .
Bns001_1069	And in the Netherlands , it is also available . ; Mmm . ; every provider provides ; In Spain it 's available
Bro023_981	Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; And , yeah , ; some people also if it 's a negative value they , uh , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the edges and bins .
Bro021_1113	OK . So now once you get that that one , then you then you do a first or second - order , or something , Taylor series expansion of this . ; Yeah . ; This is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s Taylor series . ; Yeah , sure .
Btr002_839	Yeah . ; You know ? ; That 's true . ; I think that would be useful .
Bro023_1269	yeah , I mean , we 'll just have to try it . ; But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some . ; I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same , ; but I would imagine it would help some .
Btr001_2208	Or at least that 's what I found . ; What do you mean ? ; Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something either a new topic or a different take on the same topic will tend to use will trail off with " so " . ; Oh .
Bro018_1190	Hmm . ; Cuz I I it 's cuz I don't know what log magnitude spectral subtraction is gonna do to additive noise . ; Yeah , ; well , it 's it 's not exactly the right thing
Bro023_1371	you know , maybe you could make it twenty - five . ; Yeah . ; You know what I mean ? ; Oh yes .
Btr002_2329	even though maybe it 's several seconds later , there 's no glitch in the syntax or anything . ; It 's We 're pretty amazing machines . ; Or creatures , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_959	So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them . ; Well , if if if you if they last ; Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case , ; and and occasionally you might need to recreate one ,
Bro013_227	So the three point four percent for this uh is is ; uh ; So why is it ; It 's an interesting question though , still .
Bed008_137	he is he cheap , average , or spendy ? ; Alright . ; And um I didn't come uh ; maybe a user
Bmr008_1497	Well , I mean , you could do a you could first determine that something was voiced or not . ; I mean like if one speaker 's voicing and the other one isn't and they 're overlapping , do we know that the first speaker 's voicing , or not ? ; Well , I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time ; Ah .
Buw001_2303	OK . ; Great . ; Great . ; Great .
Bed009_1055	Mm - hmm . ; And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive . ; And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1031	It doesn't sound like the person ; i it sounds normal . ; It 's as if the person could 've stopped there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_658	I I just ; Mm - hmm . ; So , who did you talk to ? ; There was some some guy from SRI who wanted to to install
Bro005_599	Yeah . ; So . ; So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do . ; Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms
Bro027_1029	You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? ; Mm - hmm . ; What 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? ; Oh ,
Btr002_978	do you do this too ? ; I 'm so scared . ; Like I I won't hold shift down ; To to hold shift down while you 're backspacing ?
Bro011_655	Mm - hmm . ; And uh ; And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , ; and that was th um the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state .
Bed006_1089	Yeah . ; OK . ; and um and so ; Yeah I mean I I still am not entirely sure that I really fully grasp the syntax of this .
Bmr021_921	Oh . ; Yeah , and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors . ; Yep . ; And that would blow up the
Bmr011_1719	Yep . ; Yeah , and Dave uh Gel - Gelbart again , ; and Dave . ; Yep .
Bro021_513	TIMIT uh , phone recognition with TIMIT . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; Oh , so then you 'll feed those
Bed011_714	or ? ; Oh ! ; So . ; Mmm g that 's good .
Btr002_1832	Huh . ; Sorry . ; Yeah ? ; sorry , to I just remembered one thing that really was you needed
Btr001_1582	Yeah , ; and when you 're when you 're , um , just checking you 're You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up , ; Mmm . ; and I usually assume that , um , the words are mostly right ,
Bro012_1440	We were doing training on a particular announcer ; Mm - hmm . ; and and getting a very good handle on the features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1795	and maybe you 've posted it before ; but where would I look if I want to see ? ; Oh I You want audio ? ; You know .
Bns003_447	And , um , ; but I think that 's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general , on the highest level . ; OK , ; I have no problem with that .
Bed017_170	because , um , then you have one - user objects ; and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind . ; And so ; for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility .
Btr002_986	I 'll collapse everything ! " ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ! ; I 'm just like , " What am I doing ? " ; I totally do that now .
Bmr026_944	And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . ; So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions . ; Yeah , and I think and we sh again check we should check with Stephane . ; My impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much .
Bro024_736	Yeah . ; So . ; Then if we can improve the noise estimation , then it should get better . ; Yeah ,
Bro026_678	Mm - hmm . ; So is this , uh ? ; Uh , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks . ; That 's it .
Bns003_188	or ; uh ; He 's laughing all the time . ; Why ?
Bed006_1569	Yeah . ; e ; Um how how are your ; That would be good .
Bmr009_383	" Yeah ! " ; Yeah . ; And it doesn't take you don't take the floor . ; Um , but , some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .
Bmr006_650	So should , um One question I had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . ; Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? ; We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . ; That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out .
Bmr006_1144	Mm - hmm . ; I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , ; That 's good . ; but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files .
Bed005_605	this is what we think we should add " , ; OK ? ; and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying " Hmm , well " ; OK ?
Bro004_760	Ye - yeah but here it 's something different . ; We want to have features ; uh well , um . ; Yeah .
Bro014_957	and ; Mm - hmm . ; But in in reality , it 's you know , there 's all of this this overlap and so forth , ; Oh , sorry .
Bmr027_1085	uh , this is a term . ; The problem with terminology . ; Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . ; But really it 's " QS in advance " .
Bmr005_52	You mean that as an event also . ; So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that ; To ; right .
Bro028_501	So I 've , um , downloaded , uh , a couple of things from Mississippi State . ; Um , one is their software ; their , uh , LVCSR system . ; Downloaded the latest version of that .
Bro013_313	Because because we have ano an extra month or something . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_700	So do kiwi . ; Really ? ; Oh . OK , but I was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm . ; But coconut anana pineapple , that 's that 's tricky , yeah .
Bmr021_87	um , and then get duplicates . ; Hmm . ; I mean , there 's no problem with that . ; It 's just what Should we get just more Sony ones ?
Bed015_569	Yeah . ; But , you know , whatever , ; we we 're ; Yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going .
Buw001_1616	Right . ; and clean it up by mid - July . ; PDA - free . ; Yeah .
Bed002_917	You know her ? ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bro004_322	so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . ; Mmm . ; It sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language ; or I mean . You have the same number of parameters in the neural net ,
Bed006_339	Um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data ? ; Based on the web site , ; yeah , at the ; Oh OK
Bro026_142	So , um . ; I mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part . ; So then there 's something central ; and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially .
Bro024_436	Um , and the hope in all of this is that by going multi - band and by going into these , um intermediate classifications , that we can get a system that 's more robust to to unseen noises , and situations like that . ; Um , ; and so , ; some of the research issues involved in this are , um , one , what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify ?
Bro025_158	OK . ; Compared to the last evaluation numbers ? Yeah . ; But , uh ; Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bro017_129	and suddenly you are saying " oh no we we will do something less " , ; but maybe we should discuss that . ; And everybody said " oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there " ; and I said " well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . "
Bro021_47	Where where 's it gonna be this year ? ; It 's , uh , Aalborg in Denmark . ; Oh , OK . ; And it 's ,
Bmr011_1181	uh , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point ; but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? ; And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? ; So , um , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting
Bed013_432	so put that those things over your ears like that . ; OK . ; See the p how the plastic things ar arch out like that ? ; There we go .
Bed017_594	but it just I 'm a little surprised that uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send . ; Alright . ; Uh I don't know , I mean the uh ; I mean I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program .
Bed008_503	So , you know what does this look like , ; what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , ; what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_109	Yeah . No problem . ; I just don't think I think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things . ; Yeah . Well , if we can get it to understand one thing , like our " where is " run through we can also , maybe , e make it say , or ask " where is X ? " Or not . ; Mmm , I don't know .
Bmr007_175	Oh sure . ; And it would be , you know of course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , ; and i and I and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , ; I mean , the general cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking ,
Bro027_627	OK . ; so . ; It should not make ; OK .
Bmr019_827	is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , that would help . ; No . ; And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand ; So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber
Btr002_1905	Oh , thank you . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Cool ! ; It 's really @ @ .
Bro010_194	But , uh , ; you know , it 's ; Yeah , ; and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency .
Bro024_1783	Mm - hmm . ; T we are we may also have to do something similar @ @ . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , our tradition here has always been to focus on the mismatched .
Bmr015_250	Yep . ; But then I got some sort of funny mail saying that the moderator was going to ; It 's ; That 's because they set the one up at UW
Bmr018_1269	that 's good ! ; What did you say ? ; wh ; A little ,
Bro018_159	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a clever thing to do . ; What if you stopped being clever ?
Bro013_196	Yeah . ; Sure , but I mean , ; um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_368	Maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest doesn't matter . ; Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which I I guess they 're starting to look at up there , training to something more like articulatory features . ; Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2015	They take longer to do . ; It takes a long time , yeah . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bro024_1286	we were looking at this . ; But for most of the noises , noises are ; um , ; I don't know if we want to talk about that .
Bro012_264	on the other training set , I mean . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; You said on the other cases you didn't notice
Bmr029_866	So the t two training sets won't be identical . ; Yeah . ; He throws out some speakers that are that are very small . ; Yeah . Have just a little bit .
Bmr005_1076	Yeah . ; that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . ; You know , so so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation ; Yeah , so you Given that um
Bmr007_533	Yeah . ; Thank you . ; E for example . ; you know , like you you get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing
Bro025_43	Um , the second sheet is abo uh , about the same . ; It 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter , ; and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . ; Mmm .
Bro023_1604	But ; OK . ; But the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires a a noise estimate . ; Yeah .
Bro025_103	and you 're gonna end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . ; And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth ,
Bed003_1465	It was a while ago . ; The Transcontinental Railroad , ; doesn't that ring a bell ? ; I think it has to exist somewhere .
Bro007_152	So ; Alright so for now at least that 's not there ; you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum ; doesn't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .
Bro003_1727	I mean , maybe that 's the right thing ; the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do . ; Um , I I think that ; Let 's fall back to that .
Bmr012_1208	OK I 'll I 'll ask . ; You 'll have to check with them , ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bed010_477	Yeah . ; Yeah make yourself a note . ; So and and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , ; so whatever you guys can get .
Bmr027_1102	not the internet unknown " . ; And it it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , ; not the internet backbone core " . ; Now this is a lot of terminology .
Bro010_239	so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . ; So . ; And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . ; No .
Bed012_590	Mm - hmm . ; It 's somewha It 's boggling me . ; OK . ; Alright .
Bro022_490	and , ; um , ; there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . ; So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that ,
Bmr016_147	and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have . ; Right . ; Well that 's fine with me as long as It 's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1254	Where else would it be stored ? ; That 's the question . ; Well , in the beginning , we 'll write up a flat file . ; We know we have twenty object types
Btr002_1425	Cuz , yeah , if the s the resolution If it 's moving too slowly then , like , if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused . ; or I s ; But if it 's moving quickly , seems that it 's covering more ground faster , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_584	Uh if you can fit it in . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh I have yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too ; uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands
Buw001_701	So so to address what what Adam 's saying , ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I think you uh , that
Bmr018_1046	and it 's possible that you get considerably better results if you , uh , manage to adapt the , uh , phone models to the speaker and the reject model to the to to all the other speech . ; Um , so ; Could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ? ; That 's what he just said .
Bro028_1069	and if if your order had been different in throwing them out . ; I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , ; but it seems like a pretty good heuristic . ; Hmm .
Bed004_83	The uh ; Should I go first , with the uh , um , data . ; Can I have the remote control . ; Thank you .
Bmr031_1392	Right . Anyway , uh , so I I I couldn't judge whether this was original or not , ; but but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data . ; So we might want to look into that . ; Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper .
Bmr016_1064	Because it 's not backed up . ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's just ; So we just
Bmr023_146	Right ? ; Right . ; Yeah . Actually it looks like it 's getting better . ; Oh .
Bed006_670	we have a whole library of schemas . ; And they 're gonna be , you know , fleshed out in in their real ugly detail , ; Source - Path - Goal , ; and there 's gonna be s a lot of stuff on the Goal and blah - blah - blah , that a goal can be and so forth .
Bed010_480	so whatever you guys can get . ; The German . ; Oh yeah , of course , German . ; Yeah .
Bro005_428	Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net ; Yeah . ; and straight features with delta - delta . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1014	hmm ; OK . ; Maybe not , ; But that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from
Bmr007_684	Or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove , uh visual contact . ; Yeah . ; Barriers ! ; Yeah .
Bro017_99	And uh we will run again ; still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , ; but I assume so . ; Because uh we would fight for that , really .
Bed015_1345	I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . ; So They 're more lexically marked , right ? ; At least in English . ; Mmm .
Bmr010_231	but but Yeah , it 's a ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_1051	I don't know . ; so that means we have to read the transcript script number and then the numbers , ; and if there 's a new line , a short break . ; And , afterwards we have to ,
Bmr026_795	But a percent and a half ? ; That 's ; Yeah , it 's pretty impressive . ; And And so uh after I told the my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a
Btr002_2872	And ch what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been , ; they were just very small , ; but they were there . ; I think they 're there pretty much a all the time .
Bmr005_581	Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your if i if if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people people 's speech , you will you will get that somewhat better . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Um , Are you making any use
Bmr028_67	Right . ; And so the other thing I sh she wanted to display the stylized F zeroes , I think they 're called ? ; Is that right ? ; Yeah . The linear fit .
Bro013_245	Yeah , I guess . ; Right ? ; I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_410	So action he action here means dia uh speech ac uh you know dialogue act . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , in that in that sense
Buw001_1911	you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers ; or ; I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages . ; That 's what we could do .
Bmr001_476	So if we 're if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ? ; Yeah . ; Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use we 'd only use the distant mikes , ; OK .
Btr002_440	It 's possible . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Well , you know , there 's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation ,
Bed011_1031	there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like " Get " plus path expression for , you know , " how d ho how do I get there ? " , ; Mm - hmm . ; " How do I get in ? " , ; " How do I get away ? "
Bed013_1136	So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question . ; So what what would the outcome of of your parser look like ? ; And , what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get , squeeze out of that utterance ? ; So define the the input into the Bayes - net based on what the utterance , " where is X " , gives us .
Bed008_1138	I mean it can get big fast . ; Um for endpoint ? ; No it 's it 's sh ; EV - it 's the EVA .
Bmr019_1633	I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , it would be useful for the to see what we get with that one . ; Great .
Bmr010_462	Right . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same . ; and collections at NIST .
Bro003_2011	to see if it if you get a big win . ; Do you know what I 'm saying ? ; No . ; So ,
Bro022_334	I mean . ; Uh , no . ; I mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , ; Nuh - huh .
Bmr025_1022	OK . ; I mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs ; uh um recognition runs , ; trying to figure things out about the features
Buw001_1308	We 'll I mean , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , ; so try to pick things that other people didn't say . ; It 's gonna take some thought . ; I mean ,
Bed005_325	But ; OK . Um , let 's hope that the generation will not be more difficult , ; even though the generator is a little bit more complex . ; Uh but we 'll
Bro023_556	Oh , so they will send files ; so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed016_703	Right right r ; w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something ; and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions ; and then it 's construed as something ,
Bro016_424	And that you figure on actually finishing it in in June . ; Because , you know , you 're gonna have another bunch of results to fit in there anyway . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_475	OK . ; Sorry ? ; Somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground ? ; Yes .
Bmr016_1996	So that 's the ; and you get rid of anything that was read . ; yeah . ; So there wouldn't be something like
Bed014_753	So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines , ; and the local rules are if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done . ; Oh , s ; OK . So if , you know if this is seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done .
Bro021_534	segment . ; You know , ; so something that is transitional in nature . ; Right .
Bmr016_553	I think , to ; OK . ; I mean if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . ; OK , thank you .
Bmr016_1798	Um , ; y yeah . ; Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . ; It 's just disturbing .
Bro004_1188	but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . ; Mmm . ; And the LDA introduces delays , ; and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path
Btr002_1831	And ; Huh . ; Sorry . ; Yeah ?
Bmr006_916	What 's it written in ? ; Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , ; because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . ; Ah .
Bmr008_400	I think I think you can put " optional " ; I mean I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think would just lie about it . ; it 's not gonna ; Right .
Bmr003_1409	Yeah . ; Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog ; Mm - hmm . ; So I mean , tho those are things we could do
Bro005_1172	So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that ; um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , ; which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_931	We had something more fancy . ; It was later on ; it didn't have that . ; So at that point I reali " oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter "
Bsr001_2577	Hmm , hmm . ; So . ; Although unfortunately , you know , they 're all pretty close , ; Hmm .
Bed003_1811	or see it or something . ; So that we can label it . ; I mean , that 's how we get a corpus that we can label . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_831	and so again re that 's completely correct , ; we have the user model , the situation model here , ; we don't have the discourse model here yet . ; Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here .
Bmr011_637	I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , ; Just ; but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . ; So you would have a t completely separate set up ,
Bmr012_1047	and Sony only sells this headset . ; Mmm . ; So if we wanna use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end ; and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself .
Btr002_404	Uh , " groups of " , ; " gruesome " . ; g Group . ; OK .
Btr002_3436	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK . So , who wants to start ? ; Well , I guess I 'll start .
Bro027_327	Which is ; I mean , the Aurora . ; Aurora has a clean subset . ; I mean , they want to train it
Bro027_129	because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room . ; Mm - hmm . ; Would that be more like ; Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car ,
Bro024_1072	They actually changed the compression scheme altogether . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they have their own compression and decoding scheme ; and they I don't know what they have .
Bmr027_1112	Yeah , but I bet I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though . ; Mmm . ; No , actually no . ; Oh , really ?
Bro014_721	But how much worse since the weighting might change ; how how much worse is it on the other conditions , ; when you say it 's a little worse ? ; It 's like , uh , fff , fff um , ten percent relative .
Bmr008_395	They might lie anyway . ; Yeah . ; But if you put " Optional " , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ? ; I don't know .
Bed010_903	Exactly . ; It 's So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , right .
Bed003_928	This ; but . ; Nope . ; Didn't do it .
Bed003_1437	and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says New York ; and you say Track seven , ; huh ? ; And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than " New York " ,
Bed015_215	Th - so this definitely should be " semantic constraints " down at the bottom ? ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed002_234	If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , ; and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . ; If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , you have to go this way , and go up here . ; And there you have a vre really view It exploded , the during the Thirty
Bns002_1054	Yeah . ; Hmm ? ; Uh well , the main the main problems that some of the solutions eh are exhibiting , is uh the lack of eh scalability ; uh mainly the source routing protocols have a problem when you when you scale from or scale scale badly from tens of nodes to to thousands of nodes
Bro003_817	Albayzin is the name . ; What about TI - digits ? ; Um , TI - digits ; uh all these Aurora f d data p data is from is derived from TI - digits .
Bed002_1260	OK . ; OK . ; S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . ; If if you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they
Bmr027_1146	And then I also the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones ; C ; because of the problem of low gain in the originals . ; And and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones ,
Bsr001_1409	Yeah , which i ; And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . ; Well , just just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem . ; Yep .
Btr002_262	Yeah , the first one is like , the " so " is connected to the sentence , ; Bu And ; and " That 'd be a problem , so . " ; yeah .
Bns001_1726	Yeah . ; and then get rid of SDH . ; There 's the problem is is , you see that the providers eh have always there broken view for for the management . ; If you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system , and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff , in principle , but you still need it , is eh not aligned .
Bed006_718	Basically , what this is is that there 's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner ; Spit right here . ; and right now the way the interface is " action go " and then they have the what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1387	Well , ; Yeah . ; there 's another there 's another word error . ; Except for now !
Bro012_1022	So it 's it 's almost like everything 's held up waiting for this one thing . ; I don't know if that 's true or not , ; but I could see how ; Mmm .
Bed017_764	but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , ; Yeah . ; and also revising , ; thanks for all the comments ,
Bro018_417	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; He 's I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_744	Mm - hmm . ; it probably too , you can find , eh , that the instantaneous frequency for the continuous , eh , eh the output of the continuous filters are very near . ; And in my case i in equal with our signal , it doesn't happened . ; Yeah . I 'd hafta look at that and think about it .
Btr002_627	I mean it does seem like when I hear these things , except for the distortion parts , ; where the volume 's too high , or th of course when the volume 's too low , ; but that 's a different problem , ; um , except for those cases , it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear .
Buw001_1191	OK . ; h Thanks , bye . ; That 's not a lot of time , ; That 's that .
Bmr015_865	you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , ; um , ; in in , uh , ; what domain ?
Bed014_1293	which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; OK .
Bed006_1739	Like every time I say it , it 's horrible . ; OK . ; I see what you mean . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1007	Sorry . ; E - EVA ; Uh ; Yeah ,
Bro017_554	Uh , but not ; Which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is ; Yeah . ; Yes . Yes .
Bro022_738	That 's true , ; but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things ; because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_662	Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , ; Right . ; and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . ; OK .
Bed005_921	which is instructions for the generator . ; Right . ; OK ? ; And then there 's a language generator ,
Bro016_777	so I don ; Well . ; I don't know . ; That means they 're between zero and one .
Bro024_1709	you have somehow a noise estimate , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , if you say I 'm I 'm with my envelope ; I 'm close to this noise estimate ,
Bmr003_2008	I agree . ; Yeah , it is true , that is it benefits to ; Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later . ; That 's right .
Bmr002_1089	I also wanted to say , in terms of like disc you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours I do have a certain amount of background in that ; and I really would be I 'd like to be involved in that . ; Right . ; No , right , I didn't mean to imply that that we that that we shouldn't discuss this now ,
Btr001_679	Oh , wow . ; Right . ; That took a l ; Which wasn't as hard .
Bmr003_1544	I know . ; Well , you 'll see . ; Well what what it what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total totally impolite . ; You can listen to it .
Bmr012_691	it 's just the audio data itself , ; de audio data itself ? ; until people have a chance to edit it . ; Mm - hmm , exactly .
Bed003_1664	OK . ; But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore . ; Is that the deal ? ; Yep .
Bns002_43	and eh , ; eh ; well , the research topics at this moment is uh , I P - eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and em eh tool developing tools uh for quality of service , eh performance analysis . ; That 's eh And we have several projects eh both Spanish and European projects , ongoing
Bed010_233	Just give a talk in the big room , and and so peo people know what 's going on ? ; when you 're ready ? ; Absolutely . ; Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing
Bdb001_533	Yep . ; as easy it could as it could be . ; But , ; I suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies " utt " ,
Bro011_480	So he doesn't have ; Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that ; which means that it 's it 's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . ; You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure .
Bro027_105	Right ? ; From zero to four K . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz .
Bro003_828	Yeah , ; we cou we could use ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro017_454	Speaker recognition ? ; No , for uh Aurora ? ; Uh there , we don't know about evaluation , ; next meeting is in June .
Bns001_780	and then then figure out that it works ? ; So , that 's my point . ; Well , just to make the list a little bit longer . ; Yep .
Bed003_1114	Does he ; I I saw directory called " source " , ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_151	OK . ; So ; Alright so for now at least that 's not there ; you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum
Bmr006_1314	Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It seems like that would be pretty strong .
Bed012_202	Mm - hmm . ; as for th to decide the response . ; And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes . ; OK .
Bmr008_1711	Eh , what ; Good . ; sorry . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_545	Yeah . ; Yep . ; I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation ; Right .
Bro027_1334	Mm - hmm . ; If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , uh , improving the the net . ; Yeah , ; mm - hmm .
Btr001_173	Oh , yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah , good c ; Oh , it doesn't look so bad ,
Bsr001_1174	Yeah . ; What I can do is say , la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la . ; But that 's only on one sp ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1037	Yeah . ; But I don't think it 's " aha ! " . ; Yeah . ; It 's more like " uh - huh ! "
Bed015_536	So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be ; like the question is for example , what does " Watergate " refer to there ? ; Does it , you know does it refer to , um ; if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say " Watergate " you 're referring to " a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France " .
Bmr027_609	that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . ; Yeah . ; Then they just come back . ; All my files were still here .
Bmr028_1487	In the multi - band experiments , in the first one , we really wanted to find out , " what if you knew which band was really noisy ? " ; Uh - huh ! ; N Right . ; I mean , suppose you just know that .
Bro023_591	So by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances , ; Mmm . ; which could be due to the word pattern . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_33	which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms , ; have filled out speaker forms . ; Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . ; So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms
Bro021_1076	It 's just by definition that the individual that the , uh ; So , capital X is by definition the same as E to the little X ; because she 's saying that the little X is is the , uh is the log . ; Alright .
Bmr005_1162	OK . ; Um , back on the data thing , ; so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have . ; We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed ,
Bmr027_1143	Yeah . ; and I don't want them to do that . ; Yeah . ; And then I also the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones
Btr001_2535	which he does . ; Have you run across these mock fights ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And he s he says , um , something like ,
Btr002_2807	I was told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh , and also I I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying . ; Hmm !
Buw001_1741	And then p possibly ; I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . ; I should have sent I should have CC ' ed you as well . ; OK .
Bmr028_274	Great . ; And we should be there pretty soon , ; with at least , like at least with , you know , being able to search over c certain amount of meetings , ; just , like , really basic stuff .
Bmr020_412	Were you including the the lapel in this ? ; Yes . ; And did the did did the la did the the problems with the lapel go away also ? ; Um , it Yeah .
Bmr028_17	I think that 's correct . ; and ? ; Yeah . I think so , too . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1553	Oh ! ; And then I I have I used this as mean speech energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , it 's just a constant amount over all .
Bmr003_424	In doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data ; Great idea . ; because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far . ; That 's true .
Bed002_1220	I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , " Here 's the package , ; here 's the current one we have , " ; uh , you know , " What other ideas do you have ? " ; and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file .
Bns001_604	Uh do ; Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah !
Bed012_214	Why not the whol ; Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question . ; So we 'd have a node for the Where - Is question . ; Yeah . But we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the Where - Is ,
Bro028_508	Um , so I haven't run the scripts yet . ; Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it ; and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it . ; So I 'm waiting to hear from him .
Bmr010_393	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a good point . ; Hmm .
Bmr029_222	and we were gonna use one of the P Z ; I don I don't know what ; Probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits . ; I think it 's that one .
Bmr016_2289	I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern . ; You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1811	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Why is it that I can read your mind ?
Bro014_322	Yeah . ; So it 's , ; uh , ; Hmm .
Bro005_739	right ? ; It 's There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be
Bed005_1216	Yeah . ; So Eh Um ; Well , my point was more that we just eh ; With the neural net , right , eh , things come in , you have a function that combines them
Bmr007_338	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; That 's really neat .
Bmr007_1260	OK . ; They 're easy to find , then . ; Alright , so , uh I think we should , uh uh , go on to the digits ? ; OK .
Bro024_1503	Right . ; Mmm , ; Yeah , that will reduce the variance . ; That 'll help .
Bro017_340	but it 's what 's happening in the in the close neighborhood . ; So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz , ; but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz . ; So it 's really w
Bmr005_801	OK , ; and it , uh ; I 'm sorry I missed the ; It 's OK .
Bmr029_681	Well , once I do that , uh , second experiment , we 'll have the , um , files , ; and I can give you those to to process . ; OK . ; And there 's , um ,
Bro005_691	Ugh ! I was impressed ; boy , ; two thousand . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1191	OK . ; Yeah . ; So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1082	Yeah . There could be a bug in in the somewhere before that . ; There we could ; the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the K L T transform ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_657	It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline , ; or ; You know ? ; Well , I think people just had
Bns001_824	And ; So " network applications " , if you look at the name of the group , one thing is that um the they used to call a a n a " network " that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network . ; If you look at " network " from the OZ layer , then it 's uh , level two or something or maybe level three , but everything below three . ; So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh " network " .
Bmr024_180	The only the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits . ; Right . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr010_112	and you 're testing the hypothesis that , uh , there is a change . ; Yeah . ; So ; so anyway , I just reporting that .
Bmr024_427	And how do we find the transcripts for those so that ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; The references for for those segments ?
Bdb001_373	Yeah , I mean , they 'd be emo enormous . ; Right . ; and ; So it 's doable ,
Bmr019_771	Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , ; or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or ? ; We we didn't ; No .
Bmr020_340	and then the second one was just basically the the stuff we had in the in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance . ; Hmm . ; Nope . ; Right .
Bro005_212	yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , um So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . ; Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched
Bmr024_9	Well , so , here 's the thing . ; Um , why don't we s again start off with with , ; uh , ; Yeah , I 'll get it .
Buw001_271	How about this idea ? ; That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . ; Yeah , good . ; Good point .
Bro008_90	Mmm . ; Uh , I mean , first place , there 's still this thing to to work out , ; and second place second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr021_633	Yeah , ; I 'm not sure whether that 's right . ; one one can imagine that that might be problematic . ; Yeah , one can imagine the problems that that would engender .
Bro022_1094	Mm - hmm . ; So , those are the regions where there are , like ; Mm - hmm . ; when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech .
Bro024_1320	So re - estimation of the alignment using the neural network , I guess . ; That 's right ? ; Yeah . ; We actually trained , uh , the on the Italian training part .
Bmr003_917	I mean that 's easy enough . ; I could do that . ; Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? ; That would be the automatic boundaries .
Bmr022_911	they 're probably talking to nobody , ; but ; Oh they they have little headsets ? ; Yep .
Bmr008_1294	Great , OK . ; So . ; Well , that was that one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_216	And in fact there 're some where , um ; ugh ; well , I mean there 's it 's the double thing . ; It 's the equipment and also how it 's worn .
Bmr024_153	Um , but , uh ; I recognize that , too . ; Yeah . ; Ha .
Bns001_262	If you have your own common activity . That makes a little bit more easier . ; And , uh , if there is a technical linkage between such , uh um , between the outer world and us OK , the better it is . ; But , anyway , if we come to a certain kind of uh , common work within the core of the NSA group , I think that 's really beneficial to everybody . ; And uh , especially , Wilbert , if you have in mind to go in the mmm , uh , really from the project proposal view , I think we can build it on this this core .
Bmr020_86	So if there 's anything that n absolutely , desperately needs to be done , you should let me know now . ; Uh , and you just sent off a Eurospeech paper , ; so . ; Right .
Bro016_994	Oh , oh . ; Yeah . ; For tw ; That 's right ,
Bro012_241	Mmm , yeah . ; it 's just very um ; you know get stuck in some local minimum ; and this thing throws you out of it I guess .
Btr002_559	kind of graspy ; raspy , I mean , ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_558	Well , if it 's just the audio ; that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . ; Well . ; That 's what Adam wanted .
Bmr030_7	Fourteen whatever . ; So , topic number one is , we got the NSF ATR ; ITR , ; excuse me ,
Bed014_751	Yeah . ; OK . ; So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines , ; and the local rules are if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done .
Bed017_266	Um , uh these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? ; I can't really see the whole thing . ; or are they have they changed , in a sense ? ; Well I think I basically leave them to similar things .
Bro018_588	So why save the examples ? ; Why not just save what the boundary itself is ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . Hmm .
Bmr028_595	Yeah . ; See what the length distribution is . ; Yeah . But but y there 's there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_446	So , with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking . ; Right ? ; Can we ? ; We we talked about this before .
Bro003_103	Going to Oakland . ; Yeah , Oakland . ; Oakland . ; Yeah .
Bro021_676	and I got , like , worse results than not using it . ; Then I ; So , I 've been trying to find where the problem came from . ; And then it looks like I have some problem in the way
Bmr027_316	OK . ; I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , ; but I had the feeling I should probably respond ; and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date ,
Bmr010_387	Mm - hmm . ; And we discussed on some methods to do it . ; My approach originally , ; and I 've already hacked on it a little bit
Bro005_794	Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . ; That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task ; If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . ; Mmm .
Bed017_638	because he did some work on topic spotting ; Yeah . ; St - statistical stuff . ; That would be a very good idea .
Bmr003_388	I 've been watching for that corpus . ; Um , of general spoken English . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro021_638	uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , ; and and and , since I got thinking about it , ; and and , uh , ; so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think ,
Bro012_592	Sounds like a great idea ; but but I think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . ; Mmm . ; But that 'll be uh , uh done in a week .
Bmr015_414	Yeah . ; I thought it was smaller , ; that it was like four or five , ; wasn't it ?
Bed011_501	yeah . ; So it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things , ; Hmm , mm - hmm . ; and then , what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect .
Bro014_838	Right . ; So ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro008_86	So ; So ; How much how much better was the best system than ours ? ; Well , we don't know yet .
Bro022_753	And ; mm - hmm . ; Uh , yeah . ; OK .
Bro024_489	Why why I was not getting it . ; And I found that , the noise estimation is a reason for the TI - digits to perform worse than the baseline . ; So , uh , I actually , picked th ; I mean , the first thing I did was I just scaled the noise estimate by a factor which is less than one to see if that because I found there are a lot of zeros in the spectrogram for the TI - digits when I used this approach .
Btr002_2710	And you can see it . ; Right . ; You can see the little little peaks , which is interesting . ; Right .
Bro003_1994	OK . ; So that that 'll work , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_979	Well , it 's not precisely . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; I mean ,
Bed003_965	And . ; Yeah . ; I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java ; it 's cra has a GUI and it 's uh
Bmr011_190	but have them all be the same mike . ; I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing ; and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , uh , more uniformity , ; Right .
Bmr030_812	We can increase the size of the disks that are on it , ; but that will only take us so far . ; So , um , ; David had the suggestion about , you know , new servers and things like that ,
Bmr007_738	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Beam - forming during the digit uh stuff . ; So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number .
Bmr011_199	Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n uh , ; Well ; so yeah , uniformity would be great . ; Yeah .
Bed014_190	Yeah , I know . ; That doesn't sound , exactly right either . ; OGI has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice ; and we 're going to use that .
Bed002_1278	Because it can produce better answers , ; tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , ; n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point ; or a red line that goes to the Tango point
Bro027_402	Uh , he he , uh he was here for a couple years ; and he , uh got his PHD . ; Oh , OK . ; He
Bro026_829	I ; I mean , it 's to you . ; Maybe , yeah . ; I ju you guys are
Bmr025_633	They take up a lot more room anyway . ; Yeah . ; Uh but we do need more disk . ; So we can get more disk .
Bdb001_565	Right . ; and ; It seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1369	Only one of those things are gonna be lit up when we pass this on . ; OK . ; So only Enter will be ; if we if our if our module decided that Enter is the case , View and Approach will not be there .
Btr002_1015	So . ; Hmm . ; Oh . ; How do you get per I don't know the evil apostrophe .
Bro018_255	Still , ; Uh . ; Well actually , so this is a test that you should do then . ; Um , if you 're getting fifty - six percent over here ,
Bro027_349	but I think I think that , um um , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to ; OK . ; Uh @ @ you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_780	But it 's just , you know , the the body ; He agreed . ; you know ? ; Of course , the where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to cong to gravitate to the same place each time .
Bro024_1115	This one is you don't need it , ; alright . ; Uh ; So you have to take the whole the five .
Bmr005_1421	What if we give people you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? ; Well , you know , I I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . ; OK . ; Alright , alright , alright .
Btr002_2885	Hmm ! ; No , not at all . ; Exactly . Exactly . ; Yeah !
Bro017_843	Right ? ; Saying . ; but ; uh , no , no I don't think that it would be the same .
Bro027_1592	i d I 'm sorry , ; does it still have the median filter stuff ? ; It still has the median filter . ; So it still has most of the delay ,
Bed017_704	In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , ; even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left , ; so , uh , they think the money 's coming . ; So and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters .
Bro027_1651	Yeah . ; So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro004_372	Yeah . ; But but i it sounds like ; Um , but He Mm - hmm . ; I mean . That 's interesting
Bmr011_455	I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work . ; Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room ; but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . ; They don't have the t the transcription standards .
Buw001_2010	So . ; So it also depends on the style of the group of people . ; Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting . ; Right .
Bed010_845	And how much we build , and and so forth . ; I ; Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh ; It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling .
Bmr012_403	and Switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic ; Excellent . ; and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one ; so there was @ @ so that 's great .
Bmr028_1710	and ; Right . Exactly . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; And actually , an an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and and m you know , maybe just
Bmr002_812	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , that 's sort of my feeling about it , ; that you should be you should be able to translate between an XML and non - XML version ; cuz most at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly .
Bmr015_216	and yeah sometimes people ; If you say s " three nine eight one " sometimes people will say " thirty - nine eighty - one " ; or " three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one " , ; Yeah .
Bro024_787	maybe you 'll f for this time . ; So usually you have maybe in clean condition you have something which looks like this . ; And if it is noisy it is somewhere here . ; And then you try to subtract it or Wiener filter or whatever .
Bmr005_688	Well , I but I have a suggestion about that . ; Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things ; which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting , ; but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s
Bed013_817	a few more bits . ; Well , there was like we needed to or uh , in my opinion we need to design a Bayes another sub - Bayes - net ; You know , it was whether it was whether we would have a Bayes - net on the output and on the input , ; Oh .
Bro027_1503	So . ; Yeah . ; No , well , that 's a good idea . ; I I
Bns002_33	It 's only a microphone . ; that 's ; Ah , ; Yeah ?
Bmr010_524	Yeah . ; If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and and play around with it , ; and and get a feeling for it . ; I mean , the the the ,
Btr001_805	I guess I 'm the only non - linguist . ; Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid , ; so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1175	I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . ; In other words , it 's uh ; I mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro003_831	OK . ; The French data . ; Spanish stories ? ; No .
Bed004_350	but uh whether the where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether ; Mm - hmm . ; or the " landmark - iness " of where I 'm currently at . ; And " usefulness " is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever .
Bmr015_1163	But ; u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . ; Mm - hmm . ; See , in a in a way this is a really key point ,
Bmr009_106	Yeah , eith eith uh B ; Something like that where it 's sort of data driven . ; Yeah , but I think also u I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is , when the two speaker ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr008_1095	So , speaker A is his professor and they and he 's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that . ; Or it could be you know , " so - and - so and so - and - so are married " . ; Hmm . ; Just to pick up an arbitrary an example .
Bmr006_796	No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying " Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? " ; Eh ; Ah ! ; Which category do you put that in ?
Bmr005_111	and see , is there anything to this at all ? ; Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . ; Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his " ; Wrong ,
Btr002_567	Is better . ; Ah , it 's a wider band then . ; Because of ; do you think it might be from the
Bmr027_118	I just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine . ; Right . I mean , that 's fine . ; OK , good . ; I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .
Bed010_958	OK . ; and she 'll be a student as of then . ; And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , ; so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .
Bed010_133	I I think he talked about the idea of like , um He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you , um ; OK , you know how to do it ? ; For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . ; And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional .
Bed004_470	I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , ; so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things . ; Mmm . ; and , um , I understand where this the uh
Bsr001_730	Oh . ; I see . ; You really are challenged to do that , ; Yep .
Bed004_360	Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed ; and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination . ; Um , and then if you go up , ; Robert ,
Bmr011_473	They were interested in ours . ; They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on . ; Alright . ; And one one notable difference u u
Bro003_774	Yeah . ; And Spanish and French is something that we can use in addition to Aurora . ; Uh , well . ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_1337	and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away . ; Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal .
Bro014_547	and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design , ; Yeah . ; so ; Yeah .
Bro017_802	Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data ? ; That would be very bad , ; because uh your t your model was trained uh expecting uh , ; that wouldn't work .
Bmr010_290	Yep . ; Yeah , but then I 'm not sure that 's the right thing for us . ; But ; Yeah .
Bed005_303	Because it gives a you a score . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; And the value of the score is , v I assume , I guess , the more of these optional things that are actually in there , the higher the r score it is .
Bns003_493	So , that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be , um , shown or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Of course that is a living thing . ; I think it 's a good idea ,
Bmr008_191	I 'm just That 's why I was wondering about if you can put something about the d ; Right . ; Can you repeat the categories you had ? ; Yeah .
Bro022_1006	go ahead . ; Maybe you can ; I think it 's ; That 's it for me .
Bro024_1641	Yeah . ; Um ; And did did you try simply to smooth um to smooth the the t to to smooth stronger the the envelope ? ; Um ,
Bsr001_1988	Um . ; Well , so we haven't even you know , we haven't collected a byte yet ; Right . ; That 's actually why I called this meeting ,
Bmr025_1058	or ; I don't know about other people . ; or you start laughing . ; OK , alright .
Bmr006_888	It 's just sort of that the the background acoustic ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1593	So uh I believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh between the um um involved nodes , ; and making it necessary , in principle , to deal with our four building blocks in um yeah , I believe , in a difficult way , ; if , uh , we have in mind quality of service routing , and and uh qualit uh mobility aspects and and all this kinds of things for I P layer functionality . ; So that 's , in principle , uh an overview , of the protocol stack
Bro018_1004	since it was an advantage . ; Mm - hmm . ; um uh ; but we did eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal .
Bmr024_540	well , here 's some more data . ; Should this be part of the corpus or not ? ; And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics , as opposed to just for language . ; Um , or also for dialogue of various sorts .
Btr002_1247	which is what you figure . ; And , um , did you I thought you might have done that , Joel . ; Did you also ? ; Nn - nnn . No .
Bro018_213	Percent . ; The accuracy . ; Fif - fifty - six percent accurate for v voice - unvoice ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_479	So , um , I mean , I 'll just tell you the party line on that . ; The reason I didn't go for that here was because , uh , the focus , uh , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was uh , in impromptu situations . ; And ; we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations
Bro016_269	Mm - hmm . ; for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit . ; But , ; once we knew what rou roughly the right operating range was , it was pretty stable ,
Bro019_1525	Is that the aligned s ; It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort . ; Oh , no . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_483	And so anyway , the clean those are those things ; and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format . ; And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . ; But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized ,
Bro005_448	Yeah ; so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy . ; uh ; Yeah .
Bro003_1206	I don't know how w how we would P - make this , though . ; Um . ; Well , you have a ; I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the uh , a all these combinations ,
Bmr008_441	As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form . ; Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional , ; That 's that 's the only optional thing , ; Let 's see .
Btr002_79	or ; but they 're not usually that bad , I I don't think . ; Mm - mmm . ; Then , um , I have a couple of others .
Bns002_1177	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , eh , the other mode of operation which should be appropriate , for example , for this meeting room example , uh doesn't require any any access point , ; and in this second case , communication happens f eh um from one computer to the other at the link ly layer .
Buw001_610	Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about . ; I don't know how , ; but for instance , I mean , the outline is sort of up here ; and that 's what people are seeing .
Bro004_828	if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context . ; Well it 's ; But the ; it 's it 's an interesting thought .
Bmr027_1344	but this is what , uh , DARPA had asked for . ; Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . ; But of course the fiscal year starts in October , ; so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .
Bed014_1342	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . ; Right .
Bro004_1001	Yeah . ; Um Yeah , ; Mmm . ; so I think Hynek will be here Monday .
Btr002_1403	But sometimes it moves two frames or two screens , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Oh yes .
Bro004_1036	Um And , he didn't think they had , ; um . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net ; and maybe sometimes you don't run the other , ; maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway .
Bro028_1185	which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ? ; And whereas in in this case you 're saying " let 's just do it unconstrained " . ; So they 're they 're really pretty related ; and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll see the the connections a little better
Bmr006_60	So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , ; um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time ; One offs ? ; Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses ,
Bro005_1108	OK . ; Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean . ; Oh , yeah . ; OK .
Bed012_390	So , but but if we have a finite ; What ? ; I don't see your point . ; What what what I am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities .
Bed008_78	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; And so that a decision would be do we want that ; so you could two different things you could do ,
Bmr029_118	or ? ; Well , that 's only male . ; Or or or was that only male ? ; Uh . Actually , I don't know .
Bmr018_993	And maybe we can for the non - lapel , but ; is it worth ; if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time . ; Well , I 'm thinking
Bmr006_462	Then you 're gonna go home with it . ; It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , ; Yep . ; but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless ,
Bmr031_69	I got it ; since ; Yeah . So I I @ @ Adam sent around this thing about what we were going to talk about ; and and th we had had this discussion of , uh , flipping back and forth between an emphasis on on the technology , particularly recognition , versus , uh , the recordings and transcriptions and so on .
Bro019_1640	I mean , that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , ; as as what you ; Mm - hmm . ; But but yeah ,
Bmr023_43	So I I had a question for Adam . ; Have we started already ? ; Well , we started recording , but Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro016_151	Part of it might just be that the SRI system , they they they always adjust these things to be sort of optimized , ; Is there ? ; and ; I wonder if there 's anything that we could do to the front - end that would affect the insertion
Bmr015_128	Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? ; Yeah . ; Four thousand . ; Four thous Ah ! Four thousand .
Bro012_872	Mm - hmm . ; if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; or the variation in it was larger , uh than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias .
Bns002_516	Let me let me let me show you one thing . ; If this node was transmitting before , it should uh it should ha uh transmit an RTS packet in advance , OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1049	you know . ; Right . ; But but uh i some people are planning ; and , you know , I mean , a lot we always are planning what we 're going to say next .
Bns002_407	Mm - hmm . ; a CTS . ; That 's OK . ; So . In the meantime , when he gets this one , he also had to send RTS and then CTS
Bro013_60	Yeah . ; Oh . ; OK . ; Still .
Bsr001_2376	I hadn't thought about that . ; because otherwise people will ; Mmm . ; Oh right .
Bmr014_1140	and but I I think it 's nice that a person could check . ; Cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_848	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a little bit of stuff to do . ; Right .
Bed013_65	Imagine if you will , that we have a system that does all that understanding that we want it to do based on utterances . ; Mm - hmm . ; It should be possible to make that system produce questions . ; So if you have the knowledge of how to interpret " where is X ? " under given conditions , situational , user , discourse and ontological conditions , you should also be able to make that same system ask " where is X ? "
Bmr009_946	Actually , the only way I know is from working with the database and having to figure it out . ; What ; With TIMIT , ; uh - huh .
Bed003_517	Because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . ; Mm - hmm . ; Take a conti ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_182	so you will have to leave what you set . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And uh , just give me a call ,
Bmr028_1503	And I i i i ; No question about it . ; It 's just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be ; However , you know , if i I understand your point . That it th it has a long tradition in this field
Bed010_146	OK ? ; to uh ; Make our stuff fit to that . ; Yeah , to
Btr002_1291	and you have lots of different voices , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's very clear .
Bmr020_1225	OK . ; Thanks . ; We start with the presegmented version ; Let me mark you as no digits .
Bed002_813	And then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , ; but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? ; now with a human operator . ; And so , you have basically the same tasks again ,
Bro027_444	Mm - hmm . ; S so , I 'm I 'm sorry , ; there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ? ; So it 's twelve times nine .
Bro018_183	Um . ; I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net ; because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this ; you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication .
Bmr026_220	It 's some whatever wrapped thing ; Mmm . ; and you can't you can't access that ; so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack
Bmr020_1506	which ; i Can I maybe have have an order of ; it 's probably in your paper that I haven't looked at lately , ; but
Bro027_1359	Is it like ; Yeah , so it 's four . ; and and , uh , in fact since the others are somewhat better ; Is i
Bns002_46	That 's eh And we have several projects eh both Spanish and European projects , ongoing ; eh in this area . ; OK . ; Thank you .
Bed009_937	so it yeah , s s I thought I 'd ; Mm - hmm . ; So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the in the pattern matcher or not ? ; um Not yet but it 's planned to do that .
Buw001_1871	although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . ; Yeah , OK . ; I 'll do that . ; OK .
Bro014_1263	That 's why I was going to the why I was referring to it in a more a more , uh , uh , conservative way , ; when I was saying " well , it 's ; yeah , ; it 's the excitation " .
Bed011_994	in terms of uh ; Right , but we 're not expecting Keith to actually build a parser . ; No , no , no , no , no . ; Right , Right .
Bmr003_2351	Sure . ; Well of course we do . ; And how do we want to do that ? ; You mean like see see meter readings , from while sitting here .
Bro014_483	and then average that with a weighting ? ; Yeah . ; And so then the that that makes the highly - matched the really big thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_778	Oh . I tried it with and without . ; Uh . ; So without and with adaptation . ; How many iterations ?
Bed009_1107	And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved ; Yeah
Bns003_873	But y ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something .
Bro022_550	The vocal tr ; but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero ; components , ; Yeah .
Bed012_795	Well , it depends on the situation . ; If the discourse is strongly indicating that ; Yeah , but , uh , we have no discourse input . ; Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh
Bmr011_1146	I mean , the the more data we have to try the the alignments on , um , the better . ; So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , ; just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of uh , parameters f on the recognizer , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_738	Oh , yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; right ? ; the input into the action planning , as it is now .
Bns002_962	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range . ; Yeah . ; That 's OK .
Bdb001_794	Right . ; Be ; Because here you 're specifying a lattice . ; Uh
Bro005_1084	and with VAD uh , binary labels ; so that we can uh , get our MLP features ; and filter them with the VAD ; and then combine them with their f feature stream .
Bro017_223	Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave start leaving out the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy ; and then perhaps uh one could try to find a a all - pole model to such a spectrum . ; Because a all - pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . ; That 's what we want to try .
Bns001_625	They have a specific antenna for uh GSM Oh , GPS and and fu for future extended G - uh GSM networks and wireless LAN and and other thi and other network technology . ; In the roof of the car . They have a s lot of servers ; in the trunk of the car . Then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things ; and they are driving around the different areas .
Bmr001_726	But I think that 's alright . ; Yeah , it 's great . ; Yeah . ; Um , we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones
Bmr006_781	So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1376	More digits , the better . ; For th for the for the benefit of science we 'll read the digits . ; OK , ; Thanks thanks a lot .
Bed009_310	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig ; um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a a belief - net which is
Bed006_1751	It just happened to be the acronym . ; Yeah . That 's doesn't make it a great term . ; It 's just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels . ; ye no but i
Bro005_643	seven bands with nine frames of context , ; and we just train on TIMIT , ; and on the large database , ; so , with SPINE and everything .
Bmr016_1041	It was also true of the digits task which was X Waves . ; Because because i we used X Waves to do the digits . ; Yeah . ; And they were loading the full mixed files then ,
Bro022_884	Yeah . ; it plus energy plus timing information is sort of ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then .
Bro015_93	the uh Uh voiced - unvoiced ; uh ; Oh yes . ; But , no .
Bed014_1323	I mean , it 's gonna be plenty hard for for people to understand it as it is , ; but y y you don't want to make it worse . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_139	How - how ; I mean you 've got all these phone labels , ; and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , um , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output , ; or s sort of what 's the , um , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change ?
Bro003_857	Oh , no , no . ; No no no no . ; It 's it 's Spanish from Spain , Spanish . ; Spanish from Spain .
Bmr003_2440	Yeah , ; I think what ; I think you I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , ; so you could probably make it run with that ,
Bro027_408	So . ; Wow . ; Uh , so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets , ; That would be neat .
Buw001_1792	we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing ; and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , ; depending on how you define it , uh , users . ; Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible
Bmr019_1283	Mm - hmm . ; So , I guess , we 'll try to write this Eurospeech paper . ; Superb . ; I mean , we will write it .
Bro011_580	They 've got those initial and final null states . ; And so um their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , ; the four and five which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1157	No . ; Well ; Well , whatever . ; Uh Yeah , so one surprising thing that we can notice first is that apparently the speech miss rate is uh , higher than the false alarm rate .
Bns002_597	Uh , so they transmit the same power , ; and they uh have the same uh uh sensitivity . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they can hear
Bmr016_1514	It 's really it 's really fun to listen to . ; Morgan can make a song out of it . ; All these different vocal tracts , you know , ; but it 's it 's the same item .
Bmr016_282	I haven't ever listened to TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; So I don't really know how it compares . ; Yeah .
Bro005_940	It 's ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's sort of , yes it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose .
Bro026_977	correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , ; but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further .
Bmr029_70	That that 's also ; No . He has to create that . ; But but s but so ; Right .
Bmr019_332	It was that 's that was isolated digits . ; Bell Digits . ; Alright . ; By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .
Bro027_653	Uh , we don't , ; but it 's just ; I mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . ; Uh - huh .
Bro028_1093	Hmm . ; So . ; As as we were talking about this I was thinking , um , whether there 's a relationship between um , between Michael 's approach to , uh , some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets . ; Yeah .
Bed013_228	That 's just That 's uh It 's a billion , right ? ; Two to the thirty ? ; Well , two to the thirty is a billion , ; but if we have to do it two to the twenty times , then that 's a very very large number .
Bro019_1176	I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature ; and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence ; Unvoiced . ; Well .
Buw001_1261	and that and that Dan worked on on that . ; So I thought that was really ; you know . ; So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings
Bro028_628	because I d didn't read also the most recent mails about the large - vocabulary task . ; But , uh , did you do you still , uh , get the mails ? ; You 're not on the mailing list or what ? ; Hmm - mm .
Bed006_1049	so uh ; um ; Well , for me it seems that uh ; I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once ,
Bmr011_879	And that , um , uh , what they 're doing is giving them ; Hmm . ; Like medical transcriptionist type people ; Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products ,
Bro003_1659	Uh . ; So that this could be another dimension , ; but we think perhaps we can use the the best , uh , um , uh , normalization scheme as OGI is using , ; so , with parameters that they use there ,
Bmr023_595	Yeah . ; I I I think ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr026_111	And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead . ; You are going to ; I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits . ; And then bleep them out .
Bed016_1161	Yeah . ; What color was this in in in the nain nineteenth century . ; Yeah . ; What was this p
Bed015_1015	Yeah . ; Now we 'll go back to s ; OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , ; which is , um , the discourse situation context record ,
Bro027_1059	And , um , ; they 're being fed into these , uh , variants , only Gaussians and so forth , ; and and , uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1195	No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically . ; OK . ; OK . ; And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse .
Bro022_1004	And it 's ; It ; go ahead . ; Maybe you can
Bmr028_544	Yeah . Just Yeah . Just smooth the the output of the of the detector . ; Right . And you recommended using the one with two s maximum of two seconds ? ; Yeah . ; A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ?
Bro010_565	I mean , sorry , ; you estimate what they are , ; and , uh , ; so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum .
Bed005_772	Or you can say " how " you know , " how do I get back ? " ; Trying to ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK .
Bed015_560	It seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the the most basi ; Mm - hmm . ; th those we I think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1955	just figuring out what needs to be done ; then actually the next step is to start trying to do it . ; Exactly right . ; Got it .
Bmr019_931	so I couldn't switch between the audio . ; I I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely , ; which meant in overlaps , I was at a at a terrific disadvantage . ; Right .
Btr002_2366	Or , " That 's it . " ; Yeah . ; Or something like that , you know . ; That people do that one a lot .
Bro014_1564	and and learning a bit about what what , um what it is , ; and , uh , the importance of it in speech recognition . ; And I found some some , uh , neat papers , um , historical papers from , um , Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2157	and I never really got around to it , ; but . ; Do you people ; Uh - huh .
Bmr008_451	So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers . ; OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes ; American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in . ; Now what was this thing that
Bro007_422	Oh that 's probably the ; or ; this is probably channel error stuff ; well , you
Bed011_1068	Yeah . ; So that the the trick is going to be t to take this and pick a some sort of lattice of constructions , ; Mm - hmm . ; so some lexical and some phrasal , and and , you know ,
Bed014_771	Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; I should try to finish it by then . Yeah . ; Oh , right .
Btr002_2506	Uh - huh . ; Because I think it 's communicative of a certain thing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1398	OK . So . ; Another suggestion . ; Yeah . ; Rather than have circle fill in forms , say " Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . "
Bmr031_1561	Right ? ; To get rid of what ? ; Does that ? The mean and variance . Have it be zero mean and unity variance . ; Mean and variance .
Bro007_211	Yeah . ; What happens there is it 's around the same ; and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps . ; Yeah , it 's it 's significantly worse well but Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1079	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; But , yeah , ; I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out ,
Bmr005_672	Right . ; Now , my a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface , ; Uh - huh . ; I I I think It 's it 's a good eh work ,
Bed002_1295	which nobody have has ; because car navigation systems don't really care . ; You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , ; some now do the house number .
Bmr031_58	it was . ; OK , ; so . ; And Chuck gets stuck with the ear - plug mike .
Bmr016_1730	OK . ; Because we they didn't say " TCL " , they said " tickle " . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed016_1138	instruction . ; Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Buw001_915	I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's sort of Landay supplying it ; so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do .
Bed014_868	Yep . ; Bomb proof ! ; Good . ; Oh ! Oh , OK .
Bmr010_168	on mel scale twenty twenty critical bands and then loudness . ; Mm - hmm . ; And four additional features , which is energy , loudness , modified loudness , and zero crossing rate . ; So it 's twenty - four twenty - four features .
Bed014_743	whether anything relevant to the current something has been uh , has crept up in the dialogue history already , or not . ; And , um ; I have the , uh If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there . ; Good .
Bed006_1701	OK . ; It 's ; It 's an a attempt to refine it basically . ; And yeah ,
Bmr031_103	Four ? ; Four . ; Oh . ; Four .
Bmr027_1350	Or she 's getting a good early start . ; Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . ; It 's that the meeting is in July ; so they so DARPA just said do an annual report .
Bmr028_1410	But ; We 're not de - legitimizing the data . ; We 're de - legitimizing the experiment . ; We 're not saying that the data is cheating data .
Bro027_871	The ; Y you have ninety features ? ; i ; I have ,
Bro022_88	Y s ; I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , ; or ? ; Oh .
Bed014_1267	Wel - then t Hans . ; Has I haven't seen Hans Boas ? ; He 's been around . ; Yeah .
Bro017_734	That is true , ; but w I mean , so what you want to do You want to say if uh obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_947	Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , ; right ? ; That 's why we have this little ; I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone
Bro012_534	And for the well - m uh HM they are also around one point five . ; But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed008_946	Yeah , right . ; That 's right , ; so the Endpoint node , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_95	Uh , that was really difficult for her ; and uh ; Because of l all the names , you mean ? ; The names and um
Bro021_432	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Ma - maybe we can I mean , at least , ; um , I 'll t s run some experiments to see whether once I have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matters or not .
Bed009_512	th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi ,
Bro003_1833	So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset . ; Yeah . ; From each language to the superset , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_655	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; so ; so we were coming with all these f various lifters .
Bro016_107	Well , I did write down , ; um ; So , when I was doing I just wrote down some numbers for the well - matched case . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_370	Other way . ; Other way . ; Liz ; Now you 're all watching me .
Bmr021_1002	or rarely . ; Um . But uh . ; Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off . ; Right .
Bed004_620	And that the the that 's the hardest problem . ; So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology . ; The h ; So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is
Bns002_519	Mm - hmm . ; So this node should hear it before . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2036	Oh , god ! ; There 'll be lots of breathing . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . But I I think that still overall you 're gonna have probably three or four or five dominant speakers .
Bsr001_1746	If they can actually do it . ; Yeah , ; Really ? ; that 's pretty
Bed014_978	I I could ; Next week . ; Well , we 're meeting Tuesday . ; I mean we usually meet Tuesday or l like , linguists um , at two .
Bmr007_313	Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; They 're not double counted .
Bro018_835	Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; OK . ; Looking at all the sampling rates to make sure all the sampling rates were what eight K , what I was assuming they were ,
Bro028_895	Mm - hmm . ; uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , uh , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about , ; and it was really just sort of setting of different constants . ; And it would turn , you know , one thing into another .
Bro027_1399	but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ? ; Uh , it ; Mm - hmm . ; No , actually , I think i
Bed014_122	The guy . ; OK , so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech . ; No . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_730	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1834	It 's really cute actually . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_948	Yeah . ; OK . ; Excuse me @ @ . ; OK .
Bmr019_575	So . ; Well , they 're twenty - five cents or so . ; Th - we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a PDA . ; Yeah .
Bed003_977	I didn't think it did learning . ; OK . ; Maybe it did a little bit of learning , ; Oh right .
Bed005_870	Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_463	at least found in TIMIT . ; Um so i it would be a a measure of " are we on the right track with with the the choices of our acoustic events " . ; Um , So that 's going on . ; And also , just uh working on my uh final project for Jordan 's class ,
Bmr023_672	Yeah . ; I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro016_1110	You know , you look at the phone ; and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature . ; Whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant . ; Whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way .
Bmr015_1214	Uh - huh . ; I see . ; One of the ; um , just to add to this
Bro024_742	that you have the problem with this mulit ; a at the beginning we had only this multi condition training of the TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , I I found the same problem .
Bsr001_1007	or in New York , ; in New York . ; high involve high in high involvement style . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1749	Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap ; Yeah . ; which which is you can just tell a person 's m monitoring at two levels ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1071	Mm - hmm . ; I was interested that you chose uh , you know um , the you know that you use ; cuz I think that 's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics . ; Well we chose um , you know , half a second
Btr002_1792	What is that ? ; It 's not a beep . ; Yeah . ; It 's not a bell .
Bro019_1641	as as what you ; Mm - hmm . ; But but yeah , ; you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section ,
Bmr025_443	Ah . ; Oh in ; it 's been recorded , ; For the new one
Bmr011_606	For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that . ; I mean , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can ; And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , ; we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels
Bmr006_1008	Can I ask ? ; It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . ; S ; So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me .
Bed003_1716	Yeah . ; I mean that 's what we wanna check , ; right ? ; Um ,
Bed015_2106	then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper . ; And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there . ; You won't get you won't really get any C P ; T 's , therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is ,
Bmr007_761	Oh , Andreas was ; How big their heads are . ; I mean the the how a person is sitting is ; But if you just
Bro012_48	and in general we like to do that , because of things like this ; and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe ; filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , ; even pretty low speech frequencies , at all ,
Bmr010_197	that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's it .
Bmr008_283	And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds . ; I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent . ; Yeah . ; Well , one thing , so you understand he he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ?
Bmr011_331	Yeah . ; Wonderful . ; Wonderful . ; Um , something I guess I didn't put in the list but , uh , on that , uh , same day later on in
Bns002_1346	Why can't we , for example , think about some mmm , new mechanisms that users could get , uh connectivity by means of other users , and no directly to the base station , ; or , when we have several technologies uh in overlapped in a certain area , why can't we use the closest and the cheapest , maybe , technology , ; or maybe the less power consumption technology , without the user to worry about if he is now using this or the other technology . ; And on the other hand , what are the billing implications of this behavior ?
Bro005_1204	And CPU memory issues . ; Yeah . ; We 've been sort of ignoring that , ; haven't we ?
Bmr018_1328	Yeah , I 'm not too worried about that . ; I was thinking ; But they 're still planning to do like fake ; Scenario - based .
Bmr020_881	OK . ; and , the other thing Chuck pointed out is that , um , since this one is hand - marked , there are discourse boundaries . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_445	Yeah . ; cuz ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's really hard ,
Bmr022_996	And so , we 're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; so we have , you know , some kind of little something ,
Bmr020_1739	So my standard approach has been if it 's not someone close - miked , then , they don't end up on one of the close - miked channels . ; They end up on a different channel . ; And we have any number of channels available , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_1319	And keeping " Other " , ; and then maybe this North Midland , we call it " North Midwest " . ; South Midwest , or just ; Yes I I I think so . Yeah .
Bro003_1507	And then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others . ; Mmm . ; That 's the idea . ; So , uh , it 's gonna take us
Bed003_780	So th some things can be landmarks in your sense ; but they can never be entered ? ; So for example s a statue . ; Good point .
Bmr016_1945	Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes , ; but in any case , um , " numbers " and " NUMS " are a part of this digits task thing . ; Um , now th Then I have these numbers that have quotation marks around them . ; Um , I didn't want to put them in as gloss comments
Bmr019_1658	Uh . ; Yeah . Not that NSA . ; The th the ; It 's network services and applications .
Bro013_15	Uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh Meeting Recorder digits that we tested . ; Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting . ; So . ; The both the uh the SRI System and the oth
Bed013_356	So . ; Yep . ; Um , what 's your input ? ; Well , um , I don't have much experience with uh , conference papers for compu in the computer science realm ,
Bed011_854	you know , so I assume we 're going for the first interpretation , ; Right . ; right ? ; Something like
Bmr030_586	A DVD burner , yeah . ; I guess the real question is , where would we put it and who would do it ? ; I guess whoever records the meeting . ; I mean , it it 's not a big deal ,
Bed016_282	But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , ; Oh , OK . ; the you can observe that all the time , ; Oh really .
Bmr001_12	Is that alright ? ; Yeah , OK , ; maybe I 'll put this thing here then . ; OK .
Bro023_571	So , when they just , uh , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r uh , forty percent , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Fourteen percent , I mean . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_181	Pretty short . ; Shor ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_833	I don't remember the acronym . ; The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . ; And that 's basically what I based the format that I did ; Yeah .
Bed016_462	And give them more money . ; They just want a fun place for them to to work . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed013_953	and Johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the discussed the admission fee , in eh previously , that might be a good indication that , " how do I get to the castle ? " , actually he wants to enter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or , you know , " how do I get to X ? " ; discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance , is a good indication .
Bed009_792	Or wh ; There w ; Oh from from Stuttgart , ; That 's right .
Bro017_929	You would have to modify the mean in the model . ; I you I agree with you . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_355	Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes . ; Yeah , she could tell which one was seven . ; Um , maybe . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_720	but is is it summing signals ; or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? ; I delete the old one , put the new one in . ; Oh , OK .
Bed010_1130	Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah . ; But um , ; I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a ; Yeah , right .
Bed003_867	Excellent . ; Um - And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth , ; so . ; But , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say .
Bro011_444	Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? ; Guess you could , yeah . ; Bin them up into different categories and ; Yeah .
Bro017_113	Oh , but you still have that with the MFCC . ; OK . ; Y yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_75	And I and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of of added , ; Right . ; uh ; Right .
Bmr016_1716	What 's a QUAL ? ; Oh I see , I see . ; Hmm . ; So it 's not gloss .
Bsr001_1377	you know , maybe if if we have common transcription standards and , you know , that it 's all transcribed ; or ; there 's there 's some integration of the standards thing . ; Right .
Bmr023_718	So it 's ; Yeah . ; And I think Don , um Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , ; where we can
Bro022_552	components , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . This is another difference . ; Their normalization works like on on the utterance levels .
Bro025_39	OK . ; Are you looking at one in in particular of these two ? ; Yeah . So the sh it 's the sheet that gives fifty - f three point sixty - six . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_62	It 's like most of the sentences in one tree , ; Mm - hmm . ; and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . ; And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the from the LISP .
Bmr019_570	u Yeah . ; but not by a lot . ; It 's really pretty uh , pretty much the same . ; I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose .
Bmr003_1708	Yep . ; uh , assuming it works . ; Yep . ; And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter .
Bro008_468	And then we we , uh uh , made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things , ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh ; But it was all pretty artificial ,
Bmr025_764	the ; Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X ; and you don't wanna take notes ; and you 're you just wanna
Bmr010_240	Th - the also Adam , before the the before you went away . ; Uh we , um regarding the representation of overlaps , ; because at present , um , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using , ; overlaps are , uh , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , uh , detailed a way as it might be ,
Bro028_503	their , uh , LVCSR system . ; Downloaded the latest version of that . ; Got it compiled and everything . ; Um , downloaded the scripts .
Btr002_656	no ? ; so it 's actually paradoxical in a way ; cuz you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better . ; Oh .
Bsr001_1524	Yeah . ; No , no , ; we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece . ; OK , OK .
Bns001_1319	that there 's some transparency concerning the results ; and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace . ; So that 's the basic idea . ; But really it 's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it .
Bro027_1341	but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? ; But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower , ; Y yeah , oh . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1317	and roughly independent errors , ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's a good choice for ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2259	Yep . ; t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro023_622	you can do that ; I mean , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise ; or if you have a w voice activity detector , uh , you estimate the noise spectrum . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_956	So that 's probably what will happen , ; Yeah . ; but we 'll try it this way and see . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_69	Right . ; That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber ; Come on in . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_298	yeah . ; Except for it doesn't do well on short things , remember . ; Right , so so you 'll have to I ; It will miss them .
Bed015_1865	Maybe . ; Yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like " speaker believes not - P " , ; No . ; you know ?
Bmr016_1644	Yep . ; No , I didn't . ; Seven hundred eighty - five instances . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1293	They 're actually They have the status of events . ; OK . ; Well the " QUAL " can be The " QUAL " is applying to the left . ; Right , I just meant the middle two ones ,
Bns002_1568	Sorry ? ; Wher - where the slides are available ? ; I will send it electronically . ; When ?
Bed013_976	OK . ; And then grep , basically . ; the the point is that you uh that when someone 's talking about a castle , you know that it 's the sort of thing that people are likely to wanna go into ? ; Or , is it the fact that if there 's an admission fee , then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in ?
Bro017_108	And nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement . ; So they agreed that uh there will be a twenty - five percent improvement required on on uh h u m bad mis badly mismatched ; But wait a minute , ; I thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases .
Bed014_391	Hmm . ; Uh , sorry . In a in a friendly moment . ; Same thing . ; Anyway , uh , that we were that we 're gonna try to get a uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week .
Bmr007_973	So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well I I have these other data over here , that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . " ; Yeah . ; Uh Suppose you don't use any of those things . ; You say you have looked for acoustic change .
Bro016_558	I would hope tha I would hope they would . ; Um . ; But , uh , ; it 's true .
Bed014_710	or changing of the probabilities , and - or ; Guess it 's like I g The other thing is , whether you have a m m user model that has , you know , whatever , a current plan , whatever , plans that had been discussed , ; and ; I don't know ,
Bed006_1473	OK . ; Be great . ; and how this can come about , ; nuh ?
Bro023_848	Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ? ; o ; Yeah . ; So there is also a threshold , of course ,
Bmr031_1411	And they they 've now built up a nice piece of software that does ; u um ; has this sort of general framework for a for it ; so that you can adjust it to sort of an any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing
Btr001_286	Oh yeah , ; OK . ; And , um , ; and I 've taken lots
Bed004_450	you know , what are the most relevant things . ; Mmm . ; And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick , is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow that you don't get this combinatorics . ; So that if you decided that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be ,
Bmr013_579	Uh , yeah . ; And . ; So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . ; Yeah .
Bro007_477	E excuse me ? ; Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in Europe . ; Yeah . ; We don't know is happening .
Bro027_26	Um . ; Yeah , it 's it 's interesting . ; I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , ; and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well .
Bro013_125	That the ; Oh . ; So much worse ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_619	so ; um That 's from the user model , ; Oh you mean level of interest ? ; mm - hmm ,
Bmr016_1536	Ah . ; Exactly . ; Exactly . ; Yeah , so the only
Bns003_987	I mean , activities , planning activities . ; Sorry . ; Yeah , ; that 's OK .
Bmr012_1050	and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . ; And that 's the other solution ; and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece ; and the he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece .
Bro004_834	Mmm . ; but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it ; and and we 'll see . ; But but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know ,
Bro005_398	Mmm , with the experiment type - two , ; I first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature ; another feature . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2579	No , let 's let 's not . ; Let 's do simultaneous digits . ; We ; can somebody explain to me why you do digits ?
Bed015_2002	Yeah , right , right , right . ; Yeah , and and there are certainly cases like that . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples .
Bmr018_1319	and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that . ; Right . ; Yeah , it is a good idea . ; Yeah , h uh , J Jonathan Fiscus did say that , uh , they have lots of software for doing calibration for skew and offset between channels
Bmr023_510	So . ; Yeah . That 's right . So that ; OK ? ; OK .
Bed008_298	Yeah . ; And the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse . ; What he has mentioned before . ; OK , so this is w
Bmr007_808	I mean , wh what was the ; The algorithm was , uh take o every frame that 's over the threshold , and then median - filter it , and then look for runs . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_826	Um . ; They aren't normalized after that , ; are they ? ; Mmm . No ,
Bmr003_358	Yeah , a little bit . ; Oh , they do . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro012_978	uh fff ; Well . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures . ; Yeah . ; Um . It seems that after spectral subtraction , speech is more emerging now uh than than before .
Bmr027_1491	And so that 's sort of a ; stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . ; Right . ; We did get our , um
Bmr024_136	And I think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format . ; Yep . ; Well , I think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_52	Yeah , but it takes too much time . ; Mari ? ; What ; What ?
Bro019_1278	Maybe . ; So . ; It 's just a thought . ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_427	Yeah . ; This is the thing I I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the behavior for energy is , uh log energy , is not uh the same all the time .
Bmr009_1532	OK . ; I mean you would have to do something ourselves . ; Well , or use the one that crawls . ; OK .
Bro018_1091	Um . ; Due to Avendano , I 'm taking s um six seconds of speech , ; um I 'm using two second FFT analysis frames , stepped by a half second ; so it 's a quarter length step
Bro013_689	I 'm sorry ; a two second window ; then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window ; and the then it um then things are l more linear .
Bmr002_245	but uh which would have been easier for the of course , for the machine . ; But . Was that an OK pace ? ; Sure . ; It 's kind of weird .
Bro028_346	Right ? ; I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_429	I would think . ; Well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . ; If you do or don't normalize ? ; If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize .
Bmr012_249	we should say something about the glitch . ; He he can say something about the glitch . ; um oh OK ; yeah .
Btr002_534	We were just talking about that . ; They should do that at BART , too , ; because sometimes it 's hard to hear . ; I see .
Bmr002_740	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Good . ; OK . " MATE Mark - up Framework " .
Bro024_1054	which is like ; OK . ; f so ; Mmm .
Bmr012_1017	I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff . ; If we could drop that . ; Yeah . ; So I I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him .
Btr002_773	cuz that 's that 's saved me a bunch of times . ; Gives some good clues , ; yeah . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's very useful in like all senses
Bdb001_965	um ; I think we 're we 're we 're actually just ; We 're about done . ; yeah ,
Bed005_291	Oh , " see " . ; Yeah . ; I mean it 's sort of ; Yeah . Yep . OK .
Bmr024_722	It is different . ; You can't just fold it in as if it 's ; I mean , digits are different , too . ; Right ?
Bro019_1339	Yeah . ; cumulants , ; And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or ; yeah .
Bmr019_839	if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . ; But it 'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your Waves stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; We don't care what what tool you use .
Bmr024_666	Right ? ; So it 's It it I guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . ; So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ? ; I think it 's I I think I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key .
Bmr008_1749	eh in a moment F - seek function doesn't work . ; Hmm . ; and I had an problem . ; Ah , that 's interesting ,
Bmr022_1305	I guess it depends on Jane 's ; Uh , you know , ; if that 's if that model works for the transcripts , then that 's fine . ; But if that pr @ @ um , allows someone to come in and modify while you 're modifying , and they turn out to be changes that , you know , would have been better to wait until your version came out , then that 's really up to you ,
Bro012_270	I think the reason is , ; yeah , I not I ; it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone . ; Well , in for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing ,
Bed006_1762	right ? ; That 's the rich sort of " Resource Description Framework " ; Oh " rich de " ; Oh .
Bmr031_1328	Yeah , I mean we 're doing , uh ; So I should mention , Dave and I have sort of been pushing through thinking in terms of an ASRU paper . ; But I 'm still ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1612	uh uh ; if it 's if it 's voiced , include it , ; Just separate out from the from the normal things , ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Bro004_481	So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here ? ; You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? ; Yeah . ; It 's uh the one hundred number .
Bmr007_727	No . ; OK . ; The wireless ones . ; And even the jacks , I mean , I 'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you .
Bed010_1069	Same with you ? ; No . ; Nnn . ; This Well , I 've I have projects , but then the my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us .
Bed013_867	Oops . I didn't really listen to it , ; The ; I was too young . ; Hmm .
Btr002_2009	because there are like eight people talking to me all at once " . ; I 'm like , " Wow " . ; How about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers i in one meeting . ; Are those What are those like ?
Buw001_2230	But ; Yeah . ; To the pre previous meeting . That 's right . ; OK .
Bed013_1184	Thoughts ? ; Questions ? ; I 'm thinking about it . ; Um
Bro017_724	Yep . ; You modify the Gaussian in the model , ; but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power , ; but in a training what you c in a training uh in trained model , all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant .
Bed006_65	yes . ; And um hopefully it is by by means of Keith that we will be able to get a b a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is ; and um how we can make it work for us . ; Additionally his interest um surpasses um English
Bmr031_321	Um . So . ; Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people . ; But but I think , you know , the main thing is just to , ; uh uh uh uh , it 's not a it 's not a conference .
Bro013_338	I think , yeah , this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best , ; because with the new VAD , it 's very the results are similar to the France Telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes . ; Hmm . ; Huh .
Btr001_431	Right . ; it 's different . ; Much different . ; A lot of the pronunciations are different ,
Bed015_1461	Hmm . ; But , um ; I don't know where he is right now ; but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff .
Bro019_1227	the just the same same way we 're using I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . ; Phones . ; Oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_105	and I have a threshold that ; Mm - hmm . ; well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when if the utterance is , uh , long enough to to continue to adapt after , like , one second ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_85	but Tigerfish thought it was , " uh , just an idea " . ; Now that changes the meaning . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bmr018_420	Well , I mean , it takes it takes long enough ; Yeah , it 's very slow to do that . ; It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the ; I I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly
Bmr026_864	Mm - hmm . ; which is only what ; two hours something ? ; Right .
Bro019_1608	and Well they are much lower . ; If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly ? ; I mean h how is the speech created ? ; It was created from a synthesizer ,
Bro004_1326	It just died . ; OK . ; Yeah , we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server , actually . ; Yes .
Bed009_435	And you just get information and give it to people . ; But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on ; Yep . ; Uh , y y your I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module
Bmr020_1270	and a and adding a tag if that happens . ; So she does the adjustments on those guys ? ; But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins . ; On that meeting .
Bmr005_755	Oh , OK . ; Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , ; I mean , you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time . ; But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know , the right detector .
Bed008_1395	Now this guy he looks at the value of H ; say it 's two , ; and then he just selects the uh thing . ; That 's all there is to say , I guess about it .
Bmr007_337	That 's interesting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro007_293	It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . ; To apply also to in include also the the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those . ; Yes . ; Uh - huh , uh - huh .
Bmr010_1233	We , uh , uh , cou trying to ; That 's fine . ; I 'm finished . ; eh , was p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits
Bmr008_540	Yeah . ; Well , that 's the concept , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_245	Mm - hmm . ; Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? ; Are they supposed to be point five or point six ? ; I think you 're not allowed to
Bsr001_1058	OK , you have two people talking , ; it 's the closest thing . ; But we really should move into the you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real scenario . ; Hmm .
Bed017_583	with that FrameNet base . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; So you you guys never sent anybody else from I U .
Bro017_100	still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , ; but I assume so . ; Because uh we would fight for that , really . ; uh but since uh u u n u
Bsr001_1383	Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar . ; And Yeah . ; And if your task is to just sort of , you know , generally do , um , summary and , uh and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which , uh , that there 's much a difference . ; Right .
Bro017_101	but I assume so . ; Because uh we would fight for that , really . ; uh but since uh u u n u ; at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car
Bed014_1419	So . OK , that 's Tuesday . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Like th that 's the conclusion . OK .
Bro005_1398	Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; Al - actually I should mention ; So if um , about the Linux machine
Bmr022_304	See what he thinks would work best with them . ; I mean , what 's going wrong on the other end ? ; What are they doing ? ; Well , as I said , I think We don't actually know ,
Bro013_49	So there is ; It 's their complete system and including on - line uh unsupervised adaptation . ; That 's true . ; And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember .
Bro010_737	Mm - hmm . ; But it 's it 's i i i ; using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_552	yeah . ; Right , right . ; So we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level . ; So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it ,
Btr001_2698	Hmm . ; Huh . ; one or the other . ; I see ,
Bmr024_1622	We have a I found a couple of old ones . ; Hmm . ; Oh . ; Well , that 'll be interesting .
Bmr020_584	W well , d you couldn't really make everything smaller ; but we s we put ; Put the abstract end . ; Oh , I I
Bmr007_92	It 's not indicated with , um uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that OK , so , It 's indicated to to so the people know what parts of sp which which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others . ; So , I used this mark and , um and , uh uh , divided the ; I wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes , of which we ended up with forty five , and a little bit . ; And , uh you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to sixty seconds .
Bro028_751	Gaussian mixture model . ; OK . ; It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals . ; It 's a , um sort of came out of , uh uh , looking a lot like HTK .
Bro025_172	Uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we didn't have any explicit noise , uh , handling ; stationary dealing with e e ; we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1718	So , and maybe we won't laugh this time also . ; So remember to read the transcript number so that , uh , everyone knows that what it is . ; And ready ? ; Yeah .
Bro007_112	Yeah ; there is something funny happening here because ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_793	Um ; But I don't know . ; Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . ; And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want
Bmr005_683	Yeah . ; because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level . ; I want eh I wanted to eh compare the the transcription . ; But if it takes sixty to one
Btr001_1073	Mm - hmm . ; mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; kinda go " Well there 's two ,
Bmr023_1090	well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net . ; Yeah . ; These nets are trained with particular normalization ; and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it .
Bro021_615	And that 's all I have to say . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm I 'm still hopeful that that
Bed014_416	So anyway . ; OK . ; So um ; Ah , communication !
Bro021_999	No . ; That I mean , that the f top one does not imply the second one . ; The top ? ; Because cuz the log of a sum is not the same as th
Bmr018_1374	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , that was one of the ones that I liked . ; Bring the ; That It not only works , in some cases it was better ,
Bed005_1093	and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ? ; Right ? ; Well . OK , so th so the important point is W not what the G function is . ; The important point is that Um There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT .
Bmr027_1197	Yeah . ; I think I have a pair that I brought from home , ; We have ; but it 's f just for music listening
Bsr001_1846	So basically it seems to be like , uh , ; I mean , if everybody w e u was in the universities collecting data , we are , you are , I mean , sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be , you know , a benefit for everybody . ; It would be great . ; Mmm , mmm .
Bmr022_1103	Yeah , as I said , it 's just a question of , uh , do you wanna have to track down root if you have to make any change . ; But it doesn't have to be root . ; It could be some other user that we all can SUX to . ; That 's true .
Bro018_1201	OK , so it 's then then it 's it 's it 's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the SRI system ; and ; Yeah , ; I mean , as helpful
Btr002_2308	and " And they 're ; I don't know . ; This is a very different thing than most people can relate to , I guess . ; Mm - hmm . The I agree .
Bed004_701	maybe you want to look something up in the GRS , ; but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . ; Based on ; we we have uh
Bns002_179	I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , ; uh , you know , and finally , uh , another non - military applications , where uh maybe a network is available , like for example , a room like this ,
Bmr016_1129	Exactly . ; I do these checks . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bro010_1251	So that ; Yeah , the ; the head , in the way , is really ; that 's what it 's for .
Bed008_1046	But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much . ; OK . ; Right , right . ; Yeah .
Bro003_771	The newer one . ; Where did that ? ; So English , uh , Finnish and Italian are Aurora . ; Yeah .
Bns003_122	and when I get the signal I will ask one more time . ; Nah , but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he @ @ . ; Did the networks have internet connectivity ? ; Yes ,
Bed015_1606	That may be all over the literature . ; Yeah . ; So so by default ; There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a a verb of saying then
Bmr030_189	but ; It was faster than my PC . ; I mean , it was ; Hmm .
Bro014_20	Alright ! ; Doo - doop , doo - doo . ; What 's wrong with ? ; OK .
Bmr019_1136	Just very locally , yeah . ; But but that just ; Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a the word " spurt " originally , ; Here @ @
Bed005_1259	Yeah . ; and we 'll write it down in a flat file . ; No . ; So , i is
Bro024_974	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; Or ? ; so the
Bro027_1216	so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . ; I mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . ; So it 's not the same . ; I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car ,
Bmr031_1628	No , I understand . ; It 's just it it ; No , it 's more that that if you felt something wasn't Gaussian and you were trying to normalize for some kind of , uh , bias of some sort , you might use a non - parametric measure , ; Right , right . OK .
Bmr026_277	Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . ; OK . ; Is that what you mean ? ; Yeah , jus Yeah .
Bmr007_845	Who was it trained on ? ; Uh , I have no idea . ; I don't remember . ; Hmm .
Bro028_736	and the only question is what 's the actual knob that we use ? ; And the knob that we use should ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , uh , unfortunately , like I say , I don't know the analytic solution to this
Bmr008_1135	I Maybe I was missing something maybe , ; but I mean this is something one would try to infer , ; but how do how would you How would you freeze that information about what , uh , ; I mean , we already have these things about someone 's a professor and someone 's a student , or something ,
Bmr028_787	Oh , OK . So then you could use , um You could use , um uh , like Feacalc and s just specify as an output format ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's the point .
Bed006_1114	So if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry . ; Yeah . ; Mayb - yeah . ; You have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there .
Bro023_958	It 's just a thought . ; I d I don't know if it would be ; Yeah . ; Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin .
Bmr005_992	So actually , we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk ; and ; so , you know , Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that , ; now that uh the things are starting to happen .
Bmr018_1110	You said , " Speaking about energy " , or something . ; But that was funny . ; Yeah . ; He he he was onto the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand - held , and trying to get lower power and so on ,
Btr002_1884	Oh man . ; That was really hard . ; Yeah . ; That 's really interesting .
Btr001_2591	Yeah . ; so that we 're sure , ; as you 've done . ; I remember I did that a little bit ,
Bed013_1342	What ? ; Right . ; Right , ; And then the the the miracle that we get out the intention , Go - there , happens , based on what we know about that entity , about the user , about his various beliefs , goals , desires , blah - blah - blah .
Bro022_284	Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either . ; Yeah . ; I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_737	Right . ; Now , we hav the the whole Unfortunately , the whole database is , uh , in German . ; We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it , ; IE the e the shortest k the the more general descriptions of all the objects and , um , persons and events .
Bro021_243	because ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1145	but it 's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of " OK they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here " , ; Yeah .
Bro021_1001	The top ? ; Because cuz the log of a sum is not the same as th ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I mean , as
Bmr009_369	Or they get louder . ; there 's some equalizing in there ? ; Yeah or ; Uh , no we don't have that .
Bed004_475	Yeah . ; Uh , I don't think our friends uh on Wednesday are going to be able to ; Well , maybe they will . ; Well , let me think about whether whether I think we can present this to them or not .
Bmr008_1015	Yes . ; so many things that vary I ; And also we wanna keep it simple and non - evaluative . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_667	OK . ; Alright . ; Did the did they get good results with that ? ; I mean , they 're OK ,
Bro023_1525	If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics . ; And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , ; but if the time frame is long enough , uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , uh , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy . ; I 'm confused .
Bed002_1057	An - Nuh . ; But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete . ; OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be , ; and we have some some data that 's loose ,
Btr001_1852	Right . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , ; I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do .
Bmr016_1557	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's ; I I don't recognize a lot of these .
Bmr031_937	Why don't we just go around , ; cuz we only have a few minutes . ; Didn't you wanna say something about the hardware set - up ? ; Oh , that 's right .
Bed015_2196	and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? ; Or ; We can do it Th - Thursday again . ; Yeah .
Bro018_876	so whereas with our features , he 's actually storing the cepstrum on disk , and he reads those in . ; Right . ; But it looked like he had to give it uh ; even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it uh a front - end parameter file .
Bro021_284	Right ? ; Uh - huh . ; And then ; And and so what 's
Bmr031_906	Oh , how nice of you , ; holding holding the thing so I 'm not ; It was falling off , uh . ; Yeah , thank you .
Bmr009_1626	Well , you want to go first ? Or . ; I c I have to make a call . ; So . ; OK .
Bro005_653	Yeah , ; we still have to work on Finnish , ; um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . ; For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything .
Bed013_973	You can dynamically look up keys , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , so , wait so um , since this since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head , ; OK .
Btr001_2335	I mean ; Do you Have you run across this ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2213	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that that was the whole issue with the LED , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1136	Uh XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to IBM . ; Um , pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription , ; uh next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM , ; Hasn't been sent yet , but It 's getting ready .
Bmr023_70	That was the thing we talked about , I think , before the transcriber ; Come on in . ; Yeah . ; Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out
Bro010_234	And and , uh , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually . ; I mean , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server ; and , uh , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . It doesn't seem like it 's that big a deal . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_817	And so I told I said it would take about a day . ; I 've worked on it for about half a day , ; I have to go . ; so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .
Bed013_69	Mm - hmm . ; in a sper certain way , ; based on certain intentions . ; So in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance .
Bro003_1227	uh , was , um , one day also . ; Uh , ; but on what machine ? ; On a SPERT board .
Bed015_1860	N no . ; Mmm . ; or ; Right .
Btr001_144	Just curious . ; What ; yeah , what did he say ? ; He said some more things about that ,
Btr002_1139	Right . ; Yep . ; U u ; Hmm .
Bmr019_407	Yeah . ; To , uh , the to have have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation . ; But I think it 's an important data point , if you 're if ; Right .
Bsr001_937	Mixing , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I mean there is some program at midnight somewhere .
Bed005_1035	it could be , like This isn't the way it really is , ; but let me say that , suppose someone mentioned , uh , admission fees ; Ah , it takes too long . ; Try let me just say " Landmark " .
Btr002_2988	Mm - hmm . ; Yes . ; Oh , OK . OK . ; And of course , potentially they 're codable ,
Bns002_1424	The the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes . ; And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um Wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible . ; There 's a @ @ for uh current uh uh uh for for fast changes within this network . ; And that means , if you go to slide number three , that we have um the possibility to to um having normal features in the mobile access network ,
Bed005_244	So , in a sense it 's pretty broad . ; OK . ; OK . ; So , if you want to look at the templates , they 're conveniently located in a file , " template " .
Bns001_1262	and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process . ; It 's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet , ; because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible . ; So how to combine these pos uh potential um extensions in the um access networks , and
Bro018_344	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Then maybe I can understand . ; uh times the
Btr001_944	it 's " OK " with a ha a little hatch ; and then , " PRN " and then " m mm - kay " , or whatever it is in quotes . ; Oh , right . ; OK .
Bro010_397	Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . ; So . ; Ye ; Mmm .
Bro028_463	That that could be . ; Yeah . ; That 's what I was thinking by doing this es experiment , ; like
Bro012_1422	Mmm . ; and different ta ; it was probably Resource Management or something , ; um , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall .
Bed008_1482	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; I don't think , ; well you have a
Bed003_1274	Sure . ; And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information , ; the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . ; And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that .
Btr002_2063	Oh , OK . ; Oh . OK . ; Did you guys ever , ; when This happened to me when I first started transcribing ,
Btr001_1610	and I like will change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1262	That 's a pretty good deal . ; and the focus on the ; Don't even really notice , ; do you ?
Btr001_50	One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms . ; Um , because there are so many ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's a field that I 'm not really l very
Btr002_46	Thank you for coming . ; Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time ; and maybe , uh , go over some some ideas about , um , ; well , i the return to the conventions ,
Bmr028_1757	Do we have an EDU meeting at four ? ; That 's fine . ; Hmm . ; Oh , good question .
Bmr016_1849	It was me . ; It was ! ; In fact , it was ! ; Yeah !
Bmr006_1822	Yeah , ab absolutely . ; It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , ; Oh , yeah , sure . ; and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio ,
Bro003_359	So that 's that 's what we 're involved in . ; We might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , ; but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . ; So so I think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language .
Bed010_1004	Yeah be uh ; actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro014_1211	I mean , to first order what you 'd what you 're doing ; I mean , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech ,
Buw001_256	Right . ; I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important , ; OK . ; that might be a query " .
Bns001_1357	Yeah . ; But for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question , " if we would have the money what would we do with that ? " ; Uh . ; So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money , we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know .
Bmr027_1222	So . ; Definitely . ; Yeah . ; It 's made a difference in in how easy .
Bro010_240	So . ; And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . ; No . ; What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , uh , the the the surgical , uh , uh , microscopes and so forth .
Bmr028_760	u un ; Can I have butter on my meeting ? ; Let 's talk about that for a second , maybe . ; What was the question ?
Bro019_1199	Uh - huh . ; But Doesn't help . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I really wonder though .
Bed002_1158	and he does it all in MATE , ; and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . ; So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice . ; Right .
Bed003_782	So for example s a statue . ; Good point . ; Yeah ? ; Right .
Bmr003_2267	Hmm ! ; So I 'm ready to build it . ; Which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_631	And you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , ; right ? ; I mean ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1696	And , uh ; I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ? ; We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff ; OK . That 's , uh , my question .
Bed017_551	But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it . ; And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures ,
Bmr007_796	and so I played with that a little bit , and it works O K , except that it 's very sensitive to your choice of your filter width and your threshold . ; So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not . ; But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore , ; even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness .
Bmr007_597	Yeah . ; Voting for ; Um , o one thing I I wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . ; Seniority .
Bmr008_323	um and then I put " Optional " with a big " Optional " in parentheses , Age . ; Wait , why is that optional ? ; Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1462	But , um ; I don't know where he is right now ; but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff . ; OK .
Btr001_1502	It 's like Well now it 's it m seems more reasonable that they 'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly right . ; OK .
Bro023_643	so " SF " is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum ; Mm - hmm . ; And " N " is the noisy power spectrum . ; And so this is the transfer function .
Bmr012_229	um ; Yeah ; so ; so that 's what we have
Btr001_2685	Oh , wow . ; Yeah . ; And that was like a Stroop test in some ways . ; It took a lot of conc
Bed015_889	I 'm not sure I understand ; but here 's what I th think is going on . ; That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus . ; W uh ,
Bro018_1041	Right . ; and presumably he 's running at some pruning threshold that 's that 's uh , you know gets very few search errors ; but is is relatively fast ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_132	Yeah . ; How did we do on the TI - digits ? ; Very exciting . s @ @ . ; Well the prosodics are so much different
Bed011_527	Well , um , these are all f people off campus s from campus so far , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr011_18	I c I could talk about the meeting . ; Does everyone has everyone met Don ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ?
Bro005_964	But continuous features . ; Not uh uh , hard targets . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_770	But it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say " here are the possible things that you could focus on " , ; cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus . ; Mmm . ; But I think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ?
Bro019_1173	Uh , sixty - two point five milliseconds I think . ; OK . ; And ; I do I did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature
Bmr030_298	So so you There 's a trade - off ; Yeah . It ; It 's kind of a useless one . ; and I 'm wondering what criteria they use .
Bmr012_839	so ; you know . ; Sure . ; Just Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_841	And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends . ; And then he has a second pass which is a modeling a Gaussian mixture model . ; Um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places . ; And what looks like it 's happening is that the even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job .
Bed014_461	but uh but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with " where is the Powder - Tower ? " or whatever ; Right . ; Well . Uh , what was supposed to happen ? ; I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones ,
Bmr020_256	Well , he he made a claim ; Well ; Well ; Yeah , we we have pretty limited sample here .
Bmr031_87	So , uh , you didn't you didn't get an agenda , ; I guess . We 've got the usual ; Well , because no one no one ever rep responded with any items . ; Yeah .
Bro027_662	Ah , OK . ; Uh ; But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , uh , win . ; And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay , you 're , uh , that
Bro024_676	Mmm . ; So . ; I mean , it uh , like , i i ; i It is well known , this this medium match condition of the Finnish data has some strange effects .
Bmr026_726	I am . ; Oh sor ; But I do I don't I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . ; Right .
Bro004_825	Mm - hmm . ; because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate , ; Mm - hmm . ; if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context .
Bmr010_984	I trained them to , uh , f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed . ; This also gives me a sense of ; You know , I can I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . ; But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions
Bed010_698	There 's this EDU ; Right ? ; Yeah ; it 's or or just
Bmr002_176	OK ? ; Well , then , fine . ; Fine . ; Then it doesn't matter ,
Bmr025_615	Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna ; if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . ; Just just the monthly full . ; Hmm .
Bmr007_1138	uh next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM , ; Hasn't been sent yet , but It 's getting ready . ; But yeah , that 's why I phrased it that way , yeah OK . ; Um human subjects approval on campus , uh and release forms worked out
Bmr027_556	Uh - huh . ; If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . ; But that 's not sufficient . ; Hmm .
Bro008_188	I think tha I think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something . ; Yeah , ; this Tuesday , ; yeah .
Bro005_1458	connect the ; My battery is low . ; Well , let 's hope it works . ; Maybe you should go first and see
Bro028_383	because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition . ; Uh - huh . ; And , um , ; i if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good .
Bed006_1269	Mm - hmm . ; and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories . ; And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy ; Yeah .
Bmr016_461	or ; Row , row , row your boat . ; Round . ; yeah .
Bro011_243	Mm - hmm . ; Uh I also um haven't got the code yet , ; I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . ; Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet
Bed011_73	And he has a handout . ; Yeah . ; Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates . ; Yeah .
Bro022_43	but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . ; OK . ; So should I go so that , uh , ; Yeah .
Bro014_1200	the pitch ? ; It 's the pitch . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_113	about what meaning what specific meaning you want . ; So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , ; you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , " the big th " , you you know , " the big the tall dark man " , you know , " walked into the room " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1010	or ; Demo . ; but it somehow connects to uh , remotely to this IRAM board ; which will be doing the real computation .
Bns003_622	Absolutely . ; And , if they are interested in uh , a certain kind of project then it must be related to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing with respect to UMTS , ; I it It will be different thing . ; right ?
Bmr009_1453	And it 's easy on the subjects . ; Yep . ; Now I have one suggestion on the next section . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1232	because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here ; Yeah , I 'm sure . ; Uh , yeah , I I know . ; Right .
Bed016_810	Yeah . ; Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . ; is ; Yeah .
Bro021_1329	This is almost cheating . ; It certainly isn't real - time . ; But if y suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given by the VAD and so forth ; or I I guess we 're gonna be given even better boundaries than that .
Bmr019_1642	So ; Great . ; I sent email when I finished the that one . ; N S A three , I think .
Bro012_391	Is that what you 're saying ? ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bro017_964	Yeah , the sharper the variance , the more more important to get that one right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN . ; We were playing with putting um pitch into the Mandarin recognizer .
Bmr016_817	Entropy coding . ; It just uses entropy coding ? ; So . ; OK .
Bmr015_567	We want some way of specifying , more than looking in the " key " file , what channel and what mike . What channel , what mike , and what broadcaster . ; Or I don't know how to s say it . ; So I mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w as a wireless . ; Yeah .
Bns001_75	and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime . ; So , but , anyway , I would like that Miguel Sanchez will introduce himself a little bit , concerning his background , what he intend to do . ; And Because I discussing with him uh , uh many things concerning , uh , his skills and what the NSA group intends to do . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_278	If ; Which is the structural uncertainty ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I that 's
Bmr011_362	So he might be around . ; Get him to give some talks and so on . ; But anyway , he might be interested in this stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_665	OK . ; Right , I mean , just it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same data . ; You know , ; Yeah .
Bed014_387	there was this , uh thing that Nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that ; Hmm ! ; I was really strong . ; Hmm !
Bns001_359	because I 'm just watching uh you know the sports news . ; So , if I switch If if , because of my motion , I 'm switching , or I 'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network , well , I I want the service to be uh stopped . " ; And this can be some pattern then that some users will follow . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2572	Yeah . Mm - hmm . ; Laugh . Right . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1729	I thought it was pretty funny . ; Yeah . ; I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_516	It 's not just speaker adaptation . ; It 's the whole norm feature normalization process . ; I it 's spea uh , all that is speaker - based . ; You know , so we
Btr002_2862	um , ; and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions , ; or e not enough overlaps , or something . ; Huh !
Bmr002_496	Right . ; But um , yeah , that 's quite you know we 've That 's been done . ; I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1173	Yeah . ; And , uh , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough ; I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back back when Chuck was here ; in early times ,
Bmr005_639	you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ? ; But , by by the moment , I I don't compare , my my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I I want to do it . ; Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks , ; I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .
Bro013_165	Yeah . ; Well , actually we see that the clean train for the Aurora proposals are are better than the multi - train , ; It is if ; yeah .
Bro005_287	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . Alright . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1644	It 's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking . ; I c ; But ; Yep . Yep . Yeah . Yeah .
Bed003_1000	Can w can we see that ? ; How do you write the code ; The c ; or do you actually never have to write any code there ?
Bmr011_1700	Mmm . ; The entire room . ; I had as my fourth thing here processing of wave forms . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1457	Yeah . ; The floor is lower . ; Um , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr019_1245	Right . ; Well , there 's lots of little things . ; Um . ; It 's like there 're twelve different scripts which you run
Bro005_746	taking out means and variances and so forth . ; So . ; Yeah . ; In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design ,
Bed006_992	We have absolutely no means of enforcing that , ; so it would be considered valid if we have an SPG action " Enter " and no SPG schema , but a forced action schema . ; Could happen . ; Whi - which is not bad ,
Bmr031_787	Yeah , right . ; Th - that only takes a day or so . ; Anyway . ; R r
Bmr019_1522	Yeah . Right . ; Yeah . ; It 's , uh , something in ; Yeah .
Bmr014_241	Nothing against you and your hand - soldering ; right . ; but ; You 've never seen my hand - soldering .
Bmr025_374	Yeah . ; Sorry . ; Today isn't June first , ; There 's another one .
Bsr001_1398	that solves everything . ; You know , ; not not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these , um , pieces . ; Uh - huh .
Bed006_371	That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so
Btr002_2832	I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward . ; Mm - hmm . ; There would be a lot of pauses , ; and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something .
Bed005_301	Yep . ; Uh , I 'll tell you why . ; Because it gives a you a score . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_617	Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case . ; OK . ; The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ? ; And that the the that 's the hardest problem .
Bmr010_1301	at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize ; so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap . ; Yeah . ; Um , I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be ,
Bmr011_1094	That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . ; If you do a forced alignment on something really ; Got uh six sixty minutes of ; well even if you do it on something really long you need to know
Bmr002_1291	Mm - hmm . ; but I really do think from everything that I 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying , ; the information retrieval aspects from that . ; Right .
Bmr029_560	Certainly for the the two microphone case , ; which we 're not gonna mess with because it 's another whole deal with the low - quality microphones , ; um , ; we ought to be able to at least tell that it appears that things are coming from a particular direction .
Bmr002_383	I I I actually have one . ; You have one yourself ? ; Well , Sarah has one ; Oh , I see !
Bmr010_1352	Maybe . ; Yeah . ; And , I I have prepared the the pitch tracker now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1096	I I hand - adjusted two of them ; I mentioned before , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ,
Bmr003_965	That 's pretty much true ; but ; it might save ninety percent of the work though . ; but , yes .
Bed016_323	" Looks familiar . " ; I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other . ; Uh . ; Whatever .
Bmr007_588	Right . ; Yeah , I agree . ; But . ; I wonder what determines who gets the floor ?
Bro012_1184	well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have ; that 's something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum . ; And . ; Yeah , so I don't know .
Btr001_73	Yeah . ; also . ; Yeah . ; OK ,
Bed006_262	sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks ; and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them , ; but uh ; the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects .
Bmr013_523	And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . ; Yeah ; They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . ; Are they busy for the next couple years , or ?
Bns003_1011	I invited him and discussed with him his potential work , I @ @ . ; quite sure ; Oh , he was here one day . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1065	and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I did . ; And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now written in Java
Bro011_761	so I think you , ; Octave is kinda like Matlab ; um four point something or . ; If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff
Bro027_1511	it 's a g ; but you know , we just ; No , no , ; but it might not not even be true .
Bro026_833	Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . I 'll ; But , uh Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; support it either way , so .
Bro011_328	Yeah . ; uh what are the variables , ; what we 're calling this one , ; what are the variables that they 're found finding useful
Bsr001_2418	That 's a good idea . ; Oh . ; That 's the reason , ; You should definitely
Bmr018_743	I don't thi I d I don't think that was the issue . ; I ; yeah , that was sort of a side issue . ; The issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels .
Buw001_920	So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , ; Nothing . ; and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou ; OK .
Bed002_897	You wanna m have it more more steps , sort of ? ; Yeah , I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction ; I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . ; All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff .
Bro013_72	We can do something like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Because ; But
Bmr016_74	So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else . ; So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . ; The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . ; When I look at this , that first line is " sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . "
Bmr009_268	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And she 's right , that a that having a having having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here . ; But ; Uh - huh .
Bed010_286	And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . ; And so it 's ; And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said " yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version " . ; So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now ,
Bed011_6	Yeah . ; OK . ; Alright . ; Yeah , let 's get started .
Bmr005_1394	but ; OK . ; You don't wanna do it , cuz ; OK .
Bsr001_1196	Mm - hmm . ; I I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way , you know , Mari probably won't be able to do a ton of collection . ; But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype collection devices or standards , then we could share data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_155	Yes . ; I think you can . ; What could you do ? ; Well , um
Bro027_310	So . ; OK . ; And , uh , on that , I mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those ; And so they 've picked the values .
Bsr001_850	You you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform . ; That 's good . ; Which , uh Wha - Evaluation of ; Right .
Bro010_472	But ; yeah , ; so it 's before everything else , ; yep .
Bmr016_1963	Only it 's spelled out in words . ; So i this is also spelled out in in words . ; Point FIVE , yeah . ; " Point five . "
Bmr001_552	Yeah , well . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's something that that we definitely need to look at with this . ; Maybe we shouldn't 've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try .
Bmr009_1054	I wouldn't know how to characterize mine either . ; And and so I would think I would say , I 've I 've got a mix of California and Ohio . ; I c ; I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same .
Bmr011_1316	Cool . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore
Bro017_664	Insertions . ; Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters . ; Mm - hmm . ; The only of course problem is that there 's an infinite number of combinations
Bro005_692	boy , ; two thousand . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_1603	But , like I ; I think I really , like , think of it in terms of re - transcribing it almost ; Yeah . ; and I only You know , b
Bed011_419	I b My guess is it 's gonna be ten . ; People ; Ten minutes is long . ; I understand ,
Bmr020_1513	and uh in a bad meeting how often ? ; Uh . ; Was is it in a in a what what is the t ; Well he 's saying , you know , that the the EDU meeting was a good good meeting ,
Bmr022_190	and it might work . ; Oh . ; But ; So is this a
Bro019_270	and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . ; So . ; Um , what what about ; I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work ,
Bed017_335	uh , or ; Well that 's not not even something humans ; Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . ; yeah .
Bmr020_711	Pub real . ; real " ; Exactly . ; MTGC
Bro019_761	and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , ; and then I don't think that 's very realistic , ; I mean I th ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_16	oh , ; Oh . Conference call . ; I 'm sorry . ; I know now I know what you 're talking about .
Bed016_709	I mean , that 's what you started with . ; Mm - hmm . ; So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " ; um , that 's actually a little tricky in English
Bmr012_135	Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Anyway . ; I still don't see the problem .
Bsr001_1612	So , ; sort of ; Right . ; Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly
Bro022_897	So , ; I only keep the frames where the two agree that it 's speech . ; So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . ; Mmm .
Bro010_823	And at the at the higher level , ; for every if , ; um ; The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .
Bro015_142	Huh . ; OK . ; Well ; Hmm .
Bmr030_244	Mm - hmm . ; Play the audio corresponding to that , um , um , feature file , ; OK . ; and it 's all like , aligned and stuff .
Bmr002_987	Oh " Deliverable D - three point one " , ; Oh yeah . ; OK , So , so , it 's called " Transcriber " you said ? ; OK .
Bed010_83	Mm - hmm . ; And so we 're doing it via mouse , ; but the whole system was designed to work with this thing ; and it was It was a lot of engineering stuff .
Bro017_969	And this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros . ; So we were getting uh when we did clustering , we were getting groups uh of features ; p Pretty new outliers , interesting outliers , ; yeah , with with a mean of zero and basically zero variance .
Bro011_564	Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now . ; Mm - hmm . ; So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK system for the Italian data ; and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had .
Bro014_463	but trained on , like , low noisy condition , ; like low speed ; and or stopped car ; and tested on high - speed conditions , I think ,
Btr002_1308	Hmm . ; If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things . ; Mm - hmm . ; I can't remember what they were , now ,
Bed005_1415	and ; you know . ; But , yeah , we could look at it . ; Well , I was j
Bmr014_438	That was what I was always planing on . ; So that , you know you get a whole long list ; exactly what you 're saying , ; you get a whole list of things that say " curly bracket laugh curly bracket " ,
Buw001_2052	I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ?
Bed016_834	There was one on on " out " or " out of " ? ; There was a ; Well , it may be just " out " . ; OK .
Bed010_418	Mm - hmm . ; and ; Doesn't matter . ; Um , just any like like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best .
Bed013_1182	And , in this cas and since since it can mean either of those things , it would light both of those up . ; It 's the same . ; Thoughts ? ; Questions ?
Bmr010_100	and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ? ; So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . ; Nnn , yeah . ; And you you might
Bmr030_417	we can send IBM the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape ; And we might wanna do that anyway . ; Because it seems like that 's being a bottleneck and that 's silly . ; It shouldn't be a bottleneck .
Bmr024_106	OK . ; Well , maybe uh , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . ; Someone can fill in Liz and Andreas later . ; OK .
Bmr005_1133	So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . ; It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , ; Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos . ; But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted
Bns001_1182	You have , in one scenario , multicast , quality of service , routing and mobile um networking . ; Yeah . ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_327	so . ; So some of the the top row of things ; What 's what 's " Disc admission fee " ? ; whether they discuss the admission fees .
Bmr009_101	But , you know , uh But , either way . ; PDF ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1704	Yes . ; Oh my . ; Oh my god ! ; Wasn't that a kick ?
Bmr014_131	This this maybe brings up another topic which is um ; So we 're done with that topic . ; The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . ; Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too .
Bmr008_1511	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; yeah , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1390	Hmm . ; the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen ; so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing ; but um um we can sort of
Bns001_1663	and how can new application arise ; which we haven't considered up to now based on this new network function , LAT enrich enriched network function , LAT . ; So , I think it 's worth to to consider something in that way ; Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it ,
Bmr015_774	Or ; But , I I know many people use , eh , low - pass filter to to to get , eh , the pitch . ; No . ; To get the pitch , yes .
Bmr031_1323	and see if if they , um you know , their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that . ; So , um , we 'll see what that , uh , leads to . ; Um . ; Yeah . Other than that , uh ,
Bro015_185	Um Stephane showed me a paper yesterday um where th uh for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the um the number of iterations , that I talked about last week ? ; And , um , so , there was a whole series of those that they had done . ; Mm - hmm . ; They didn't , I don't think , reported timing for those ,
Bmr008_661	and I 've got a few people who said something else ; and these don't overlap or these ; Well - Isn't it I mean , I think that we 're going a little bit in a circle , because I like the TIMIT suggestion very much , ; and I think it 's a question of how to ge incorporate it ,
Bmr008_1676	just by counting them , ; Um And the length ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bmr031_244	the original application doesn't really appl ; I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same the same speakers . ; Well , but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question . ; I just mean that it 's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't that you don't have disjoint sets ,
Bro024_727	because all those numbers were in sixties and seventies ; because we never had any noise compensations . ; Mmm . ; So that 's where the biggest improvement came up .
Bro026_817	OK . ; Mississippi web site . ; Is that a password controlled ? ; Yeah , it 's password protected .
Bsr001_2592	" Computer , ; give us digit strings . " ; Digit strings , ; That 's right .
Bed005_1127	Yeah , it 's a good question . ; Um The so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions . ; Right . ; And , um In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , um , manually , uh , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ?
Bro028_906	the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much . ; And and , uh ; And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow . ; Uh , not just ,
Bed012_721	But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans , ; because I myself am going to be , um , gone , ; but this is actually not really important . ; Just this weekend we 're going camping .
Bro010_524	Yeah . ; Is the estimate of the noise spectrum a running estimate ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1294	But anyway , um based on your uh uh initial scenario I believe because Bluetooth is on one chip , ; Yeah . ; like you have now your UCB buss or whatever connectivity , you will have your Bluetooth connectivity . ; Five bucks .
Buw001_1715	It 's not ; Yep . Absolutely . ; I ; Right . It doesn't it isn't difficult for us to do ,
Bro017_170	Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_459	Actually ; I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . ; Silent . ; Silence starting or silence ending
Bmr005_1216	and it 's typically one microphone , ; in a , uh , uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want . ; Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can . ; But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say " hey you have this panel show , or this you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? "
Bed003_912	Oh , right . ; Let 's see . ; So this is " has door " ; Uh , true , false .
Bmr016_612	Yeah , that 's that 's why I only used the part from use ; Yeah . ; which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels ; Yeah .
Bro012_98	Why didn't I notice that ? " ; Hmm . ; um . So . um ; So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ .
Btr001_701	Sometimes the beginning the person started to say something , ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Really ?
Bed015_2062	You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? ; You can't . ; You have to make separate queries every time . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_1113	He he he was onto the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand - held , and trying to get lower power and so on , ; That was very nice . ; Po - low power ; and Microsoft pops up a little window saying " Your batteries are now fully charged . "
Bed006_189	advertise in their classes as well . ; Yeah ; or even I could you know I could do the actual ; Cuz I mean I I know how to contact our students ,
Bro005_357	because it 's the more difficult . ; Yes , good . ; OK ? ; So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use
Bmr015_415	I thought it was smaller , ; that it was like four or five , ; wasn't it ? ; I I 'm
Bmr019_1189	um , various other things . ; Yeah . These are things that we had Don ; Uh . ; So , Don sort of , um , propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber
Bmr008_1474	Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds ; Yeah . ; or twenty to twenty - five frames , ; Right .
Bro003_1667	I mean it 's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is . ; So probably if we sort of take their ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; probably the on - line line normalization
Bmr009_701	Um . ; OK . ; OK . ; But that 'd be great if if you 're marking those
Bed014_498	and it 's also just true or false . ; If we encounter a phrase such as " where is X ? " , should that set this to true and this to true , ; and the Bayes - net figures out which under the c situation in general is more likely ? ; Um , or should it just activate this , have this be false ,
Bns001_464	It can be done . ; It is just Mmm uh Trying to to to to poi to pinpoint The the possible problems . ; Yeah . ; There are still enough problems i in doing it .
Bed003_1491	Really ? ; Their reputation is very bad . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; huh ?
Buw001_2165	" I found this great corpora . " ; Yeah . ; They didn't have to collect it . ; " Psst . Want to buy a corpora ? "
Bed013_425	Backwards . ; There 's a s diagram somewhere which tells you how to put that ; I know , ; I didn't understand that either !
Bmr012_1016	but ; I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff . ; If we could drop that . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3166	Yeah . ; OK . ; and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative . ; And and sometimes
Btr002_2509	Yeah . ; I don't know what I am never sure whether or not to transcribe , um , a difference with , like , " hmm " , you know , and " hmm ! " . ; Oh yeah . ; Oh . Good point . Yes .
Bmr019_803	Ju ; No , not ; I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_503	And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here . ; Um and that that 's the indicator that we 're getting . ; But anyway , yeah , we 're not disagreeing on any of this , ; we should look at it more uh more finely , but uh uh I think that This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .
Bsr001_675	so so one of our ; Mmm . ; Right . ; our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link ,
Btr002_3433	The time we start digits ? ; So we have to ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_192	Yeah that 's right . ; Yeah , we haven't done that . ; And time how long it takes . ; I I could set someone on that tomorrow .
Bed005_1000	and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude . ; So , uh ; Like , let 's just look at the case when , um , this is actually the the final action , right ? ; So this is like , uh , you know , touch ,
Bmr003_1202	The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle ; So . ; cuz they might get it more right the first time . ; And also we would have control of I mean , we could give them feedback .
Bmr014_516	So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " . ; Hmm . ; And the other one didn't . ; And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .
Bro005_875	French French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually ; so we asked people to listen to the um the sentence ; and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . ; But still ,
Bmr031_242	Do y do we just give up on that ? ; Right . And actually the I was thinking about this ; the original application doesn't really appl ; I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same the same speakers .
Bro016_807	Mm - hmm . ; So your your ; the values that are are actually being fed into HTK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_207	Um , ; so , instead of um , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , I 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . ; And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , ; and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it .
Bns001_849	That ; Yeah . ; No no , uh that is a typical application , I think , ; which is , in principle , also a little bit related to uh to the network .
Bmr021_749	So that 's one difference . ; And the other difference is that in the , uh in the SRI system , the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest . ; And what they do is they d they subtract the maximum ; Huh .
Bmr024_111	So , we , uh we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . ; Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , ; and so it just goes " beep one beep " and then the phrase , ; and then " beep two beep " and then the phrase .
Bmr012_1060	Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us , ; Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too , ; so . ; they 'd
Bmr012_268	But ; yeah ; it ; OK .
Bsr001_1844	And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . ; Yeah . ; So basically it seems to be like , uh , ; I mean , if everybody w e u was in the universities collecting data , we are , you are , I mean , sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be , you know , a benefit for everybody .
Bmr003_2144	s ; so that ; So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . ; It could go either way .
Bed016_893	is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? ; Oh . ; Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , ; we 've thought about that .
Bmr009_589	Yeah . ; and , You know , it 's always an interesting question . ; I would think it 's interesting , yeah . ; It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded .
Bro028_1024	So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ? ; And those filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics . ; And so in fact they 're multi - scale . ; But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like " let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there " , and so forth .
Bed016_1045	How about " I 'm in a hurry " ? ; State . ; It i But it 's a state and the the issue is , is that it may be just a usage , ; Hmm ?
Bmr003_1707	cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing ; Yep . ; uh , assuming it works . ; Yep .
Bed005_183	which " ; OK . ; uh , " today evening " , uh i " Is anything happening in the cinema this evening ? " ; OK . Key words , e basically .
Bed015_240	which is that " designates " isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now . ; Good . ; So we want s " designates " to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects ; but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on .
Bns001_1509	it 's only ; Hmm ? ; And I think ; Yeah .
Btr001_259	And I found that I could ; if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this " ; and then I figured out what they were saying . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1204	Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that . ; Yeah . ; OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation . ; There was another impro another improvement in that
Bmr006_1404	And they had very precision . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Ye - Pretty much . Yeah .
Bro016_454	or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And
Bed015_2104	Grout out the things that that you need . ; Right . ; then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper . ; And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there .
Bro022_1055	so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . ; So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . ; And , uh . So . The results are , like ; So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization .
Bmr003_1872	but it doesn't matter . ; We can do it all . ; we can do it all ! ; OK .
Bed008_363	now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that ; I think we can ; so that the belief - net itself has properties ; and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items .
Bmr019_695	Correct . ; Right . ; Um , but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly . ; Right .
Bmr021_692	Yeah . ; OK . Yeah . I could do that . ; So I assume Tcl - TK wasn't already on the machine , so you had to install it . ; Yeah .
Bed005_729	Mm - hmm . ; You have proper names , and descriptions . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr016_1024	It takes a very long ti ; In the in ; Yeah just to load a transcription ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1200	Yeah , you would know that . ; Yeah ; So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same ; so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way
Bmr007_976	You say you have looked for acoustic change . ; Well , what does that mean ? ; That that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something , ; Yeah .
Bed005_85	which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something . ; Mm - hmm . ; In this case , it doesn't really make sense . ; Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying " I don't want to see the final transcript " .
Btr002_2813	and people , uh , n I have to be conscious of that sometimes . ; Hmm ! ; Yeah , so . ; So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies .
Bro019_1270	but in combination , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it ,
Bed010_118	So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group , ; R uh ; but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it . ; Sure .
Bro016_1099	And the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this .
Bed002_287	OK . I see . ; OK . ; Yep . ; Thank you .
Bed011_512	th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah . ; OK . ; But this is open . ; So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy .
Bro019_1233	But it 's different . ; And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here .
Bed002_1136	That that ; um , ; you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . ; So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .
Btr001_2241	b but that 's not really an example of this , ; because they don't just say " so " . ; Right , ; u Nnn .
Buw001_829	Mm - hmm . ; I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . ; As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , ; uh , and and will include all that .
Bro028_717	We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties , ; and show that , uh , " well , OK , not changing it , playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . But in fact if we did that , it made a a big difference . " ; I wonder if it it might be possible to , uh , simulate the back - end with some other system . ; So we we get our f front - end features ,
Bmr011_777	Hope so . ; Wow . ; But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount . ; OK .
Bmr024_1438	Mm - hmm . ; Um . So , um Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set .
Bro023_982	yeah . ; And , yeah , ; some people also if it 's a negative value they , uh , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the edges and bins . ; For frames , frequency bins .
Bmr027_783	Hmm . ; Uh . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro008_210	and ; Uh , but , um ; Uh , I think , you know , the main reason for having ; I mean , it only takes w to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so ,
Bed013_1197	So w if we have a construction node , " where is X " , it 's gonna both get the po posterior probability that it 's Info - on up , ; Mmm , yeah . ; Info - on is True - up , and that Go - there is True - up , as well . ; Which would be exactly analogous to what I 'm proposing is , this makes uh makes something here true ,
Bmr012_526	Baah . ; Sheep . ; Sheep , ; right .
Btr001_1142	because ; Yeah . ; Thanks . ; Well , I took the bus for part of the way .
Bro014_149	Yeah . ; And so we 've got it ; now HTK 's compiled for both the Linux and for , um , the Sparcs . ; Um , you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , um , it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a a Sparc and points to the right executables .
Bsr001_958	I 've heard that that that sometimes . ; But it 's it 's OK , though . ; I think in in ; It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know , completely informal conversational speech .
Bmr015_595	and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . ; And , um , I discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things , ; which , um , ; one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this ,
Bed017_521	So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ ; So , you 're not ; I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_878	Right . ; Uh . Right now I don't think if it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped , ; because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_715	and retry the MSG and things like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah we we have a big list .
Bmr027_394	Need to get it right . ; I mean , there 's no way to get around ; I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work ; except for an additional email just saying they got the email .
Bro005_1279	some point ; uh , we say , " OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . ; So now uh um what 's your newest version ? " ; And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better
Bmr011_1544	which is , um , uh , uh , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar uh y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . ; Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather ; Mm - hmm . ; but that 's what he wanted me to show him .
Bmr008_160	uh , the data , so that , ; you know , his XML thing ? ; You got the Data Type Definition the Document Type Definition p part that it 's can s be used for relational things , ; Oh .
Bmr021_772	and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results . ; Um , but you know . So the the results are ; um ; Where should I start ?
Bro015_133	Mm - hmm . ; And it was not better than what we had before . ; And ; Then he tried to put the on - line normalization and it did not improve further ,
Bro013_239	just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system , ; if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . ; It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_675	Uh , ; Too bad . ; You should get a T - shirt that says that . ; OK .
Bmr028_6	I think we were recognition . ; Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the ; I mean , I sent you a couple things , ; although I don't remember them .
Bed006_1035	I see . ; and the buying event you know at which however that looks like , the place f thing to buy . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bed002_221	um , and ; focus on that object down ; Oh , I can actually walk with this . ; This is nice .
Bmr014_419	Yeah . ; i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier . ; Absolutely . ; I agree .
Bns002_560	Uh , well , we are assuming that uh mmm all the all the transmissions are bidirectional . ; I mean , uh you know it depends . ; It depends mainly on on the antenna gain and the transmission power and the receiver uh threshold . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_991	Oh , OK . ; And then , the discourse history can t tell us , " yeah " , or " no " . ; OK . ; And then it 's up for us to decide what to do with it .
Bed003_1428	You know ? ; Mm - hmm . ; and it it 's fifty steps , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2103	No , yeah . N Yeah . ; Oh , oh . ; It would just intru it was an intrusion . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_238	Mm - hmm . ; just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system , ; if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . ; It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high ,
Bro022_129	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . ; So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard ,
Bed010_633	Hmm . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .
Bmr025_837	uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do ; but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure ; but we could at least try it out . ; Well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else ,
Bro027_1239	And and did an other numbers stay the same ? ; Insertion substitutions stay the same ? ; They p stayed the same , ; they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower .
Bro022_939	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . ; I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_55	Channel one ? ; Yes , OK . ; OK . ; So uh I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh from OGI
Bmr001_635	we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more ; because we 're not gonna have that many meetings ; Mm - hmm . ; and this is a pretty tiny amount of data .
Bro012_74	uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation . ; uh ; Did somebody notice it during your talk ? ; uh No .
Bro022_866	Yeah . ; So , your point is will be to u use whatever ; Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_248	I think you 're not allowed to ; Yeah . ; That 's supposed to be point six , for the self - loop . ; Yeah .
Bed016_1080	" I 'm out of sorts now ! " ; Right . ; Like " I 'm in trouble ! " ; Well I when , uh just f u
Bed002_278	You need to sign some stuff and read some digits . ; Well , you can sign afterwards . ; O or later . ; You have to al also have to read some digits .
Bro017_406	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh ; that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors ,
Bmr010_758	Stop breathing ! ; It it 's going to be imperfect . ; You 're not gonna get it perfect . ; Yeah . Uh - huh .
Bro008_282	So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . ; The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to to declare a standard . ; So ; you you you will be you will become experts on this and know more far more than me about the tha this particular standards process once you you go to this meeting .
Bed015_616	Oh , yeah . ; uh , I I mean , that that 's my feeling that that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what what 's going on . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro025_719	And , uh , some things tended to cluster . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? You know , like stop stop consonants clustered really well . ; Hmm .
Bro019_872	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter . ; Is the signal is is a signal substrate .
Bmr021_1001	because ; or rarely . ; Um . But uh . ; Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off .
Buw001_1251	Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . ; Hey . ; Ah ; Yeah .
Bro021_1260	This is one of the approximations that I am doing . ; Per per per utterance , ; or per ? ; Per utterance . Yes .
Bmr029_359	because we know that ; I mean , in fact , we excluded them previously from ; Yeah . So we want to do the same same thing . ; Right .
Bmr021_372	And low and behold I gained three g three gig of space ; and um , you know ; Wow ! ; Did you have to re - nice one of the processes to make sure that " shorten " ?
Bed002_1119	But that 's that 's fine ; an and um , ; all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . ; So they they have worked very hard .
Bmr003_275	and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? ; Right . ; The ; It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution .
Bed005_1019	I mean ; Enter , ; View , ; Approach .
Bmr003_1515	That 's true . ; Right . ; Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " . ; I know .
Bmr019_328	Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think . ; OK . ; The I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using . ; Maybe it 's the Bell Gram .
Bed003_1694	So that looks good . ; Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , ; see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . ; And I talked to Liz about this
Btr002_2344	Mm - hmm . ; The Germans do this I think in particular . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1001	Thilo 's is as good as any , probably . ; Um , and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments , to ; and and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo - speakers . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_495	I mean , so people use them in panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in in sort of , ; Uh - huh . ; uh ; and , uh , those if
Bed010_561	Are are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position of of the direction relative relative to the speaker ? ; For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . ; We can say um " park in front of the car " as you come beh you drive behind the car . ; In Hebrew it means " park behind the car " , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you .
Btr002_3310	But not in terms of replacing , like , this string of undecipherable fragments . ; So , ; Oh , right . ; Right . Oh yeah .
Bmr020_1306	OK , good . ; Yeah , I mean we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow . ; I mean the detector , this ; Yeah .
Bro019_214	Mm - hmm . ; and when you run P - make , uh , on your Make file , you can give it the dash capital J and and then a number , ; Mm - hmm . ; and that number represents how many uh , machines to use at once .
Bro010_187	And the people who have longer latency don't . ; So . ; Huh . ; So , yeah .
Bed010_432	OK . ; Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape ; and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this . ; Yeah , that 's
Bro019_1601	Mm - hmm . ; But but uh , in your case ; um , you know ; Actually you have peaks that are not at the formant 's positions ,
Bed009_130	Should we already set a date for that ? ; Might be beneficial while we 're all here . ; OK ? ; um What what does not work for me is Thursday afternoon .
Bmr021_648	Oh great . ; Actually someone I just got an email this week from someone as ; Isn't that great ? ; Yeah I re responded to sh I have already responded to him .
Bmr015_659	OK . ; Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , ; just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , ; Yeah .
Bro010_308	So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . ; Yeah . ; So it it would probably feel different ; Right .
Bmr019_1453	And so so you can you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do , ; but , you know , they they they had something specific . ; But , one of the reasons I have Chuck 's messing around with with the back - end that you 're not supposed to touch ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_650	there it is . ; OK . What 's the next thing ? ; Yep . ; e
Btr001_998	so it 's not quite so ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; but I don't change it back if it 's there ,
Bed006_1263	right ? ; in in which the things that go into a particular You have categories at the top under action schema ; and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type . ; So I guess what 's the function of having it up there too ?
Bmr012_1298	Great . ; Um that 's a great idea . ; Great . ; Super .
Bns002_211	because one is interfering with the other . ; OK ? ; We are ; uh I think I 'm not telling it yet ,
Bro007_383	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_405	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , those are e extremely efficient ; and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it .
Bed004_361	and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination . ; Um , and then if you go up , ; Robert , ; Yeah , so um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person .
Bro024_1743	and and and dependent on this additive constant , it is s better or or worse . ; Yeah , ; that 's true . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1013	Yes . ; OK . ; Under so o under action schema there 's a list that can include both both things . ; ye Yeah , they they would both schemas would appear ,
Bed006_617	if you 're displaying them . ; OK . ; So we don't have to worry about um ; But uh it 'll tell you that this is what 's showing in Heidelberg and there you go .
Bro014_1080	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Two thousand and fifteen hundred . ; Above , um it seems that
Bmr011_1065	I mean , if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , uh , you know , par paragraph of of talk , ; I see . ; uh , I don't know how they do this . ; Um , we actually don't know which piece goes where .
Bed008_1363	No . ; So you can view these as gone . ; OK . ; Probability of
Buw001_284	I mean , they 're something . ; It 's a a kind of output you 'd like . ; Actually ; Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks .
Bmr027_571	uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about ; because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people . ; W ; For this set , I 'm not worried ,
Bmr020_182	and he talks a lot . ; we just ; Well we have now , ; One participant .
Bmr016_593	yeah . ; and it 's ; Let 's see , th ; I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad .
Bro028_1004	But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say . ; Greedy . ; So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right . ; I mean , i i in truth , both pieces of this are have their analogies in stuff we already do .
Bmr019_1307	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Well , my ; Well th th the other thing that that that yo that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that , um , you know , strictly enforced ,
Btr001_2002	but I 'm just kind of going , " I don't know what any of these acronyms are ; Yeah . ; and no idea what you 're talking about . " ; And there was a whole set of meetings that are like that .
Bro025_430	Sometime we we change two two things together ; and But it 's around maybe it 's less than one percent . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1346	If you already assume " well , OK , they paid money " , and now you think , OK , what what great thing you want to do , then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to m do . ; Yeah , but we have no eh current no public funding , ; No . ; OK , everybody 's paid here .
Bmr030_825	But , um ; Yeah , it 's full in there . ; Have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got ; Mm - mmm .
Bns003_819	and , um ; So , hopefully this work will be go on . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ,
Bmr002_1288	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; I mean You know of course , Rosaria 's pursuing this this area ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_143	and she 's saying ; you know trying ; So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1830	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; If I use , eh , the LDA filter that are training with the noisy speech , that hurts the res my results . ; So what are these numbers here ?
Bed011_131	OK . ; Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_601	or are y ; No , no , no . There 's some I mean , I just there are there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things . ; Yeah . ; Actually , I wanted to mention There are two projects , which are international , huge projects focused on this kind of thing , actually .
Btr001_1174	Tha - that 's so funny . ; Little bit of treats . ; Hey , they would . ; Oh that 's true .
Bsr001_190	no , no . ; But I mean , it 's ; So you 've implemented radio buttons . ; It looks pretty slick though .
Bro014_482	They they compute the relative improvement first ; and then average that with a weighting ? ; Yeah . ; And so then the that that makes the highly - matched the really big thing .
Bmr006_1481	If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , ; and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . ; We still have to do this , too , right ? ; Right .
Bro021_803	n ; Maybe you have to standardize this thing also , ; noise estimation , ; because all the thing that you are testing use a different
Bro014_1067	OK . ; So . ; And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred . ; Oh ! OK .
Bmr009_1183	N m Yeah . ; Yeah , or Boston . ; Or Boston , yeah . ; I can't do it , but
Bmr020_1356	Stress test . ; Mm - hmm . ; How interesting ! ; Yeah .
Bro023_842	Mm - hmm . ; which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_661	and straight features to HTK . ; And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK . ; Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr027_668	And , um So , ; if we make it a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much ; Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , ; if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .
Buw001_2071	cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this ; and said that those are nothing like these meetings . ; Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data . ; And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,
Bmr019_1869	um , without a lot of background noise , ; Yeah ! ; And it ; so I 'm just not sure
Bmr023_1046	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean these were all different databases and different you know , in HTK and all that , ; Yeah .
Bmr019_389	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know if we wanna use that as the ; Uh .
Bmr002_895	Right . ; Here 's another thing I got . ; Oh , so this 'd this w is probably what the L D C uses . ; I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D
Bmr025_251	Tony Robinson ? ; Do I mean Tony ? ; I guess I do . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_91	That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down " speech researcher " or or something at that granularity . ; oh . ; So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is . ; um I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be .
Bed006_1619	or ; Yeah . ; So I mean clearly there 's I can talk about the um the parser changes on Friday at least , ; OK , Bhaskara will do the big show on Friday .
Bro010_317	by by , uh , playing around a little bit , ; going more into the past , ; or something like that . ; We t we talked about that .
Bmr011_318	What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech in . ; But that 's not working at the moment . ; OK . ; I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies , uh normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels .
Buw001_699	so that later we can do other things with it . ; Yeah . ; So so to address what what Adam 's saying , ; Mmm .
Bro024_775	Yeah . ; And these artificial distortions uh , I have the feeling that they are the reason why why we have the problems in this multi - condition training . ; That means the H M Ms we trained , they are they are based on Gaussians , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_754	Just remembered a joke . ; because you get a sense also of posture . ; What people were wearing . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_525	Or , uh , ; Right . ; You 're just talking about playing it and recording it , like , real - time ? ; bad .
Bro014_22	What 's wrong with ? ; OK . ; It 's April fifth . ; Actually , Hynek should be getting back in town shortly if he isn't already .
Bmr014_1202	leave it on their voice mail . ; Any sub - word level thing . ; Any sub - wor ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr027_102	Right . ; Uh . Yeah . ; We probably should have talked about it , ; cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth ,
Bmr019_198	And try it with TI - digits ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_221	Yes , that 's fine . ; That 's fine . ; Exactly . ; And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .
Bro026_750	Yeah , the SVM thing was an HMM also . ; It was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like ; Yeah , this is a g ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1347	Why do you ; No just kidding . ; I don't know . Like ; How do I how do I come at this question ?
Bro021_722	So I was actually that day I was thinking about d doing something about the Wiener filtering , and then Carlos matter of stuff . ; And then he showed up ; and then I told him . ; And then he gave me a whole bunch of filters
Bed003_1178	Yeah . ; Right . ; Very future . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1710	Shall we read some digits ? ; tea is tea is , uh , starting . ; Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again . ; Let 's do it all at once .
Bmr023_382	The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . ; Now there was , uh , I g guess ; So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation ; f for just very few days you were away .
Buw001_1724	You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . ; So , sure . ; OK . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , ; I need to email him , uh , my shipping address
Bmr007_1082	Actually , I saw a uh a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone speaking Japanese , and was bowing . ; Yeah Yeah . ; you know , profusely . ; Oh , yeah , that 's really common .
Bmr020_163	In term ; One ? ; Wow ! ; OK .
Bmr005_128	That 's his major ; I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours ; pretty much , ; or ?
Bed015_434	Uh , I 've had it often enough . ; So , anyway . ; Well he w he went to college here . ; Oh , yeah , I forgot .
Bro022_831	It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . ; But but ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_163	So . ; What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? ; Hopefully . ; OK .
Bed014_610	so that ; um ; It would already be higher in the context . ; th that th the the the conditional probability that someone
Bro027_384	that 's fine . ; Should be OK . ; Yeah , it compiled fine actually . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1314	But it has to be hand - labeled first ? ; but ; Uh , well , yeah . ; Because , uh well , I mean once his his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way .
Bro019_119	and , um , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . ; So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , ; and um And that 's a simple way to get started using using this . ; And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use .
Bmr010_377	So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; S OK . That 's that 's a good point .
Bmr023_809	huh ? ; Yeah . ; But the PLP features work um , uh , you know , continue to improve the , ; OK .
Bmr001_750	You would send I mean , uh a transcriber is used I mean , I don't know , assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting , ; No . ; right ? ; And so they they just have to indicate that the speaker changes .
Buw001_1653	So then just email you ? ; So y ; Sure , sure , sure . ; OK .
Bro023_673	Yeah . ; It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise . ; Uh - huh . ; And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way .
Bed011_931	I mean from my point of view I 'm I 'm trying to care about the syntax , so you know ; Well that too , ; but um You know if th if we in if we you know , make sure that we get them talking about temporal order . ; OK .
Bmr021_601	No but I think just to be consistent we should also , I mean , have the same conventions , just in case you want ; This ; will it ? ; Right .
Bmr007_44	Um and Uh , Adam has some short research issues . ; And I have some short research issues . ; Um , I have a list of things that I think were done over the last three months ; I was supposed to send off , uh and , um I I sent a note about it to uh to Adam and Jane
Buw001_1719	Right . ; i You should ; so we might as well just do it . ; Absolutely .
Bmr002_1307	I mean ; Are you certain ? ; Lea ? ; No .
Btr001_2659	Cuz now I 'm looking at this and I realize I don't know the answer , ; is , ; um , ; sometimes when people are reading " zero " , they say " O " ,
Btr002_1335	I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked . ; Mmm . ; But it was difficult finding them for some reason . ; Yeah !
Bns001_810	That 's all what I think about session management , ; like part of in proxies or is it en embedded in application level protocols ? ; But it 's really higher level . ; Right ?
Bmr028_881	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant .
Bed012_286	s So where are we ? ; We 're discussing this . ; I don't think it can handle French , ; but anyway .
Btr002_2332	Mm - hmm . ; whatever . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr016_1778	Oh I see . ; And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_652	Are we are we are we sort of ; Sure . ; we talked out about what we 're ; Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is what is what eh OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we 're in a situation where we can with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording .
Bed011_1087	and we have to do it , ; but ; Yeah . ; For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah .
Bmr015_135	Yeah , I would , uh , tak do the easy way , ; Yeah . ; OK . ; yeah .
Bmr018_552	I would like to try to do something on digits ; but I just don't know if we have time . ; I mean , it 's due next Friday ; so we have to do the experiments and write the paper .
Bed009_704	Which is , you know , uh uh utopian ; completely utopian at the moment , ; but slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh contingent . ; Hmm .
Bro019_786	or is it done on the FFT bins ? ; Um , ; Does it matter , ; or ?
Bro005_1012	but the best few or something ; You want the most promising group from these other experiments . ; Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? ; Mmm ,
Bed013_1014	and dynamically , then look up u stuff . ; OK . But you 're still doing look up so that when the person So the point is that when the person says , " where is it ? " then you sort of say , let 's go back and look at other things and then decide , ; rather than the other possibility which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things ; You know like w
Bmr010_114	So ; so anyway , I just reporting that . ; But , uh , uh ; OK .
Bmr009_1256	So . ; I mean we we ; Right . ; That 's true .
Bmr022_223	See , I should listen . ; Yeah ? ; Hmm . ; And you know , since there are no more than , you know , ten speakers or so per meeting , there 's plenty of tone space .
Bns001_1120	Yeah . ; so , I 'd I rather would like to ; Yes , that 's right . ; And do you have some comments on it
Bmr009_827	Yeah , I ; Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms . ; yeah . ; The the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits .
Bmr022_1274	Uh - huh . ; You can mark a file as as " you can't check this out " . ; Oh . ; So
Bmr002_1392	Well , this is , I mean , compared to the way people normally do , like , discourse stuff ? ; you know , it 's like you got your ; I mean they 've gotten away from w reel - to - reel tapes , ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_17	Temple squeezers . ; On your temple ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1147	no , we did the Liz talk . ; Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed010_217	huh ? ; Yeah . ; What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who 's interested , ; we can even make a sort of an internal demo ,
Bmr031_644	Then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; Uh , OK .
Bed015_428	OK . ; So , uh , right afterwards I 'm back . ; OK . ; What ?
Bmr024_1204	So so , when So I I had I ha ; That was a quick response . ; So , we had reached the point where ; I 'm well rehearsed .
Bro010_477	I mean , if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain ; but but , uh , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain ; Yeah . ; and
Bro023_779	Yes . ; we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better . ; OK . ; So , that that was just the , uh , reason for doing that experiment .
Bmr006_212	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's that 's my point . Which which includes both top - down and bottom - up .
Bro021_1252	in order to calculate the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech . ; So , I 'm I 'm not following this perfectly ; but , um , ; I
Btr002_2579	I 'm like " it 's just laughing " . ; Good . ; Yeah . ; Well done . Well done .
Bmr013_167	Uh , I th no I think we got under a percent , ; Oh really ? ; but it was but it 's but I mean . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . Uh , but . But , uh , sort of pulling out all the stops . ; OK .
Bro026_979	I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , ; but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further . ; You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_285	Yeah . ; But it but ; But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus . ; It - it 's different people is the is the core thing .
Bns002_53	uh ; Maybe it was my fault that I assumed that the pointer of Miguel concerning UMTS services was deployed to everybody , ; but it was only sent to me , ; so in the meantime everybody got , I believe , this pointer from me ,
Buw001_1078	Yeah . ; an ad addition to their database . ; It 's kind of nice . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_1007	so that uh the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . ; You know what he means ; but isn't that funny sounding ? ; " We ordered more wireless . "
Bmr007_123	I , you know , my I had this script figure out , um who was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , I didn't look at the ones involving three or more . ; And , um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who who else , ; and if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get the totals for an individual . ; So , um If you look at the bottom , those are the , um numbers of overlaps in which um Adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look
Btr001_63	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Uh - huh . ; but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated ,
Buw001_374	Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that ; Um . ; because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface ; and he 's looking at the query in in
Bmr007_1027	I was thinking about doing that originally to find out who 's the loudest , ; and that person is certainly talking . ; Yeah . ; But I also wanted to find threshold uh , excuse me , mol overlap .
Bmr006_845	to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before ; Yeah . Yeah , I I don't think we were asking for that . ; OK . ; We were jus just trying to understand
Bro004_784	um ; Yeah , but mmm , I mean , the ; the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network ; and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions .
Bmr023_780	So that 's So that 's not the problem . ; That 's not the problem . ; Yeah . ; No .
Bmr008_1418	On the overlap category , is that overlapping of speakers only ? ; Yeah . ; It doesn't include some of the other sounds ? ; No .
Bns002_547	and it is that both the RTS and the CTS packet uh , have a field , a control field where the total length of the data packet is shown . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; when you hear one uh CTS or one uh RTS packet , you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or , that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive You know the length .
Bmr007_155	That 's right . ; Yeah . ; And I 'm you know , I 'm I don't see a point of singling people out , ; Excuse me .
Bro014_100	uh , ; even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster . ; And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's ; And when you have your final thing , we go back to this .
Bns001_934	Yeah . ; That 's or CDMA or whatever that 's uh , yeah , probably a thing that has to be find out . ; Yeah . ; I don't know what statuses .
Bro007_133	Oh OK . ; No . ; For that for that we ; Oh .
Bmr028_693	is p is p ; Sorry . Beep . ; Well , OK . That 's the point . ; So it 's Jane that we have to coordinate that through .
Bro022_771	Well . ; First of all , the boundaries might be , uh like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . ; Uh . ; So removing more than that might still make a difference in the results .
Bed011_255	So , " Go to place " and then give them a choice , ; you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say " yeah this is on that " go to big - ish place " , ; this is what I would do . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2479	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Well ; I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy ,
Btr002_840	You know ? ; That 's true . ; I think that would be useful . ; Hmm . Yeah .
Bro013_732	No . " O " " O " " O " ; " O " " O " " O " and " zero " are two ways that we say that digit . ; Eee . ; Yeah .
Buw001_448	No . ; I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . ; No ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1404	That 's good . ; Yeah . ; Fine by me , fine by me . ; Sure !
Bro012_252	Point It 's supposed to be point six . ; Yeah . ; But changing it to point five I think is ; which gives you much better results ,
Bmr022_915	Th - d ; Yes . ; Or what do they ; Yep .
Bed015_1197	So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were . ; Yeah , basically . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed016_508	Anyway . ; Oh , in the presentation here . ; Yeah , that 's what he was talking about . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1800	It may not be it ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1635	But sometimes it 's not visually easy . ; Yeah . ; And so ; I 'm
Bed011_100	The release form is over there in that box . ; Alright , fair enough . ; And um And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . ; They they pick a couple ,
Bed016_825	professional linguists , ; they haven't ; Uh . ; there was this whole thesis on " out of " .
Bro013_139	It ; If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Alright .
Bed008_728	yeah . ; Maybe should be renamed into physical state . ; Or fat user fatigue even . ; Hmm .
Bro021_1257	Yeah . ; And never change throughout anything else ? ; Never cha ; This is one of the approximations that I am doing .
Btr001_487	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , ; cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1921	so . ; Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think . ; No . ; Good .
Bed010_655	Mm - hmm . ; Those are two - point . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_237	and then and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed . ; And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ? ; Right . ; Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end ,
Bmr014_1032	There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , ; and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . " ; Hmm . ; Well that 's more open than I realized .
Bed008_33	That 's funny . ; and then as a uh separate but related task ; uh particularly Bhaskara and I were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do . ; Once
Bro027_687	so you could start pulling back , ; but ; Yeah , ; l
Bed008_1157	This and also , I mean , the other places where , ; like for example consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift ; Right . ; so even
Bmr003_538	So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? ; Yeah . ; Let 's . ; OK ,
Bed013_1003	yeah ? ; Lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it , ; Mm - hmm . OK . ; and lots of people go to attend a performance .
Bro010_620	The ; They just look in the past . ; I guess it works because the noise are , uh pret uh , almost stationary ; Pretty stationary .
Bmr030_347	Hmm . ; so . ; Right . Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1464	Dodged that bullet . ; Yeah . Nicely done , Liz . ; A woman of few words . ; But but lots of prosody .
Bro026_218	And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . ; And that 's hard enough . ; I mean , I don't think we really ; I mean , we 're trying to deal with that .
Bed015_1417	discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , " oh , when you focus something " then ; and , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1216	Yeah , ; so the median filtering is fixed . ; You just change the threshold ? ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1652	I 've already written some notes here , ; so I ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , right . Uh
Bed012_305	right ? ; We u ; This is i That 's what you s it seemed like , explained it to me earlier ; w We we 're we wanna know how to answer the question " Where is X ? "
Bmr019_587	because they 're really not bad . ; I mean , if you 're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they they they you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr008_456	was it Steve ? ; Somebody was telling us about asking about uh , ; Where you lived between the ages of ; Yep . Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem
Bro011_143	Mm - hmm . ; and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you ; and they were sort of waiting for you ; and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves ,
Bro028_1054	in which you which ; I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . ; So , you you you you pick the best feature . ; And then you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it .
Bed010_946	OK . ; It really is . ; Nobody believed th th that ; Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know
Bmr012_1126	See , look . ; so nail the chairs down . ; um and I don't know identifying somehow ? ; Yeah .
Bro024_1487	maybe ; right ? ; maybe we might do it before , ; yeah .
Bro022_826	Yeah . ; So if you could get at some of that , uh ; So ; although that 'd be hard .
Bmr014_1069	you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just ; See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can . ; It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1051	And from there to the appropriate decisions . ; So another one of these primitive , what are called " image schemas " , is uh goal seeking . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this a notion of a source , path , goal , trajector , possibly obstacles .
Bro012_1496	And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data . ; So it 's either one , four , five , six , ; uh up to eleven , ; and then it skips
Buw001_254	Right . ; uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . ; Right . ; I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important ,
Bed009_526	b but that I think that that uh point has been realized ; and it 's it 's not really um been defined yet ; but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is . ; Mmm .
Bro028_388	Uh , and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve . ; So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis ; puts in some degradation ; Uh - huh .
Bmr022_570	Cuz there 's cases , even after Jane listens , where , you know , we have ; Right , ; h ; an expert can't even tell what they 're talking about .
Bed003_935	Did we w ; Yes , ; that 's not good . ; That 's kind of annoying .
Bed003_1401	you know ? ; Um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , ; so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve . ; You know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ?
Bro003_565	because you Well , some phonemes are not , uh , in every languages , ; and So we plan to develop a subset of the phonemes , uh , that includes , uh , all the phonemes of our training languages , ; and use a network with kind of one hundred outputs or something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_1022	which is uh E P ; F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva . ; Great . ; Probably we 're connected to them .
Bmr026_1213	Vast majority is from the input unit . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_733	and that 's going to be more just you and me , ; because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh , ; Killing machines ! ; reasoning machines .
Bmr028_1654	Mm - hmm . ; Um , right . Uh ; Yeah . I mean , it 's just you know , the microphone is intended for certain adjustments . ; Well , we should be getting new equipment in , so we don't have to use the earplug any more .
Bed009_103	OK , before before you got put to work ? ; Yeah ; Great . ; OK , so that 's
Bed015_1690	And we need all the same machinery . ; right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Robert .
Bro025_720	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? You know , like stop stop consonants clustered really well . ; Hmm . ; Um , silence was by its own self .
Btr001_1337	I didn't get one either . ; I think those show up in Tigerfish too , ; cuz I think I 've had a couple of Tigerfish where I 've had to break them up . ; Where they have li
Bmr002_306	OK . ; Well , hang on . ; Oh ? ; That 's not the first question .
Bro023_975	Uh . ; Yeah , I 'm just saying that 's like the opposite . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_497	But I you know , of certain types . ; Now if it 's just backchannels , people may be doing that with less intention of being heard , just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels , ; in which case that those might there may be no upper bound on those . ; I I have a feeling that backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard , uh , don't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural I think , to backchannel if in a multi - audience you know , in a multi - person audience .
Bed012_83	And , ; all the possible outputs , too . ; OK . ; So , we have , um , for example , the , uh , Go - there decision node
Bro018_254	Oh yeah , in training . ; Still , ; Uh . ; Well actually , so this is a test that you should do then .
Bro004_737	Mmm . ; And uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary ; and one for another phoneme at the other side . ; And so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct
Bro012_492	Sorry . ; Yeah . ; Oh yeah . ; For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four
Bmr002_1379	Oh . ; Oh , I see . ; for bigger meetings . ; OK .
Buw001_1160	and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . ; So , ; And what ? ; I 'm at your disposal .
Bro024_1092	No , I think I I used this scheme as it was before . ; OK . ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2681	Oh . ; Mmm . ; Oh , my ! ; Yes .
Bro018_696	OK . ; So . ; Did you find any more mistakes in their tables ? ; Oh !
Buw001_11	No , uh , that that wasn't recorded . ; Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears . ; Yeah , I know . ; It just it really hurts .
Bmr008_1637	Hmm . ; but those are close enough to the ; You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there 's overlap then you should do quite well there . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_1474	Yeah , ; well if there 's a house available or place to ; Well , I mean i i if if ; Yeah , I hope .
Bmr024_185	Well , you know , actually , are we having them ; " Seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two " . ; Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? ; Yes .
Btr001_2253	When ; When you say something ; Oh , just just ending with " so " . ; Yeah .
Bro028_45	So , that 's fine . ; Two thirty . ; Yeah . ; So that 's the system that 's described on the second point of this document .
Bmr022_370	Well , it 's sequential . ; Or a beep and the number , and then and then you just do the the num th you do it as a d a digit . ; Right , you would go sequential . So unless you got pretty unlucky , ; Uh , right .
Bed005_808	Oh , yeah . ; I mean , uh , we could take all the standard metaphor examples and make question versions of them . ; OK . ; " Who got kicked out of France ? "
Bmr010_458	I 'm keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible . ; Yeah . So is it cuz with any luck there 'll actually be a a there 'll be collections at Columbia , ; collections at at UW ; I mean Dan Dan is very interested in doing some other things ,
Bed003_570	Observe nodes . ; So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes ; Yeah . ; Go ahead .
Bro027_1414	Yeah , so it 's sort of like ; The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA . ; Yeah . ; It 's
Bmr007_303	No , it wouldn't . ; It would be considered as an overlap in the first one . ; OK , so that 's good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , ; That 's that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is
Bro022_888	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's it 's not a ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_1724	Of course . ; Like it 's not ; On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I ; So this this happens in the very first one .
Bmr031_1254	You know , I 'll bet You know , Bush went on this European trip recently ; and they told him there that they get more vacations . ; Yeah . ; So he came back here and thought " oh , I I can afford some more vacation too " .
Bmr001_158	Yeah , I mean , you know , we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it . ; I mean . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I think um I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or you know .
Bed013_203	It 's a ; Uh , ; cuz I went and looked at it ; cuz I was thinking , that could not be right ,
Bmr010_919	It 's just a it 's just a word . ; We train it like any other word . ; It 's just a word in the language model . ; Cool .
Bmr010_1305	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but but you don't want to keep , uh keep knocking at it if it 's if you 're not getting any any result with that . ; But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things ,
Bro027_933	In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all . ; Oh , yeah , I wasn't necessarily saying it should be better . ; I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel ; Uh - huh .
Bmr010_933	it didn't work as well . So . ; Huh . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_2035	Um ; Mmm . So it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , ; but I just won't be at them . ; OK .
Bns002_644	Yeah , a cellular phone and a car . ; but it has not enough power to transmit something that can be heard here . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_409	because they would know their place . ; And we have plenty of digits data , ; so . ; Yeah .
Bro016_864	Yeah . ; It may be entirely off ; and and it may be at the very least it may be quite different for MSG than it is for mel cepstrum or PLP . ; So that would be
Bro024_1834	Are these with the clean or with the noisy ? ; This is with the clean . ; OK . ; With the noise I have worse result , that if I doesn't use it .
Bed013_198	Yeah . So what we actually then need to do is is write a little script that changes all the settings , ; you know , go goes through all the permutations , ; which is we did a ; didn't we calculate that once ?
Bmr012_192	I ; was that did that did that recording have the glitch in the middle ? ; I 'm puzzled by that . ; I oh oh , I see .
Bed005_131	The uh , that 's not a lot . ; Yes . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro015_86	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's next week , yeah . ; When is it ?
Bro010_51	Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; But ; So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , uh , IIR filters that have the same frequency response .
Bro005_98	because without delta we use seventeenths seventeen frames . ; Uh . ; Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . ; Uh , so this is training the net on French only ,
Bro007_407	Uh so ; Mmm . ; uh H yeah . ; Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?
Bed008_690	which would include his money and his time and and his energy ; Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . ; Right . ; It does .
Bmr010_576	This is wonderful to have a direct contact like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; uh Well , th lemme ask you this .
Bmr025_910	Yeah . ; like " I better remember to " ; Action item . ; Yeah
Bro023_62	but rather than them coming up and telling me I figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know , all of us . ; So , um , ; why don't we why don't we start with you , Dave , ; Oh , OK .
Bro004_940	So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago ; instead of ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bmr031_76	Sure . ; and after that I 'll be Europe for , uh , several meetings ' worth . ; Uh , you folks 'll be gone for a couple of the meetings ' worth in in Europe also , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1422	But I think ; Yep . ; and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that I mean , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . If you had three or four it 's Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_779	Hmm . ; But it 's just , you know , the the body ; He agreed . ; you know ?
Bmr031_1244	So I 'm kind of in the middle of that . ; And ; hopefully by the twentieth , the twenty - third . ; Twentieth .
Bro003_976	And test - C is a , um , mismatched channel . ; And do we do all our training on clean data ? ; Um , ; Also , we can clean that .
Buw001_1518	Yeah . ; Right . ; that 's , you know , research project for year four or something . ; Research , yeah .
Bmr011_428	Yes . ; Um , is there ; I mean b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . ; He needs to uh , leave for uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight
Bmr008_1330	Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done some kind of normalization ; and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible . ; Yeah . ; And the other thing is that , if that isn't @ @ uh so much of the issue , then probably
Bmr019_834	but but in terms ; So I so for for one of the N S A groups . ; Mm - hmm . ; And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one .
Bmr008_773	Yeah . ; Right . ; Interesting . ; these were all settled by very different type people ,
Bmr008_1242	I think you don't need to have that much structure built in , and that would be less time - consuming to do it this way first , and then find out what structure 's needed . ; Yeah , maybe not . ; Yep . OK . ; what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this ?
Bmr008_1155	Otherwise , they would it would be possible to have a higher level thing . ; But I mean , there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't , and there are some things that happen in between meetings , ; Right , but that example was not ; That 's true . That 's true .
Btr002_2561	Maybe . ; Yeah . ; If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too . ; Yeah .
Bed017_703	And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . ; In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , ; even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left , ; so , uh , they think the money 's coming .
Bro014_348	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns002_162	So uh the idea is that even when these nodes are not moving , they can start and stop working at uh , let 's say , higher pace . ; Then , uh what will happen in a in a regular network , uh in a network where you don't have or either mobility or uh this uh on - off uh rate , high rate . ; Mm - hmm . ; Let me go back to your uh uh example .
Bed009_239	Or " that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something ; and that you usually do inside of buildings " and so forth . ; These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved . ; And if the action planner does something with it , great .
Bmr020_820	Yeah . ; So ; OK . ; Alright , then I 'll hold off on that and I 'll wait for you
Bmr006_896	Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . ; And , um , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and ; Sorry . ; And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models .
Bmr014_915	So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it . ; Well I guess ; So so so ; Yeah .
Bro005_262	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , PLP ; Eighty - eight point six .
Bro003_1648	Yeah , OK . ; Um , ; yeah , ; I I just
Bro023_1083	What is it the , um , France Telecom system uses ; for Do they use spectral subtraction , or Wiener filtering , ; or ? ; They use spectral subtraction ,
Bed015_664	But the second one seems to be useful ; but we might not need a notation for it ? ; We don't have a notation for it ; but we might want one .
Bmr029_804	So , basically , Dave , so y for you to get your processing going , you need the list of the , uh , wave ; Well , I guess it 'll dep ; you 'll you 'll we 'll need to get the segmentations . ; Yeah .
Bro027_222	Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . ; And But if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set ; I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora , ; we have all those parameters just set as they are .
Bed013_414	Yes . ; Good . ; Was he supposed to harass me ? ; Yes .
Bro024_1213	There first , a threshold on the probability @ @ That puts all the values to zero or one . ; Mmm . ; And then the median filtering . ; Yeah ,
Bro017_1185	OK . ; So i What is it ; So we should do that . ; Yeah we sh
Bro027_1877	Anyway . ; Might be . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro011_320	And and S Shawn , yeah . ; Oh . ; So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? ; I see .
Bmr011_1471	Do they still meeting regularly ; or ? ; Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not ; but they are no longer recording .
Bmr019_433	Uh ; So , I mean , it doesn't you know , it 's sit ; Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's ; OK .
Bed015_1368	Yeah , there there are other things . ; Causal stuff we absolutely need . ; Mental space we need . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_470	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there ; I could swore uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point ,
Bro013_147	Mm - hmm . ; But the thing is , if you have a huge ; in other words , do word models ; But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones .
Bns002_845	Right . ; Yeah . ; like for example , an automatic , uh acknowledgement . ; Some protocols used uh in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet some of them use , an eh acknowledge from the receiver ,
Bmr009_112	Oh yeah . ; doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . " ; and then you can play around with the measures . ; Oh yeah .
Bro008_68	So , we 'll we 'll hold off on that a little bit . ; I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad . ; But but , uh , um ; And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh nine percent , or so , improvement .
Bmr027_309	Hmm . ; Right . ; Oh . ; Here .
Bro005_1142	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So you you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L ; Yeah
Bro017_940	Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's predictable . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr013_75	cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . ; So I 'm I think it 's fine , that part . ; There is there is ; So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ?
Bmr003_401	I hadn't thought about that . ; Unless they added close field later on ; but , um , I 've listened to some of those data ; and I , um , I 've been I I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up .
Bmr008_1589	Uh , for both , ; yeah . ; For both . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1329	Yes , ; and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version . ; Good . ; Good .
Bns003_62	And now we have an expert . ; But it 's ; Yeah . ; So the first computer I had to
Btr001_2011	those were really hard . ; Oh , yeah . ; And they 're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see , ; Really hard .
Bmr014_290	So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . ; Right . ; I 've already done five or six sets . ; OK .
Bro027_1227	Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , actually to s eh , what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases .
Bro011_224	No , no n we have n we have do the experiment ; only have the feature the feature but the experiment have ; Yeah . ; we have not make the experiment
Bed015_325	but the point of , um , ; I mentioned in the last meeting , the point of having something called " nominal expression " is , um , ; because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? ; So you wanna , you know you sort of have this problem like " OK , well , I 'll put the word " , uh , let 's say , the word " dog " ,
Bro004_1306	um , not much problems with that . ; OK . ; Computation ? ; It 's OK .
Bed006_1359	right ? ; It 's more like you say " I want to , uh I want to do an Enter . " ; Well only one of ; And then you 're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that .
Bed015_353	Right . ; But , uh , ; Right . ; I just know that this is Like , we didn't originally have in mind that , uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form .
Bro022_583	I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . ; OK . ; But I think I think they they don't just have triphones . ; I think they have a range of of , uh , dependencies .
Bro024_1234	OK . ; How how big is it ? ; It 's a very big one . ; I don't remember .
Bed006_1642	Yes . ; Yeah . ; t to have kind of a detailed example . ; Yes . I 've I 've I 've I guess I 'm on record for promising that now .
Bed010_747	That 's cool . ; And so this doe This is , uh ; First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about ; and I 'll do this this test on you guys as well .
Bmr031_954	So , wha what 's your question ? ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; Are they like these ,
Bmr011_1748	That that may be true . ; But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bmr008_871	Right . ; um And then you can ask these other questions as well , ; but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place ; and that therefore they 're
Bed009_233	And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was . ; And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . ; So if it can make a good suggestion , " Hey ! " ; you know , " that person doesn't wanna enter .
Bmr031_278	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there . ; Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their backchannels
Bro003_1898	Um . ; Right ? ; I mean , if if in fact that is a better thing to do , should we leverage that , rather than doing , um , our own . ; Right ?
Bmr029_852	I I think I have I have the models , ; I have I have , ; um ; let 's see , um
Bed013_440	But that 's what you get for coming late to the meeting . ; I 'm sorry I didn't mean to ; I 'm sorry . ; I 'm sorry , oh these are all the same .
Bmr002_769	I don't know . ; Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things . ; What they 're doing is trying to bring together ; and they rate things .
Bmr019_1706	Oh ! ; Oh ! ; Oh . ; My my last meeting about meetings .
Bmr018_1676	and then they 'd make a comment , and one person said , well - known person said , um , you know , " Before you dismiss forty - five years including my work " ; Forty - five years of research . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_433	OK . ; I don't I don't think so . ; OK . Well , holidays may have interrupted things , ; cuz in in in
Bro005_601	So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do . ; Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms ; because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_452	Where where you 're sitting . ; Oh ! Not not the quality or anything . No . ; n ; Right .
Bro026_486	Yeah . ; But I don't think the storage is so big for that . ; Right . ; I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net .
Bro003_2056	Yeah . ; It sort of gives you your the best you could hope for , kind of . ; Mmm . ; Mmm ,
Bed009_1066	they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . " ; So th the and this is an again attempt to get very wide coverage . ; So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_978	So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where it was later found that several of the s microphones were turned off , ; Mm - hmm . ; um ; and this must become a problem especially with non - speech - meetings .
Bro026_553	What about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation , ; Feature net . ; the , uh , Wall Street Journal part ? ; Right .
Bns002_1199	and it 's only for uh direct sequences spread spectrum . ; OK , DSS . ; OK . ; OK .
Btr002_212	Cuz it 's kind of just the end of that the ; Mm - hmm . ; Would you put a period after " so " ? ; Right .
Bmr013_352	Yeah . ; All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced . ; Uh , if you 're gonna add the features ; it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you
Btr002_1043	So it 's ; I 'm actually used to ; I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now . ; OK .
Bro012_1497	So it 's either one , four , five , six , ; uh up to eleven , ; and then it skips ; and then there 's some at sixteen .
Bmr031_822	OK . ; It combines categories . ; So when we say " transcribed " , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM , ; Oh .
Bro011_430	And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it ; and it 's e but it ; I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , ; whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know , linguistics students ,
Bro011_393	that people have done studies like that w way way back ; right ? ; I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of ; Yeah .
Bro023_1179	yeah , ; if if it If you listen to it ; uh , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing . ; And if you f if you re - synthesize these spot sounds as , like , sounds ,
Bro012_858	Uh - huh . ; And so , in principle , you if you remove that source , then , you know , you can ; I see . OK . ; So would the major effect is that you 're gonna get is by normalizing the means ,
Bns001_1772	and maybe I will stay here only s four weeks or five weeks . ; So it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when I am leaving ; and if I stay longer of course we can go on ; but nevertheless I rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody ,
Bed003_540	So . Um . ; that 's always warping on something some entity , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1742	and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people , ; and he was like , " I I I I I I I I I " ; Oh ! ; And it was I mean it was kind of sad
Bro019_509	So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here ; Yeah . ; and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is . ; Yep .
Bro017_1115	It might be that uh ; Yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_488	because uh Dave Johnson said that DD was getting accessed frequently . ; Oh . Uh - huh . ; And it shouldn't be . ; Right ?
Bro024_1571	But in I mean , in the real thing you 're not gonna be able to measure what people are doing over half an hour or an hour , or anything , right ? ; and ; So you have to come up with this number from something else . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_309	Oh . ; That 's what happened . ; Well , the the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should , ; Oh .
Bro017_939	It 's predictable , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's predictable . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_973	Yeah , ; sorry , it 's a uh short meeting , ; but , um ; Well , I don't know .
Bro014_892	Or is it a system where you just pick some thresholds ? ; Ho - how does it work ? ; Right now we just are trying to find some features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1273	or ? ; Eh . with us ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_857	But obviously we would rather , you know , try to figure out what 's what 's , you know ; Well , I don't know . ; I mean , maybe maybe that 's what we 'll do is is s u e ; We can do anything we want with it .
Bro007_532	Mm - hmm . ; Uh we won't be changing the training on anything ; so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs , ; so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after Tuesday
Bro007_585	Mm - hmm . ; Oh I have yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too ; uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1053	So , like " did the French system use Tcl ? " ; Right . ; That 's a good one . ; Actually what I would have come up with was w w " What was the web address of that thing " ,
Bro010_1083	Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr027_1514	and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , ; so that should be interesting . ; What 's the name of the meeting ? ; Uh , it 's ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding , or something like that
Bmr005_888	Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think I think it 's ; Yeah , he 's it it doesn't take a long time . ; Right . ; I just thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development .
Bro008_565	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yep .
Bro003_1767	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_426	It 's just ; I mean , you think you think if you ; What 's the purpose of the ; Training s Training speech recognition systems .
Buw001_625	Yeah , different ; Uh , y ; just to take pictures of who 's there , ; where the microphones are ,
Bro003_23	uh I mean not that there 's anything defamatory about uh eight five seven or or anything , ; but ; Uh , anyway . ; OK .
Bed009_1059	So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance ; and say " Aha ! ; th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal . ; The goal is this ,
Bmr002_1097	Right . ; So at this meeting with Liz I you know , I mean ; I I do I 'd like to I like that stuff . ; Sure , sure .
Bed005_1408	That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess . @ @ . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute . ; I mean , you 've been around enough to ; I mean
Bro005_1304	Mmm . ; presumably uh , in a in a day we could turn around ; uh , taking a new set of things from them and and rescoring it , ; Mmm .
Bed003_1620	yeah . ; Maybe we can ask him about it . ; Who 's talking on Wednesday ? ; Mmm .
Bmr008_1585	that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that . ; I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it it 's it it may not be normalized enough . ; Uh - huh . ; For b for both , for eh the frame energy and eh residular LPC eh energy too .
Bmr016_2231	and I 'm not sure ; Yeah . ; I mean I 'm sure about that , ; but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done ,
Bmr019_649	Alright . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . So I 've I ; So tha that 's exactly what the P - file is for .
Bmr028_1321	Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are . ; So ; Yeah . ; I mean , I don't know how you get them into the vocabulary ,
Bmr013_847	it drifted into the afternoon , uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . ; And , um , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , ; so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s uh , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , ; and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that .
Bmr020_987	Yeah , ; uh ; I think Jane tightened these up by hand . ; OK ,
Bmr018_967	Yeah , or some , you know , dummy reject mod ; So blank for blank for silence , " S " ; " S " for speech , " X " ; " X " for something else .
Buw001_2003	but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic ; and also the political ; Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_100	um . So . um ; So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . ; One of the things I was I mean , I was trying to think about what what 's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts ; one was , that spectrogram that we show is O K ,
Bed013_195	like you know , everything 's exactly thirty percent . ; No ; Mmm . ; Yeah . So what we actually then need to do is is write a little script that changes all the settings ,
Bmr022_627	It might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly , ; which are the , you know , function words , ; the common words . ; Well , actually , you know , there 's an even easier way .
Bmr014_698	Going to a web site is easy , ; but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web . ; Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper . ; I have one question .
Bro012_937	OK . ; So . ; Where 's th ; But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one .
Bmr008_1282	Was there some suggestion that they might soon , or ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So so , they 've transferred the responsibility to someone else .
Bmr031_831	So . ; We need different color pens , definitely . ; And that I think that that status thing is kinda old actually right now . ; Oh , that 's
Bmr018_1356	Mmm , yeah . ; but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works . ; Uh , so in in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with ; Right .
Bro004_412	I thought there was something like that , that he showed me last week . ; We 'll have to wait till ; we get ; Yeah , that would be interesting .
Bdb001_388	So you re - run a recognizer , ; you want to recompute your features , um , and then keep the database up to date . ; Right . ; Or you change a word , or you change a utterance boundary segment , which is gonna happen a lot .
Bro024_1367	OK . ; Yeah , possible . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_1426	No , getting the coefficients , ; for each channel . ; Know what numbers . ; Yeah , that 's no problem .
Bro026_872	Um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have . ; Um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1928	This is just really i it 's so interesting to me , the the specific experiences of of having encountered these data in this way . ; Does , um Did anybody else wanna say anything about ; I mean , just weird things like before ; like , I had kind of a weird thing happen ,
Bed005_1162	So . ; Is ; Mmm . ; Oh , right .
Bro023_1549	I see . ; Mmm . ; on the on on the bunch of uh fifty frames , right ? ; I see .
Bed015_567	You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you . ; I think . ; Yeah . ; But , you know , whatever ,
Bmr028_887	So , it may not ; I mean , it 's gonna be bad , ; Right . ; but , uh , it may not be , like , " won't decode " kind of bad .
Bro027_406	And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years . ; Oh , OK . ; So . ; Wow .
Bed003_338	OK . ; so . ; I see . ; There were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee ,
Bro021_712	OK . ; some silly stuff . ; And , um , the other thing , uh , was , uh , uh ; Well , Hynek showed up one suddenly on one day
Bro018_988	And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that , ; so you certainly could do that easily . ; But the fundamental difference , ; I mean , there 's other small differences
Bed004_773	yeah . ; So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case , ; right ? ; but I don't yet
Bro004_85	OK . ; Let me give you a black screen . ; He 's facing this way . ; What ?
Bed005_440	So if I now say " Write , Goodbye , " it should do that . ; It sho it creates this , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro018_639	You get you get either a zero or a one . ; Um , uh ; there are there are pap ; Well , basically , it 's it 's um you you get a distance measure at the end of the day ,
Btr002_3363	and then anything ; Some of them already have tags from some previous , uh , modification , ; but anything that doesn't , I just go through this list , and I I k tag it right then . ; And so , in one in one in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred instances of this .
Btr001_618	Yeah . ; cuz I think I think as women it might be easier to differentiate ; Well , there were fewer women , too , ; but I I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys would have had
Bro003_1065	Yeah , ; so , there 's not really a limit . ; What it is is that there 's there 's , uh it 's just penalty , ; you know ?
Bro018_330	and something like that ; to know exactly what they are doing ; because maybe that we can have some ideas ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_488	we say " well you know how come ? " ; Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_523	And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on on that particular set , ; Yeah . ; uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ? ; Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?
Buw001_308	I actually want to say something about the note pad . ; Yeah ; So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . ; Hmm .
Bmr022_1235	I mean , ours to sort of transcribe and annotate . ; The the p the point here is that it would be nice t for there to be one repository . ; And if they wanna make changes , they can do that . ; Yeah
Btr002_1288	It 's a nice standard task , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and you have lots of different voices ,
Btr002_611	So Adam 's ans that ; Mm - hmm . ; then it becomes a matter of , Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range . ; And , I didn't really have the sense that it would .
Bro003_52	Yeah , that 's good . ; Yeah . ; You 're alright ? ; Cuz it 's full .
Buw001_1957	th ; That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , ; because of all these classroom ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1030	Thirty - four . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , so it 's possible to get very short latency .
Bro019_294	you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , ; and it takes forever to even log you in , ; Yeah , yeah . ; and you probably go , " screw this " ,
Bmr008_387	You know ? ; People He ; Well , I think maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age . ; They can always lie .
Bro028_867	Huh . ; And and that that , um , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ? ; I don't remember that . ; And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah .
Bmr001_128	Right . ; The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything . ; But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on . ; And , um running the program .
Bmr021_276	Get a special phone for that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the door - slam phone ? ; I guess ,
Bro005_743	uh , ; yeah , ; Mmm . ; taking out means and variances and so forth .
Bmr019_1179	It 's just ; so it could actually contain several meetings . ; Um . ; And the second column is the channel .
Bro019_857	So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace , ; I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_832	So , region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest . ; " Where did you live ? " ; I mean . What you said . ; you know , " where where wh where did you live ? " ,
Bns001_400	That 's not network related . ; I see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea . ; Um . ; It 's only to set up i u
Bns001_1445	And if I really have an IP application , where I need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of QS will be available in the rest of the internet . ; So how can I map these things uh to the UMTS stuff ? ; And what is the trend towards UMTS to the first generation ? ; And how it is possible to map this one to this technology ?
Bmr030_372	Yeah . ; Right . ; We knew it would be longer to have multiple groups . ; Ooo . Yeah .
Bro022_10	we were ; Yeah . ; Uh , uh , we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point ; and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done .
Bro003_1705	I mean he 's doing he 's working on other things , ; but to to do something on this project . ; So the question is , " Where where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? " ; Um ,
Btr002_831	Yeah , some ; And otherwise you have to drag it . ; Yeah , some timebins are humongous , ; Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it .
Bmr003_1733	Oh , I guess I did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz it 's the speakers the same . ; And then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker , uh , con continuation .
Bed004_135	Because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless , ; we have to move her closer . ; Is she mispronouncing " Anlage " ? ; Is it " Anlaga " or " Anlunga "
Bmr006_476	Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's interesting . ; I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ?
Btr001_707	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that happens a lot . ; Yeah right . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_783	We need to give Brian the beeps file , ; Right . ; so I was gonna probably put it ; We can put it in the same place .
Bmr003_1271	an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale . ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Good .
Bmr027_1087	Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " . ; But really it 's " QS in advance " . ; I mean , I I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . ; OK , then you got ,
Bed015_1752	it was something like factivity . ; I couldn't really remember what it meant ; so I took it out . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2216	I wanted to ask one question about the the nature of the design . ; It 's terrific . ; Th - Given that the overlaps are up up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas , um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule ; where if a person , you know , the that there 's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the
Bro016_728	Shouldn't be . ; or Shou ; They should be less so . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1121	Right . ; So pi ; They 're just being very nice and good neighbors ; A free gift .
Bmr029_502	The the other difference that we 'd have to take care of is that , ; uh yeah , we we don't have a mike that , uh , is particular to a person . ; And so we 'll have to do some clustering , ; and that 'll be another another , uh , issue , too .
Bmr031_797	to download . ; Things are slower there . ; Definitely true . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1151	Right . ; That was all mumbled ? ; I think Microsoft is ; Yeah .
Bed017_252	and then plan a route . ; Um - hmm , um , well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner , ; nnn , nnn , ; Certain certain beauty in it ,
Bro023_685	Mm - hmm . ; I see , ; I see . ; I mean , in the long run you 're doing the same thing
Bro026_1005	I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments ; Right . ; because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate . ; Yeah .
Bro003_822	Oh . Oh OK . ; Um , basically , they they corrupted it with , uh , different kinds of noises at different SNR levels . ; Ah . ; I see .
Bro023_1683	I think we 're OK . ; So . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1670	Hmm . ; For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do . ; Well , you do . ; Ah , for discourse , yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr023_360	eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . ; So I I think that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . ; Oh , yes . ; I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever .
Btr002_2123	and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . " ; Yeah ! ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro022_558	We have a system that does it on - line . ; So , it might be ; Right . ; it might be better with
Bed010_92	mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb , ; You have to switch it on . ; Mm - hmm . ; so I 'd uh have to add " am walking , "
Bed009_750	yeah . ; Yeah , ; ah and so things must be simpler ; I see ,
Bsr001_2483	The order , ; yeah . ; Just the order , ; OK ?
Bmr027_1192	They 're they 're they 're they 're pretty inexpensive . ; Yeah , that ; We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . ; I 'm using one of these .
Bmr008_66	So that what I have is uh ; Status ? ; Which might in af affect the discourse aspects . ; So , go ahead .
Bro004_1353	And uh and uh a nice amount of memory . ; Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine . ; And if we can do things on Linux , some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1131	It 's , like , friendly , ; The d the data tables . ; it allows you enter things well . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_122	Oh , so it 's not very much . ; No , it 's not much at all . ; Seems like we should just change the transcripts ; Yeah .
Bro021_1183	uh ; well , we we obtain the means for each Gaussian and the variance . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is one .
Bed003_1417	It it might be useful here too . ; I I don't know how ; Mm - hmm . ; you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that .
Bmr010_1013	and I gave my my example , like I said , " microfon " in instead of " microphone " . ; Didn't bother ; I knew it when I said it . ; I remember s thinking " oh , that 's not correctly pronounced " .
Bmr014_888	I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1852	Yes , ; absolutely . ; Yeah . ; I think that would be excellent .
Bmr002_449	Right , this is the pilot data . ; And I w I wou I 'm assu I 'm assuming that I would not be uh you know e eh uh transcribing all of it . ; Yeah , yeah , you are generating it . ; Well , that that was part of the question ,
Bmr013_98	Um , it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . ; But , either way . ; Yeah . ; Yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this Aurora , uh data set .
Bmr013_28	OK . ; OK well , the , w uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . ; The digits goes up to about four thousand . ; Um , and so , uh , we probably will be done with the TI - digits in , um , another couple weeks . um , depending on how many we read each time .
Bro005_1007	Um . ; And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , ; I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , ; but one of the core quote " open questions " for that is um , um , if we take the uh you know , the best ones here ,
Bed003_1374	It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , ; so , um , ; because you say " OK , how can I get to the castle ? ; " Oh , how how much is it ? "
Bro018_1178	Yeah . ; Is that right ? ; Do you know which one it is ? ; It 's trained on a lot of different things .
Bed010_64	and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . ; And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the from the LISP . ; And so basically you just say , you know , " noun goes to " , you know , ; Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those .
Bro013_377	but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping
Bro019_776	What else is going on ? ; Mmm . ; You ; Yeah .
Bed003_453	I mean the ; ar ar are ; do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? ; Yeah , it does .
Bed015_1039	" Harry " and " room " , ; you know , the room ; th but they would be represented in this list somehow . ; And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot .
Bro003_1476	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; and the the second thing was about scratch space . ; And I think you sent an email about , um , e scratch space for for people to work on .
Bro005_405	Mm - hmm . ; And then I do the same ; but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta . ; And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta .
Bmr005_309	Um ; And the downsampling must have been Dan . ; Yeah . ; Good
Bro024_32	Why don't you go ahead , Dave ? ; OK . ; Um , ; so , yeah , the this past week I 've been main mainly occupied with , um , getting some results , u from the SRI system trained on this short Hub - five training set for the mean subtraction method .
Bro003_927	The s ; yeah , ; the Spanish , perhaps , ; Spanish .
Bro027_1027	But . ; What is the ; You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1589	so , um ; so u ; But ; i d I 'm sorry ,
Bmr008_1682	Yeah . ; It seems like with the overlaps being fairly long , that should make it easier . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_536	Fine . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the
Bmr003_497	and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that ; Great . ; unless of course they have funding issues ; Great .
Bmr005_1268	Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , ; um ; Right . ; and and and uh and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things .
Btr002_160	Right . ; It 's another case of devoicing at the initial ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bed012_678	We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess . ; Yeah . ; When 's Jerry leaving for Italia ? ; On on Friday .
Bns002_1453	but without really hard money in the background , it is very hard to come to the initial steps . ; And uh Juan Peire , one of the uh members of this NSA group has uh identified a certain kind of s start money , I would like to say . ; So maybe if you start with a small cluster of um the constraints of this funding , ; and that means uh six universities and and institutions
Bro013_768	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; and and people say it different ways .
Bmr028_1382	You know . So she certainly can define it . ; Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments . ; Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties , ; and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets .
Bro011_599	Mm - hmm . ; So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . ; So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word ,
Bed013_556	But that ; How many pages ? ; don't they need to finish the formalism ? ; It 's just like four pages .
Btr001_1030	Yeah . ; Oh , that 's interesting . ; You know , what 's On that sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is you can have a pronunciation of of the word " a " as " a " . ; Huh .
Bed011_45	So let me pop up a level . ; And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . ; So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . ; Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions .
Bro010_255	I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . ; Yeah , ; and that 's when you 'd start doing things . ; Yeah ,
Bro013_549	Yeah . ; Well , this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter , ; simply isn't ; Yeah .
Bro012_645	But on meeting digits , maybe there 's ; Maybe . ; Yeah . ; So it would be for the first deadline .
Bro003_112	I mean , just go down Martin Luther King . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_1003	I think with like some of them like you know with uh the difference between " the " and " the " , you can you can distinguished very , uh , u dif definitively like what context they 're gonna be used in . ; you know . ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_684	So I I wasn't there . ; They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . ; Big , big interest . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1577	I see . ; They 're pretty pretty specialized . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bdb001_457	Can you But you can add to those structures if you ; Sure . ; If you have more information . ; So what What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like " link start equals , um , you know , some node ID ,
Bmr006_1766	You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . ; One that 's public and one one that requires licensing . ; And so the licensed one would w we could it would be a sticky limitation . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_1613	Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well ; Mm - hmm . ; when you got gave it a lot more data . ; And then also they were saying , " Well , m You have access to a lot more data .
Bed005_853	Mm - hmm . ; What is the simspec mean , et cetera . ; M ; Right . Cuz for a while we were thinking , " well , how can we change the , um , data to sort of illicit tha illicit , um , actions that are more like what we are used to ? "
Bmr028_1537	That 's ; we weren't . ; That 's why we increased the error rate . ; Interesting .
Bmr002_480	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And otherwise , as part of a grant , you can you can do it . ; some sort of minimal wage .
Bmr015_1053	Yeah . If it gets ; Yeah ? ; Yeah i Right . ; If if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it ,
Bmr010_131	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I did some training on on one dialogue , which was transcribed by ; Yeah . We we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription .
Bmr002_1113	Yeah . ; We need to move forward from there . ; But uh , yeah , I guess it 's O K . ; And then , uh there 's also just the general question of will it handle multiple channels or should we just
Bro027_2067	But , no , this is good progress . ; So . ; Uh ; OK .
Bed013_94	Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's it 's not possible . ; Right , right . ; But maybe one could do some learning .
Bmr010_235	OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with , ; which is , um ; OK , and and also Da - Dave Gelbart . ; So there 's this this problem of
Bed014_388	Hmm ! ; I was really strong . ; Hmm ! ; Hmm .
Btr002_2566	And then there 's the other kind which sounds similar , ; but it 's really part of a laugh . ; So , " Hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm - hmm " . ; Hmm .
Bed014_971	And the s meeting recorder meeting meeting meeting recording on meeting meetings ; OK , OK , OK . OK . Yeah . ; So . ; Interesting .
Btr001_1743	Yeah , ; or when it 's a laugh . ; Yeah . ; I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd it would si say " breath " ,
Bns002_1059	You have a limited a limited header length . ; And maybe we will have to explain a little bit for those who are not familiar with source routing . ; So ; You can have the destinations you would like to or the in the I P addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know
Bro023_1150	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean , they they sound bad . ; But we 're not listening to it , usually .
Btr002_2127	Yeah ! ; Like I just , uh , I g ; yeah . ; I 'll I 'll do the same thing as you do ,
Bmr014_618	To ; No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the ; Hmm . ; Ah .
Bed015_956	So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . ; Yeah , ; OK . ; and , infer and I don't have I don't have a great way or great examples
Bmr019_1023	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr002_1242	I mean , it seems very strange . ; Mm - hmm . It is different . ; Well , it w it would it had the benefit of it ; So , this this was to handle the digits , uh , only ,
Bro027_91	Right . ; OK . ; Um ; OK .
Bmr018_321	Yeah , ; I am too . ; And I think it 's an empirical question . ; Can't we uh couldn't we just have , um ,
Bed005_1244	not because , you know , A is a Landmark or not , but we we we label this whatever object type , ; and if it 's a garden , it 's point three , point four , point two . ; If it 's a castle , it 's point eight , point one , point one . ; If it 's , uh , a town hall , it 's point two , point three , point five .
Bmr010_96	And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , ; w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , ; uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_1172	Yeah . ; OK , so i ; It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute ; and then I sorta get used to it .
Bed010_379	Hugin , ; yeah that 's free . ; How exp ; I don't think it 's
Bmr027_1473	Well , since last week . ; Yeah , we 're ; I mean , the the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um the automatic alignments ; because , uh , I got some
Bro023_902	I mean , the lowest you would get would be a zero , ; Right . ; cuz i if there was no other energy there you 're just subtracting exactly the noise . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bmr012_697	Great . ; Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will ; I didn't know that actually . ; Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,
Btr002_394	You know what I mean ? ; Like , where would you get the word " gruesome " ? ; I don't know . ; You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ?
Bro023_676	And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way . ; And , uh uh , spectral subtraction is is , uh uh , one approach to it . ; Do people use the Wiener filtering in combination with the spectral subtraction typically , ; or is i are they sort of competing techniques ?
Buw001_1451	Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_66	Yeah . ; Um . ; Was Hari on the on the phone ? ; Yeah , sure .
Bmr012_1216	Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other ; Pretty soon . ; Mmm , yeah . ; it just there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice
Bmr006_1815	Yeah . ; OK . ; I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . ; OK .
Buw001_206	Yeah . ; OK , so we were on the data collection and the summary issue . ; Right . ; We can go back .
Bed004_821	So all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . ; And that 's that would be the really pretty result . ; And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , ; i that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent
Bmr022_487	So if there are in the in the hundreds and thou or thousands of these ; Yeah . ; We have all that data . ; It must be in the high hundreds of them , at least .
Bmr022_1422	and we don't know what that is yet until we get feedback from people , ; but what if it 's OK to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the changes , ; and some people with permissions , maybe by request , to make changes , ; That we don't just give people permissions if they 're not gonna make changes .
Bmr010_1269	with the representations of parameter , ; Yes . ; because the the valleys and the peaks in the signal , eh , look like , eh , it doesn't follow to the to the energy in the signal . ; Right .
Bmr014_54	Yeah . ; and the other thing is that it could ; the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . ; It might be a connector .
Bro023_486	point ; Right . ; Yeah , ; so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six
Bmr016_1108	And , um , so , ; I did a bunch of checks , ; and the first thing I did was obviously a spell - check . ; And at that point I discovered certain things
Bed002_899	I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . ; All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_1023	I mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs ; uh um recognition runs , ; trying to figure things out about the features ; but it 's it 's all sort of in process ,
Bmr016_761	So that that 's it for the ; You 've compiled the list of , uh , speaker names ? ; Speakers and ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1082	and that 's probably the right way to do it . ; Yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings . ; Well , s ; Yep .
Bed014_243	Hmm ! ; Which ; This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? ; You know , and it 's cool , it works out that way .
Bns002_1547	Peire , P E I R E . ; P E I R E . ; You never heard from him ? ; No .
Bmr007_882	I I think it 's probably to work well eh , because , eh you have eh , in the mixed files a great level of energy . ; eh and great difference between the sp speaker . ; And probably is not so easy when you use the the PDA , eh that Because the signal is , eh the in the e energy level . ; Right .
Bmr007_375	I I agree that it 's an issue here but it 's also an issue for Switchboard ; and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which I think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,
Bed012_598	OK . ; Um , by the way , are Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy are coming ? ; So we can figure this out . ; Or ?
Bmr026_554	I think Dave Dave knows all these things , of course . ; Right . ; An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_111	Yeah . ; You don't move much during reading digits , I think . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1234	And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_584	but it was the full proposal - one . ; In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization ? ; Only LDA . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1216	These actions ; I don't know if I 'm gonna answer your question or not with this , ; but the categories inside of action schemas , ; so , SPG action is a category .
Bmr007_131	And , then if you look down in the summary table , then you see that , um th they 're differences in whether a person got overlapped with or overlapped by . ; Is this uh just raw counts or is it ; Raw counts . ; So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke .
Bed015_2017	Uh , ; But whatever . ; Uh , those are over rated . ; Yeah , no , no , no no .
Bmr016_1012	And middle . ; No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , ; Oh ; I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time .
Bmr030_786	You 're a data fiend . ; If we have the capability . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's like you build this room up for so long ,
Btr002_1602	Things that you ; I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time . ; When people get really loopy , ; and start telling lots of jokes , I think .
Bmr027_293	So . ; And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , ; Says that . ; Right .
Bmr026_283	It would be cool to see it ; It would be cool like to see to hear it and see it , ; And to hear it . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1595	Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool . ; and ; Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_183	You see how clumsy this is ; right ? ; I have to use these batteries to bias them . ; And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of There are like three connectors in the circuit .
Bro007_130	Uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay . ; Uh well ; Oh we can't do it . ; Oh OK .
Bmr011_355	who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . ; It 's sort of auditory related , largely for hearing aids and so on . ; But ; but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , uh , head models and microphone things .
Bmr028_1691	But you could ; Yep . Yep . ; So , you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting , in the sense that , you know , not everyone as you just said , you won't be there . ; And then if we find any problems , have the transcribers listen and
Bed006_1243	Right . ; So if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category . ; Then this category would we would put it ; or not necessarily
Bed006_635	because it was a problem for the German system to incorporate all these English movie titles . ; Yeah . ; Nuh ? ; Right .
Bro019_1593	Yeah . ; Mostly they do . ; Mmm , ; And and what I mean in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK
Bed009_316	But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space ; Mm - hmm . ; and the things that influence them . ; So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .
Bro003_625	w I th I think that 's a good idea ; Yeah , yeah . ; to to talk about the whole cube ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr014_1086	OK , ; It just sends me the time intervals . ; And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . ; I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data
Bed006_1492	Oh , uh ; People reach their level of uh max their level of at which they 're incompetent or whatever . ; Yeah . ; Maximum incompetence
Bro010_332	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I mean , you could do this with a recurrent net . ; And and then
Bmr014_113	That 'll help a lot , actually . ; Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . ; And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . ; But but But .
Bmr013_432	Some kind of low - level features , which are not , fully , you know , phone classification . ; And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone ; and and , you know . You could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth . ; But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing ,
Bro025_395	S ; Mm - hmm . ; The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the ; Uh - huh .
Bed010_185	And , ; so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . ; But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1768	But a little bit worse for well matched . ; So over all it gets , yeah , worse for the well matched condition , ; so y ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_336	The prosody ? ; and they uh ; OK . ; oh I see .
Bmr014_287	So anyway ; I I don't think it 'll take too long . ; So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect . ; So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .
Bmr006_1200	Yeah . ; But no , you 're absolutely right . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed010_982	Um , ; anyway , ; so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . ; We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not ,
Bed012_550	Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over . ; Yeah , but that 's that 's just shifting the problem . ; Then you would have to make a decision , ; " OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which decision nodes do I query ? "
Bro022_815	With some some gap . ; So ; I mean , with some pauses in the center , ; provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .
Bmr024_633	We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . ; or ? ; OK . ; OK .
Bro023_1681	I mean , disk ; but ; I think we 're OK . ; So .
Bro026_267	And finally frame dropping , which um , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . ; And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff .
Btr002_3270	Yeah . ; uh Th - this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you 're not gonna make a mistake . ; I tried to do it with the numbers ; and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems , so I stopped it .
Bmr007_991	You have candidates . ; the candidate . ; I ; to make marking easier .
Bed003_1266	That 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . ; Yeah , exactly . ; Right ? ; And this is just then just one .
Bro025_466	If the net 's on the server side then it could use all of the frames . ; Yes , it could be . ; It 's , like , you mean you just transferred everything ; and then finally drop the frames after the neural net .
Bmr014_794	Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . ; It depends on what meetings . ; That 's true . ; So far .
Bro004_731	and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not ; Uh , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff ; because we trained the networks ; If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task ,
Bed002_562	because where people ask you , " Where is New York ? " , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . Exactly . ; Right .
Bmr026_1	 ;  ; Yeah . ; OK , we 're on .
Bmr026_481	One point five or something . ; U Uh compressed how much are they ? ; Like ; Half a gig .
Bmr021_359	because I actually was running On a different experiment , ; I had segmented I was processing the whole Switchboard - two corpus , ; which is two hundred eighty hours of speech , ; and I was noticing , as I was almost finishing the processing , that I was running out of disk space .
Bmr008_1182	I think this one needs to be open - ended , ; completely open - ended , ; and the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field . ; Well , the there 's @ @ I mean .
Bmr003_2095	Right . ; Right . ; So . ; And so the you we just epoxy them down or something .
Bed002_708	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; From that task , yeah . ; So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room
Bsr001_997	Uh , it 's been going on for a while now . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , in many cultures it 's not bad manners to to speak on top of another one .
Bmr010_132	Mm - hmm . ; And I did some training on on one dialogue , which was transcribed by ; Yeah . We we did a nons s speech - nonspeech transcription . ; Jose .
Bmr006_1010	S ; So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . ; Yeah , because ; Yeah yeah .
Bmr006_1433	Interesting . ; I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_993	It 's fine . ; You know . ; Fine to do it however is convenient . ; Right .
Bns001_505	Routing ? ; So so we went through uh uh to through multicast . ; So this architecture with m ; well , at least no wireless environment or a mobile IP environment , comparable to uh UMTS environments . We really did not find any well , difficulties there .
Bmr018_1056	but the speech from the a actual other channels . ; Oh , oh , I see . ; Um , ; I don't think so .
Btr001_1871	But but it but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say , ; you know , i i you know , ; if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever , ; I remember from the very beginning , I would go to tea and start recognizing voices .
Bro023_970	If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction in that . ; Yeah , ; but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1279	Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two ; Uh , his a web page . ; You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . ; Subtract them .
Btr001_2716	Mmm . ; So , um ; Oh , can I ask also ? ; Sure .
Bmr009_1615	Yeah . ; Yeah . Let 's do digits , ; uh , and then we 'll turn off the mikes , and then I have one other thing to discuss . ; OK .
Buw001_167	Next one . ; Next nearest . ; Far . ; Furthest .
Bns001_491	OK . ; ist fertig . ; Uh . ; OK
Bmr010_1192	OK . ; So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot . ; Um . But , uh , ; you know , they both help each other .
Bsr001_210	so leave it on . ; Hmm . ; I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it . ; Maybe this is a little better .
Bro004_1054	um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . ; Maybe ; I don't know exactly how they are obtained . ; It 's on training .
Bmr002_483	some sort of minimal wage . ; Yeah . ; Well , we we need to We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan , ; Yeah .
Bro027_84	This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four . ; Oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the FFT ? ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bed005_1176	OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at . ; So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse ; uh , ; eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be .
Bro003_1158	Maybe one day . ; One day ? ; For HTK ? ; Yeah .
Bro022_127	Right ? ; Um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1574	You will send it , sorry . ; I will . ; Future . ; Sorry .
Bmr006_1706	Yeah . ; but then , again that kills your discourse analysis . ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_1106	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Good . ; For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired .
Bro028_648	And whether or not those are going to be tuned or not , ; and So . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , it makes a big difference .
Bmr008_578	Right yeah , they could say it different ways . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's more general .
Bed016_793	That ; but . ; Uh . ; Or , " having " is also , um , associated with location ,
Bmr024_851	Right . ; Um Yeah , ; I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , ; and and we can do that .
Bmr019_1264	Yeah . It 's it 's nice to know , ; Right . ; and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur . ; So I can have two foreground speakers ,
Bro018_719	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , if you 're interested y you could look , ; And
Bmr005_1465	because because because we would be asking them to do something different . ; Why why not ? ; Well , we can find out . ; I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in in LDC
Bed013_1245	wh what kinds of structure we want . ; OK , the next one would be here , just for mood . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1274	You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that . ; Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem . ; It 's ; No . But if you w just want to see what
Bmr012_1398	He 's in the he 's in the cour two two five D course . ; Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course , ; So , ; yeah .
Bro026_748	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , the SVM thing was an HMM also . ; It was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like
Bed006_510	Guaranteed , ; it 's just uh will I be here , you know , in ; uh ; I 'll be here too actually
Bro026_94	Yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a CVS server but then , yeah , you can access it . ; Oh , OK . ; So the anonymous mechanism ; you you can set up priorities .
Bed016_678	OK . ; There 's there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of , ; but , uh , ; this has gotten
Bro003_1936	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_735	Or we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep ; Encrypt it . ; You can hide it . Yeah . ; and then they could subtract the beep out .
Bro027_144	But , um ; Anyway , that was just something we wondered about . ; But , um , ; uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz .
Bed015_1956	then actually the next step is to start trying to do it . ; Exactly right . ; Got it . ; Mmm .
Bro012_1126	Yeah , my feeling is that um actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope ; and um it 's ; Right . ; No use of pitch uh basically .
Bed017_761	No , no . ; but uh or a temporarily putting it out of the sling ; Right . ; but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,
Bdb001_875	That 's the whole point . ; what you have to do is you have to basically ; Y yeah . You can use Perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice . ; But , the
Bmr026_394	Uh , Samosa . ; You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . ; Yeah , I had . ; Well it 's about I think there 's about twelve gig left .
Bmr005_1013	OK . ; I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know ; maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , ; but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .
Bmr003_1691	But . ; Right . ; Oh ! ; That is sort of f
Bed009_1002	Mmm , ah . ; It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning . ; But let me give you a very short version of this . ; So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .
Bmr019_1942	We ; Y Yeah , ; but ; Oh , and the groupings are important ,
Bmr006_1218	Yeah . ; and and and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . ; Yeah . ; It seems to me that that it 's not a p uh , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated .
Bmr026_40	We 're not waiting on them . ; We haven't done that process . ; So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process . ; Oh .
Bed004_669	So whenever there 's a choice , ; uh ; so like landmark - ness and usefulness , ; Well , see I don't think those would be mutually
Bro024_355	so in that situation , though , th maybe what 's a little different there , is I think you 're talking about there 's only one ; it it it also depends ; we 're getting a little off track here . ; Oh ,
Btr002_2390	Oh , how interesting . ; Yeah , just kind of , um ; And , uh that 's another thing like I I realize I do that too . ; I 'll ask you who this is later .
Bed003_670	And ; We would actually ; I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_428	Mmm . ; They 're going to give the endpoint information . ; I see . ; G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway ,
Bmr003_686	Right . ; There 's some interesting human factors problems like , yeah , what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly . ; Cuz then , you know , you get like if you get a span of five words , that 's easy . ; Yeah .
Bro004_295	So that 's TIMIT basically ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_142	if we just got two more of these ; I think that 's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately , and have them available . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr016_1296	Right , I just meant the middle two ones , ; Yep . ; yeah . ; Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to " laugh " , there 's another one
Bmr005_27	Oh sorry , go ahead . ; So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project . ; OK . ; It 's just uh
Bed011_567	Yeah , probably between stops back at the hotel . ; OK . ; Got it . ; I mean if you if if you wanted precise about it , uh you know ,
Bed012_902	Mm - hmm . ; Like " Bus dog fried egg . " I mean . ; You know . ; Or , if even something Chinese , for example .
Bmr023_847	That 's three point three . ; Um , actually , and it 's , ; um , ; What 's actually qu interesting is that with
Bed008_577	What ? ; Oh I d eh I don't know . ; Actually , I guess the easiest thing would move mo move the endpoint , ; well , go ahead .
Bmr023_758	Yeah . Sure . ; Yeah . ; Has has , uh ? We just I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the with the , uh uh , using the tandem system input for the ? ; Oh , yeah . I tried that .
Bro024_1423	Um , ; and for these s two system we have like fifty - five point , uh , five - percent improvement , ; and fifty - eight point one . ; So again , it 's around fifty - six , fifty - seven .
Bmr006_1224	I I Yeah . ; I don't I don't know ho ; I I I think ; Sorry .
Bmr014_1040	Yeah , uh no that it tha ; Tha - that 's true . ; That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around . ; that 's right .
Bmr009_1158	So let 's make it up . ; S I mean , who cares . ; Right ? ; We can make up our own
Bmr019_1847	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it 's background crunching . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_832	I 'm sorry , yeah . ; Not in Scotland . ; Well they don't speak such clear English ; They they sheep they s they they speak cheap English ,
Bed006_1687	So I don't think it will be isolated to one or the two , ; but you can definitely figure out where ; Yeah , sometimes things belong and ; So actually I 'm not sure
Bed003_1284	Mm - hmm . ; Precisely . ; So . ; One thing that 's kind of been bugging me when I more I look at this is that the
Bns001_337	It 's should be able to unplug a host , bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be . ; I 'm not sure i if it 's uh if you really have to con uh save a connection for all applications , ; I I don't think so . ; Yeah , but if this is the final goal ,
Bmr007_1135	Um in no particular order uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from from , uh three months ago . ; Uh XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to IBM . ; Um , pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription , ; uh next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM ,
Bed003_1383	so as in " No I really don't want to see that movie . ; I 'd rather stay home and watch TV " ; um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , ; Yeah , that 's what it 's called .
Bns002_1432	On the other hand , in the internet backbone , uh we it is i impossible ; and we see it on several examples ; like this , MPLS , ; there 's quality of service support , and multicast
Bed013_1375	And , additionally it might fit in really nicely with the paper . ; Um - hmm . ; Because if if if we want an example for the paper , I suggest there it is . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2640	Mm - hmm . ; I I agree , ; I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature . ; Where 's the little things that 's supposed to say " transcript L dash blah - blah - blah " ?
Btr001_1454	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either ; so it 's it 's audiotape . ; Oh wow .
Bns001_441	Now , I would like not to hear only three opinions . ; Hm ; But maybe there are also other opinions . ; OK .
Bro014_847	No . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bmr011_1705	Uh , Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . ; Remember @ @ ? ; Pre - processing . ; Well I think that that was just sort of
Bed015_2041	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and inheritance is only one I mean , that 's one way to organize it ; but there are others . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1483	In principle what I I think that this approach does , ; and e e whether or not we take the Enter - View and we all throw up up the ladder ; um wha how do how does Professor Peter call that ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1196	Yeah . ; Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " , ; um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . ; So he has very little manpower .
Bmr015_548	And when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming . ; I I would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names . ; So , I mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , ; Right .
Bns003_592	I don't think so . ; So you are looking for a job . ; That 's probably then OK . ; in principle , I would like to say you are lost for the NSA group ,
Bed017_175	and that makes a ; I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . ; And so , ; I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net ,
Bed006_1424	And you could have also indicated that by saying " Enter , what are the kinds of action I am ? " ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; Right .
Bmr006_642	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . ; Um , someone deleted something somewhere . ; And so we have some room again .
Bed009_760	None of them are suitable ? ; I I I d I 'm asking . ; I don't know . ; Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast
Bro021_537	Right . ; Cool . ; Yeah . ; Great .
Bmr027_1237	The disk space was short . ; Yeah , we know disk space is short . ; Yeah . That 's what I thought too . ; That 's a great ambiguity .
Bmr019_531	You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker . ; To be best ; For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1031	I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient . ; Wh ; Right . ; You just run a program to restore them .
Bro028_858	And that 's ; I just went through the poster quickly , ; Yeah . ; And I don't remember whether it was filter bank things
Bmr016_1914	Well , that 'd qualify . ; On the glosses for numbers , ; Yeah . ; it seems like there are lots of different ways it 's being done .
Bmr007_848	Hmm . ; Does an do you remember , Morgan , ; was it Broadcast News ? ; I think so , yeah .
Bro019_1332	Cumulants or something . ; Uh , I don't know . ; But No . ; I don't remember .
Bmr003_1550	Um ; But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK . ; I see . ; So th
Bmr014_984	Uh - huh . ; If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password " , ; seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . ; And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .
Bmr006_1687	Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh , @ @ uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . ; So , people are really flexible .
Bro005_1020	And then um then see , again , how ; We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than , uh we 're gonna test on , ; but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_321	No . ; Yeah . OK . ; Uh For Italian , yeah . ; For this case , right ?
Btr002_761	I think you could , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , yeah . ; I think so too .
Bns002_229	So , uh , any transmission has a maximum transmission range , ; and uh in the simpler way , we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius . ; OK ? ; The value of this radius is uh in principle , is a fixed value
Bro019_1589	I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well . ; How did ; But ; But but mostly they are .
Bmr027_285	We did that , I I believe . ; Right . ; So . A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_893	Oh OK . ; that 's how I know that . ; That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1129	I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from ; Mm - hmm . ; What about uh hidden unit size on this . ; Oh , wait a minute ,
Btr001_594	And f ; Yeah . ; And you had to mark interruptions by a slash , ; Mm - hmm ,
Bro028_1206	We do the digits and then we get our treats . ; Oops . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed014_488	Should we have a a a ; or or whether the construction semantically , uh , is clearly only asking for location ; Uh ; but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning " tell me how to get there " .
Bmr009_738	Yes . ; Yeah . ; Good . Good . ; I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News .
Bmr020_1660	And we can just , you know , get the meeting , ; process it , ; put the beeps file , ; send it off to IBM .
Bmr006_201	Right . ; because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards . ; Well ; Oh .
Bmr024_48	And then if ti if there 's time I wanted to talk about digits , ; but it looked like we were pretty full , so I can wait till next week . ; Right . ; OK .
Bsr001_2430	Well , you could have TI you know , " she put her dirty laundry in the clean clean bathwater " , whatever . ; but . ; Yeah , ; that 's right ,
Btr001_1893	Nice guy . ; Nice guy . ; so I kept wanting to meet him . ; And then John told me that he 's not around anymore .
Bed011_315	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; That was the first subject . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1722	Which is which is certainly giving a ; So you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . ; to ; Yeah . So it it 's an additional discriminating information .
Bmr025_603	Oh ; Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup ; and he pretty much said " yeah , you could do that if you want " ; but he thought it was a bad idea .
Bmr021_43	So , um , we should probably get different mikes . ; So the question is , the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more , um , Sony mikes . ; Just two more of those , ; um . And that that 's easy
Bmr020_966	I thought that was ; So if you were to use these , you have to be careful not to pull out these individual ; Yeah . ; Oh !
Bed008_252	Yeah , OK . ; Did I or didn't I ? ; Ah . Probably nothing done yet , ; oh I just did it on the upper ones , OK .
Btr001_1014	Yeah , I 'm sure it 's ; Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation , ; Oh , really ? ; and it 's predictable apparently ,
Bmr019_379	You 're all watching . ; This is terrible . ; It 's just we we think it has some spikes . ; So , uh , we we didn't use that one .
Bed017_414	which is more elaborate than " I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . " ; So . ; And I think that I don't need to tell you this . ; I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context
Bro023_524	I 'm I 'm confused about that . ; Um , ; so , it 's like ; So it 's the close - talking microphone .
Bed010_165	Right . ; OK . ; So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us ; we just need to really understand what 's there .
Bmr006_188	if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in um , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . ; I guess I maybe ; Hmm . ; Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have
Bed013_107	See the the generation bit , making the system generate generate something , is shouldn't be too hard . ; Well , once the system understands things . ; Yeah . No problem . ; I just don't think I think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things .
Bro021_981	Yeah . Cuz it doesn't just follow what 's there . ; Uh - huh . ; Y yeah . If if you take log X into log one plus N by X , and then expand the log one plus N by X into Taylor series ; It has to be some , uh , Taylor series
Bmr031_608	Maybe a compu maybe ; Well , if not if you want to burn the C Ds , you 're welcome to it . ; I say we give it to LDC and let them do it . ; Well , yeah .
Bmr014_1026	Yeah that 's true . ; of and ; " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . " ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1333	Y right . ; Their their legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise . ; right . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_575	Yeah . ; So . So ; Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere ; but we can't necessarily I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software
Bmr010_706	And they said , uh , the breathing is really a a terrible problem for them , ; to to not recognize breathing as speech . ; Wow . ; So , anything to reduce breathing is is is a good thing .
Bed012_797	Yeah , but , uh , we have no discourse input . ; Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh ; Yeah . ; Sure .
Btr002_3124	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; B but y t finish your point .
Bmr003_749	Yeah , ; so so what what she 's done so far , is sort of more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases , continuous phrases . ; Yeah . ; And so , um , that 's nice because you you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end .
Bro008_73	but I mean , it sounds like , uh , one way or another , the methods that we 're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel ceptrum down by , you know a fourth of them to , uh , a half of them . ; Somewhere in there , depending on the exact case . ; So ; So that 's good .
Bmr018_1431	I I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference , ; Was were there folks from BBN presenting ? ; but ; yet there was , let 's see , this was on the last day , Mitre , BBN , and , um , Prager
Bro021_1013	Yeah . ; And then we can , ; uh , ; you know
Buw001_1460	OK . ; Yeah , that 's like ; n ; I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then .
Bed014_1081	Yeah , sort of through the weekend ; because Kate has a photography show . ; That 's fine . So we might continue our email thing ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1255	No . ; Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this ; Shall we do digits ? ; Oh yeah .
Bro014_1014	I think it 's a neat thing . ; it seems l you know ; Uh , it seems like a good idea . ; Yeah .
Bed003_672	I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; but I 'd like to see more .
Bmr009_1290	But then it says " Region " , ; but Region actually just applies to uh , US , ; right ? ; Right .
Bro018_845	But ; Yeah , ; and I think , hhh I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run sort of the reverse experiment . ; Uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did
Bmr007_783	Of course , the where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to cong to gravitate to the same place each time . ; Yeah . ; and it 's somewhat coincidental . ; I 'm sitting here so that I can run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something .
Bro028_773	and I I 'm not sure . ; But , um ; OK . ; It 's some kind of a mixture of Gaussians and , uh , clustering
Bmr016_1258	So a are we done with acronyms ? ; Cuz I had a question on what what this meant . ; I 'm still doing the overview . ; I haven't actually gotten here yet .
Bmr001_187	The thing is , like , it 's it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop . ; So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one . ; um And I 'm still not sure . ; I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this .
Bro004_799	and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . ; Oh no , ; but it would still be even more of a binary decision . ; It it 'd be even more of one .
Bed002_1076	No , th It turns out that there is a , uh The new end of Java libraries . ; OK , and it turns out one called ; Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_458	Right ? ; Because and then the the the the thing is served . ; So you just make it , you know , " oh , you won ; you know , go to this web site
Bmr018_1242	Ah . ; so it doesn't slide up . ; So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance . ; Yep , right right below
Bro023_986	Yeah . ; Well , there are different things that you can do . ; Oh . ; People can also , uh , reflect it back up and essentially do a full wave rectification instead of a instead of half wave .
Bro004_1206	They they clearly did actually remove silent sections ; in order because they got these word error rate results . ; So um I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this ; because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result
Bro018_882	so i I I don't know if that it probably doesn't mess it up , ; it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already in the right format or something ; but the the the two processes that happen are a little different . ; So .
Bmr022_1380	Good point . ; Yeah . ; Now But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1227	and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ? ; I I thought of some extra a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention . ; OK . ; One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far .
Bro003_1881	but what they did is to training , uh , English nets with all the phonemes , ; and then training it in English nets with , uh , kind of seventeen , I think it was seventeen , uh , broad classes . ; Automatically derived ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_662	Couldn't format them . ; and ; No . ; I didn't hear anything after that .
Bmr029_786	Because you already did did y didn't you already do that experiment ? ; I I I got confused , ; cuz I thought I thought you were using the whole Macrophone set . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_141	and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . ; So that if you have very long utterances you have the best , ; Yeah . ; but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .
Bro003_399	Yeah . ; Yeah , perhaps . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_654	we still have to work on Finnish , ; um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . ; For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . ; So . Now we can test these two networks on with with delta and large networks .
Btr001_2274	S sort of . ; I 'd definitely like to look more at that if I can , ; but . ; That 's cool .
Bed012_206	Say , if we had to y deal with arbitrary language , it wouldn't make any sense to do that , ; Mm - hmm . ; because there 'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_511	Yeah . ; So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones ; yeah . ; Very possible .
Bsr001_1192	And ; So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume , you should be able to figure out it 's a backchannel and things like that . ; Anyway , ; apparently , and you guys know more than I do , there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this so that Mari 's group
Bmr018_1646	I mean , you so there 's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah - blah - blah , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; and then there 's people saying , " Oh , just add more data . "
Bed002_524	Um , ; because um , sometimes people just say things ; This you find very often . ; " Where is the city hall ? "
Buw001_2270	Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , I think ; Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot .
Bmr013_880	Um , and also I 'll be , um , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . ; And eh to incorporate , uh , keyword , at the beginning . ; So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . ; Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format .
Btr001_715	It doesn't hurt to have a pad . ; It 's it 's nicer to have a pad than not , ; Yeah . ; Then to have it be cut off .
Bed002_950	Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? ; Like , do the ; It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to ; Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was .
Bro018_20	OK . ; And I 'm trying two MLP , one one that only have t three output , ; voice , unvoice , and silence , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1339	or " Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed . ; And , like , well , I don't you know , it was like " hope , wish . desire " , ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr015_521	Just so that they 're they 're all the same length . ; But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always ; as long as you have ; uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string .
Bmr007_532	There you go . ; Yeah . ; Thank you . ; E for example .
Bmr019_396	It it like this . ; and then you have to scr ; I I already adjusted this a number of times . ; Eh .
Bmr013_832	And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Alright .
Btr002_1252	I did it a little . ; Did you do it ? ; I thought so . ; Good , good .
Btr001_1847	from having listened to all these people , ; I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances .
Bro027_779	Um , ; Yeah . ; So actually , this is in between what we had with the previous VAD and what Sunil did with an IDL VAD . ; Which gave sixty - two percent improvement , right ?
Bmr031_387	Are they doing some nice integer multiple of th of sixteen ? ; No . ; Are they they 're doing , like , twenty - two ; No . No , no , it was like forty something .
Bed008_786	Uh ; So let me suggest we switch to another one , ; I mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_351	OK . ; Talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_774	But , you know , it didn't change th the ; by adjusting that the , um ; OK . ; Yeah . The error changed by probably one percent or so .
Btr002_2684	That 's right . ; Right . ; Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them and say that they 're laughing . ; Hmm .
Bed016_1078	There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions ; I don't like uh ; " I 'm out of sorts now ! " ; Right .
Bmr003_1383	And , um . ; And so , ; uh , that 's a nice feature . ; And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit .
Bmr029_308	So each meeting each meetings takes , uh , something like ; Again , we we I ran when we ran these , we were sort of short on machines , ; and , um , ; I don't know ,
Bro005_1078	They 're doing LDA RASTA , ; Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to just to get the VAD labels and the final features . ; yeah ? ; So they will send us the Well , provide us with the feature files ,
Bro005_407	but with the delta and delta - delta PLP delta and delta - delta . ; And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta .
Bed003_1134	Yeah . ; Right . ; But if th if there is an XML file that or format that it can also read ; I mean it just reads this ,
Bro005_655	um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . ; For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . ; So . Now we can test these two networks on with with delta and large networks . ; Well , test them also on Finnish
Bed008_1060	Mm - hmm . ; and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , ; so what 's going to happen is that eventually ; Alright .
Bdb001_415	Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech , ; and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say " it 's an utterance " , as opposed to the tag to say " it 's a link " . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro024_183	You know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , ; and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . ; So ; I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech
Bmr013_674	Oh , shoot ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The pre presegment
Bmr012_1066	so it 's this ; Mmm . ; So so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ? ; Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .
Bro003_1736	Uh , ; uh . ; What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . ; Right ?
Bro015_99	I stopped it . ; Ah . You stopped working on it ; Interfered . ; I see
Bmr024_1185	Yes , I 'm using tandem features . ; Oh you are ? ; A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features . ; Cool .
Bro025_572	Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , um , ; eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And , um , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty
Bro016_308	I mean , Andreas gave a very reasonable response , ; and he 's probably not gonna be the only one who 's gonna say this in the future ; of , you know , ; people people within this tight - knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting , uh , more or less , that these are the rules .
Bmr020_1482	because I thought that was gonna be the most prevalent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But if we send them without editing , then we 're also gonna hafta have m uh , notations for words that are cut off , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_601	Yeah . ; Right . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bmr027_993	so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . ; And , um , then once , uh , ; th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings ; and they can grab those , too , with SCP .
Bmr028_597	Yeah . But but y there 's there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second . ; Yeah . ; Really ? ; I wouldn't think that the language model would continue across two seconds .
Bmr019_605	So what what do we do now ? ; Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to eh , ; and we 've talked about this in other contexts ; we want to have the ability to feed it different features .
Bro023_33	Yeah . ; No , he 'll be around for three weeks . ; He 's , uh , um , very , very , easygoing , ; easy to talk to ,
Bns003_770	OK . ; Thank you . ; Claudia , I still mentioned , Have you other things ? ; For me , as I said before I will be funded by a d uh by the ministry of , uh , the German government for research in the project so - called Invinet
Buw001_1186	OK , five - thirty . ; I don't ; Is that OK ? ; We 'll probably hit horrible traffic .
Bmr008_330	It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes . ; Yeah . ; I mean a lot of corpora ; Uh , sure . But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me
Bro004_1230	it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . ; When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ? ; Well , see they , ; I I think they 're
Bed011_298	And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references . ; Well , so Keith , what do you think ? ; Well , um it seems that ; Yeah , I mean ,
Bed017_283	I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , ; Mmm . ; uh , structural uncertainty . ; It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM
Bmr021_471	XF . ; No , you the ones that You the ones that you put them on when you put them on XE . ; Oh , different ones ? ; I don't remember where I put them now .
Bsr001_1518	mm - hmm . ; cuz I think we might wanna go with that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1460	People always say very glibly that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything , ; cuz it may not be show uh , because , you know , it doesn't tell you anything about the good system . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I 've always sort of felt that that depends .
Bed015_370	So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations , ; Mm - hmm . ; those could intersect with these ; in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions .
Bro012_1093	Mm - hmm . ; So . Uh . ; So if they have a better one , we should use it . ; I mean .
Bro016_660	Mm - hmm . ; So , if you had a first formant that was one hundred hertz before , if the fifty if the vocal tract is fifty percent shorter , then it would be out at seven fifty hertz , ; and so on . ; So , that 's a move of two hundred fifty hertz .
Bmr006_79	Yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . ; So So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_546	so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface ; and , uh , ; Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ? ; Right .
Bmr029_771	Sorry . ; Um . Can you repeat the question ? ; Uh , whe when you trained on Macrophone , um , to do those digits experiments , did you use the entire Macrophone corpus ? ; There wa it is a subse
Bed003_1455	Is that possible ? ; One time I saw a report on trains , ; and I think there is a l ; I don't know if
Bro003_734	Yeah . ; and everything else the same . ; Compare that with just M - MFCC without the the net . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_269	And she 's right , that a that having a having having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth , it 's it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the the same kind of picture you have here . ; But ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bed002_215	It 's really simple though . ; So this is the idea . ; Um . ; We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , I think we we will agree on that , um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype ,
Bns001_1646	or they are on layer f one to l l up to layer four . ; Bu ; And the service people are considering ; " OK , UMTS
Bmr016_1757	Yeah . ; What did I say ? ; Language , uh ; To the language model model .
Bed016_684	Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today . ; What ? ; Not not your marks . ; Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there .
Bsr001_2491	Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too . ; We could do some digits . ; Well I I don't have any of the print outs . ; OK .
Bmr009_359	The the the But Consider ; but just simple case ; and the one that has the lot of data associated with it . ; Right .
Bro021_870	Y of the spectrum ; Uh , this this is this ; or ? ; and this is this .
Bed016_669	Yeah . ; oh yeah , mo for sure , ; motivated , ; but then you can't parse on motivated .
Bmr003_2271	So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up ; See ; so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . ; I agree .
Bsr001_2074	So " gonna " versus " going to " and that kind of thing . ; Right . ; I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1200	U ; yeah , yeah . ; So , you don't need da data enough to cover uh , nearly as much stuff . ; I mean
Bmr001_278	Hopefully . ; Oh , you mean for location ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns001_1685	but for me , you have not the end to end parts of for for IP functionality . ; We are far away from that . ; And if you take a really look to the GPRS protocols texts and I believe also they apply for UMTS but I 'm not ; eh very familiar with that ,
Bmr009_815	Well , how would the How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ? ; It 's an interesting observation , ; but it was intentional . ; Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and ,
Bro023_1102	Yeah . ; plus , uh , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well . ; s ; They have like
Bmr027_770	The speech recognizer still works . ; Yeah . And if you do it backward then ; Yeah . ; That 's cuz they use forward - backward .
Bns001_1340	N ; Well , I 'm not sure . ; I I th I think I agree with him . ; But uh right now we 're looking at b a th You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing .
Buw001_688	Huge . ; I mean , it personally , I don't I would never want to deal with it . ; But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1333	uh But it won't be installed for a little while . ; U Go ahead . ; Do we Do we have that big new IBM machine ; the , I think in th
Bed003_341	There were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , ; but you know , we didn't have ; Mm - hmm . ; That was like our example .
Bed009_623	OK . ; OK so that 's interesting . ; Yes I was just that 's my next question ; hmm
Bed013_247	Oh ! We calculated a different number before . ; How did we do that ? ; Hmm . ; I remember there being some other one floating around .
Bmr008_475	I I I 'm sorry , so you 're saying ; but ; Mm - hmm . ; uh I I I just missed something , though .
Bmr007_60	What about the , um your trip , yesterday ? ; Um . ; Sort of off - topic I guess . ; Cuz that 's Cuz that was all all about the , uh
Bmr023_1097	OK . ; I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated ; from the original PLP , ; Right .
Bdb001_1347	And that 's about all you can do . ; And beyond that , all you know is is relative ordering ; and sometimes even that is wrong . ; So so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences ,
Bmr012_1273	but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , ; you know it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that ; and they have various observations that would be fun , I think . ; That 's a great idea .
Bed017_697	Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , ; OK ? ; And then we 'll go . ; So , I it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil .
Bmr031_1395	Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . ; Right . ; But I mean , that th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that . ; Right .
Bmr008_721	So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes . ; Mm - hmm . ; and we 're ; and then we like I said , we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people .
Bro021_911	X times one plus , uh , N uh , N N N minus X ? ; The ; Yeah . ; And then ,
Bro018_723	OK . OK . ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; I can I can show you I
Bro003_1880	I think they 've not done it , uh , doing , uh , multiple language yet , ; but what they did is to training , uh , English nets with all the phonemes , ; and then training it in English nets with , uh , kind of seventeen , I think it was seventeen , uh , broad classes . ; Automatically derived
Bmr026_505	Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap . ; I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , ; Right . ; Yep .
Bro026_587	Is that how they do it ? ; OK . ; OK . ; Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the
Bro005_310	So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to to ninety , or something . ; So ; Well , ninety ; No , I I mean ninety
Bsr001_565	Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these , ; If you 're not used ; I can't ; so I 'm used to this .
Bro010_690	Mmm . ; where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing ; and other things where it 's not so stationary ; Yeah .
Bmr006_94	So . ; OK . ; But maybe that 's enough . ; So , in general , I was thinking more data
Bns001_122	So this kind of things I think I 'm more or less well - trained . ; So ; this is , I think , um , my first presentation . ; Next maybe next meeting I will uh , do a small sketch about uh , my past work , and well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks , so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing .
Buw001_1249	Yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah . ; Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . ; Hey .
Bmr005_1254	And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . ; And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh ; Right . ; Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .
Bed014_254	Where the " where is " construction is . ; OK . ; Where is X ? ; What what thing is this ?
Bmr023_282	Including IBM 's . ; Well , I don't know . ; The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks . ; OK .
Bmr010_436	cuz in in in ; They seem to want to get absolutely clear on standards for transcription standards and so forth with with us . ; Oh ! This was from before December . ; Right . Because they 're they 're presumably going to start recording next month .
Buw001_2094	Yeah . ; I mean , the ; Yeah . ; Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field ,
Bro022_65	Yeah . ; Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . ; Oh . ; Soon .
Bmr027_259	OK . ; OK ? ; I ha I have one question . ; This is in the summer period
Bed002_745	And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; If they 're doing it in a ; you know , " I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions " ,
Bro024_825	So . ; We probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system - two kind of stuff with this , with the spectral subtraction for that reason . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_518	Things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible . ; IE a a castle ; or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_141	But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . ; Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . ; The back - end stuff is working out fine . ; It 's more or less ready to go .
Btr002_2305	Mm - hmm . ; I don't erase the " um " 's and " uh " 's , ; I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , ; and " And they 're
Bmr029_256	So we need to have results for all three of those , ; even though we have ; Ma - maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder meetings ? ; OK .
Bed003_348	So there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues ; From the discourse that ; Yeah . ; for one of those .
Bmr021_993	or th they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the " on " position or whatever . ; I don't know , ; uh eh . Fff . ; What would you like it to do when that happens ?
Bns002_1422	So I suggest we go roughly to the slides here ; and um ; The the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes . ; And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um Wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible .
Bed006_312	That 's ; OK . ; And he also approached me and he offered to help um our project ; and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks
Bmr021_190	No . ; Student discount . ; Yeah , good mikes are expensive . ; And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure ,
Buw001_26	Yeah , with the We kno I know . ; " Sip , sigh . " ; I was just noticing a big s ; We know exactly how much you have left in your cup .
Bmr026_166	Oh well . ; Um ; And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , ; and I don't know how much more we can do with it
Bns002_1137	I mean , would the option for me to to use less power when sending a packet is to send it to the closest neighbor . ; OK , assuming that I 'm I 'm also using s or having some kind of power control thing . ; so that way transmitting to the closer close to my closer node , is , uh something that requires less effort than sending to a more distant node . ; Maybe the closer node is not a good uh it is not in the good direction to the to reach the destination .
Buw001_289	And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval ; even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . ; Right . ; I 'm gonna do something .
Bmr005_1274	you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . ; And that 's and especially with the student ; Right . ; uh for instance this guy who seems
Bro024_1296	Uh , ; uh , from zero to two two thousand hertz . ; So maybe just looking at this frequency range for from five hundred to two thousand would improve somewhat the VAD ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1917	the other side is , yeah . ; Uh , right . ; No one wants to do that . ; Yeah .
Bed005_923	OK ? ; And then there 's a language generator , ; and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer . ; Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to English .
Bro016_167	or if it 's in the log domain , divide it by seven . ; Mm - hmm . ; But ; but ,
Bmr018_614	Yeah . ; OK . ; Those were the non - natives . ; And then there was another distinct bump at , like , a hundred , which must have been some problem .
Bed006_566	Mm - hmm . ; If and they 're kind of correct . ; So it 's not done basically . ; Hmm ?
Bmr027_211	Yeah . ; If someone says " hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ? ; We have to remove it . ; Well . That 's true .
Bed011_46	And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . ; So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . ; Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . ; And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules .
Bmr006_612	before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet . ; I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . ; And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . ; And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .
Bed011_945	you know , um , " Caused motion " , ; I don't know , ; something like that . ; OK .
Bmr008_320	So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other . ; OK ? ; OK . ; um and then I put " Optional " with a big " Optional " in parentheses , Age .
Bmr014_276	Yeah . ; Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that . ; Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . ; So I did the all that last week .
Bmr016_1369	so she didn't know . ; We just we 're waiting on that just to do the alignments . ; Yeah . ; Yeah I 'm curious to se hear what it is ,
Bed017_317	profiled , ; focused , again . ; Designated ? ; Of course .
Bro011_442	and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there , ; but I I 'm not sure ; Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? ; Guess you could , yeah .
Bns001_1277	impossible to change . ; You see the difficulties with IP version six , ; eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast . ; They are discussed since , you know , ten years or whatever .
Bmr028_1331	like the words that are actually there . ; All we mean by that is that we 're giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw , ; over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed . ; OK . I mean , that that part is OK .
Bro013_203	And here you had , you know , something like three point four . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_328	They weren't looking ahead much . ; They p they looked ahead a little bit . ; A little bit . ; OK .
Bmr026_701	Yeah ; and ; I think it must be uh nearing the end of the week . ; Um . Yeah .
Bmr021_135	Isn't that something . ; OK . ; And so we had these wired for us . ; Oh . I see . OK .
Bmr030_261	and so , normally if you look at an F - naught track , it jumps all over the place . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; This is a nice smooth one
Bmr011_1014	Hmm . ; We 'll see . ; I mean , I think , th you know , they they they 've proceeded along a bit . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , uh , you know , have some more discussions with them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_35	it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ? ; Right . ; Was that sort of the division ? ; So which week are we in ?
Bed015_939	So , the question is actually ; And it would ; oh , I 'm sorry , ; yeah ,
Bmr002_526	So ; Yeah . ; Well , whatever they people who have had to do this ; I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um I mean there 's than than what 's been done in the past
Bro012_1068	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use . ; Uh . If the use the small VAD
Bmr006_183	The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , ; Uh - huh . ; but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_162	Yeah . ; So you just need to copy over to this one . ; OK . ; Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems .
Btr001_838	and then it became a word together from what was before and after ; and then with this little tiny millisecond pause . ; So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe , there 's pauses somehow , ; I guess
Bmr006_26	So uh so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . ; And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . ; It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , ; but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less .
Buw001_175	OK . ; Thanks . ; Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , ; and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow .
Bro008_113	Do we know anything about ; who who 's was it that had the lowest on the dev set ? ; Um , uh , the , uh , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of of , uh , French Telecom and Alcatel . ; And , um they they differed in some respects ,
Bed013_910	OK . Just t ; Cool . ; Mmm . So . ; Cuz things fit onto that , see ?
Bns003_170	But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested . ; Um ; and the alumni page , in principle , we have to , ; you know , but it 's primarily my job , I believe , uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis
Bed016_881	So I would try to I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; You know , it 's an obvious one
Bmr016_25	so I I just have to go through them ; Well , OK . ; and uh pick out the ones that have problems , ; and either correct them or have them re - read .
Bro016_112	Looking at the I wrote down what the deletions , substitutions , and insertions were , ; uh , ; for different numbers of states per phone . ; Yeah .
Bro010_697	Hmm . ; uh , ; but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . ; I think that it 's uh
Btr002_1697	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things , like , " Well , the transcribers " ; so , " Rer - rer - rer - rer "
Bmr024_1063	So once it 's on tape ; Right . ; And the only thing that costs is the back - up issue , eh , to first order . ; Right .
Bmr003_2577	Yeah , ; I have to do ; that 's true ; but we haven't spent that , right ?
Bro004_333	Yeah . ; So . This was for the PLP , ; Yeah . ; Um . The
Buw001_1085	Right . ; just ; So I have a question about queries , ; God , that 's bugging me .
Bed013_523	And . It just never hurts . ; And Keith and - or Johno will go , probably . ; Will I ? ; When is it and where ?
Bns002_393	This is node two ; and this is the source , ; Yeah . ; and this is node three that is the final destination .
Btr002_2409	But it 's not lexicalized . ; This is not a ; Hmm . ; That 's kind of the impression I got too .
Bed014_184	Festival ? ; It 's the name of some program , ; the the synthesizer . ; Oh , oh . Got it . OK .
Bro021_556	I got intelligible speech back . ; But they still weren't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means . ; And also I 've been talking to , um , Andreas and Thilo about the , um , SmartKom language model ; and about coming up with a good model for , um , far mike use of the SmartKom system .
Bro010_407	Mm - hmm . ; Maybe . ; Could be . ; Good good to know .
Buw001_964	Do it on pilots or laptops or something . ; OK , if something 's important everyone clap . ; OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens . ; OK .
Bro010_427	We we was thinking to do before after VAD ; or ; Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . ; Yeah ,
Bmr008_1632	So I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough that there 's some voicing in each of them , by each of the speakers , then you should do very well if you do this . ; Right . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr001_2052	Yeah . ; What would be the point of that ? ; Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback . ; Oh .
Bmr027_400	you know , a little bit earlier than ; Well ; It 's much easier to explain this way . ; OK . Well , why don't you talk t
Bro019_1341	And I 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or ; yeah . ; maybe higher - order cumulants ; Oh .
Bmr019_969	Is that what you 're talking about ? ; Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was ? ; That was fixed , um , before ; i i i I think I I think I understood that pretty
Bro004_256	" yes , ; there is a reduction in performance , when you don't um have the s when you don't have um ; Task data . ; Wait a minute ,
Bed014_378	And that by the way is is , Keith , what I encouraged George to be talking with you about . ; Not the formalism yet ; Mm - hmm . ; but the phenomena .
Bed003_1830	OK . ; Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue . ; OK . ; Switching o
Bro028_116	Yeah . Yeah . ; Right ? ; OK . ; Mmm .
Btr001_495	In German , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; There were problems even with , um , Am - English speakers though .
Bro023_374	So that 's like the word error rate is like four point three . ; Four point three . ; Like Ten point seven . ; What 's ten point seven ?
Btr002_2119	I do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'll end utterances with " so " or " and " . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1557	No . I I hadn't in intended to . ; but ; There 's no way . ; OK .
Bmr001_283	Depends on who 's working on it . ; Yeah , right . ; but someone has to write some software to to actually do it . ; Right .
Bmr015_856	Is height . ; Yeah . ; This this is the idea the idea I I I had ; to to compare the the ratio of the the energy of the harmonics with the eh , with the , eh , total energy in the spectrum
Bmr006_1225	I don't I don't know ho ; I I I think ; Sorry . ; I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near .
Bed004_630	There 's just too many factors right now . ; too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially . ; Right . ; So we wanna think about which ones we really care about
Bro024_241	Anyway . ; o OK . ; So , um , ; a actually I was just thinking about what I was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the SmartKom system to do the mean subtraction .
Bmr027_623	Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email . ; Yeah . ; So far , two people have . ; Yeah . I think very few people will
Bro014_114	and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much . ; So you you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a ; So I ; Uh , I I have to look to see what the exact numbers were .
Bsr001_2452	Uh ; That 's right , ; this we could each make up a string . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2499	You know , there 's like , you know , that , ; Right . ; and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like ; I don't know , like , um Hhh .
Bmr009_331	Mm - hmm . ; The m the right model will be easier to see that way . ; So if I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech ; Yeah .
Bmr002_264	and the voice . ; Just no way . ; Well , don't you ; I I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms in .
Bro012_819	I mean ; So it ; y Yeah . ; You you get an estimate of the standard deviation .
Bmr018_822	To to know what an overlap really if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just a a a segment correlated with an overlap , ; Ah , OK . ; Yeah . ; and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper .
Bdb001_356	I mean ; They generate their own . ; Actually , I I just you know , we we 've done this stuff on prosodics ; Yeah .
Bro019_1355	Uh . ; So it was on PLP derived cepstral coefficients . ; Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does . ; Mmm .
Btr002_1687	Really ? ; Oh , it 's so funny . ; No ! ; Oh , Johno does a lot of that .
Bro003_860	Spanish from Spain . ; Yeah , OK . ; From Spain . ; Alright .
Bed015_1591	Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces ; because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , i
Bed010_815	Anyway yeah , so we 'll we 'll look at this . ; And . So , all of these issues now are now starting to come up . ; So , now we 're now done with demos . ; We 're starting to do science ,
Bed006_700	But it gives us a nice handle . ; So with this we can basically um you know s slaughter the cow any anyway we want . ; Uh . ; It it is It was sort of a it gave us some headache ,
Bmr026_504	Yeah . ; Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap . ; I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , ; Right .
Bro022_368	there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , ; or something ; Mm - hmm . ; to make it
Bmr016_1486	I didn't get that , ; OK . ; Yeah , and so , you know , I mean , th th I have there are some , um , Americans who who are using this " eh " too , ; and I haven't listened to it systematically ,
Bmr020_911	Beep - ify ! ; OK , ; now one thing that prevented us from apply you you from applying ; Exactly .
Bmr026_255	It 'd be easy enough to add that . ; Again it 's it 's It 's more Tcl - T ; Yeah . ; So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it ,
Buw001_452	Somebody who 's part of the meeting . ; No , I mean , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker ; But they ; And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on ,
Bmr002_619	and um they have a lot uh big uh , e ; you know , they 're trying to set up a a work bench or something or other . ; And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1630	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But I think none of this is stuff that really needs somebody doing these these uh , uh , explicit markings .
Bro019_1357	Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does . ; Mmm . ; So n neural network uh , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you ; trying to f
Bed017_366	Or Andy , for that matter ? ; OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . ; Um , so maybe just a a little background on on my visit . ; So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment ,
Bmr020_1142	so the idea initially was , we would get uh , for the new meetings , ; so the e EDU meetings , that Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . ; And um , ; so , I 've assigned I 've I 've assigned them to our transcribers
Bmr024_750	I mean ; And , just have a marking . ; Yeah . ; If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that .
Bmr006_304	but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . ; Yeah . ; Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . ; We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it .
Bmr009_1068	Well it 's I mean I you can sort of identify ; Geek region . ; it f It 's it 's not not that that 's ; Is different . Is different .
Bro028_715	I mean , this this may not help us , uh , in the evaluation ; but it might help us in our understanding at least . ; We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties , ; and show that , uh , " well , OK , not changing it , playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . But in fact if we did that , it made a a big difference . "
Bmr024_1188	A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features . ; Cool . ; And ; Yeah , I got confused by the results .
Bmr016_750	Yeah . ; Right . ; OK . ; Definitely
Bmr006_913	No . ; From , eh , em , Cambridge University . ; Oh ! ; What 's it written in ?
Bmr024_1534	And , uh , with this , I have to leave . ; Hmm ! ; OK . ; So , is there something quick about Absinthe that you ?
Bmr016_1038	Oh , I 'm tr talking about Transcriber . ; Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ? ; Yeah . ; It was also true of the digits task which was X Waves .
Bns002_790	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK ? ; But , anyway , uh , well , depending on on the network , you now , the the the this
Bro027_1996	Uh , ; and ; What 's September sixth ? ; Uh , that 's during Eurospeech .
Bmr020_1214	I didn't I didn't understand that . ; OK . ; So , ; I 'm @ @ now I 'm confused .
Bns002_710	is it not possible to extend the power until the maximum ; u ; and if uh I do not have any connectivity with the maximum of power , OK , then I 'm lost anyway . ; e
Bmr003_2047	These six tables here , with with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . ; OK . ; I see . ; Which es would
Bmr009_1374	U ; I mean . I I would think that these categories would be more w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself . ; I think that that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst . ; OK .
Bdb001_560	And then at the prosody - level we have frame sort of like cepstral feature files , ; Yep . ; uh , like these P - files or anything like that . ; And that 's sort of the world of things that I
Bmr016_720	Yeah , in another way , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns003_685	They are not involved in in research ? ; Yeah . ; You know ; What they are doing then ?
Bed010_150	n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . ; Uh - huh . ; OK ? ; So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need .
Bro007_599	so ; so in some ways he just got his payback , ; but uh again I I don't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_903	Wow . ; Hmm . ; But if that ; then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss
Bro008_36	yeah . ; Uh , so , uh , that 's probably something wrong with the features that we get from OGI . ; Uh , and Sunil is working on on trying to to check everything . ; Oh ,
Bro021_82	And ; Yeah . ; And Yeah , it the C - one is ; There are strange strange thing happening with C - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be different .
Bed004_563	And ; this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um ; we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content . ; Now , the content
Bmr007_436	what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; In in the sense that i if you said if i i i
Bro003_523	but but on the other hand it might be better . ; Right , but if it 's better , it may be better because it was hand - labeled . ; Oh yeah , ; but still @ @ probably use it .
Bmr016_1291	OK . ; No , they 're events . ; They 're actually They have the status of events . ; OK .
Bsr001_591	Wow . ; I mean , I couldn't type . ; That 's an interesting language model I 'm sure . ; Uh .
Bro018_230	This is for the other one . ; I should I can't show that . ; OK . ; But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone .
Bro011_88	Oh OK . ; We should have a look first at , perhaps , the modulation spectrum . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro010_952	Yeah . ; Forced alignment on the sub - band labels ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1376	yeah . ; One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything . ; Hmm . ; Because you end up p p p
Bmr028_665	I didn't hear anything after that . ; The only reason I 'm asking is , you 're gonna need space to split them up . ; And so I wanted to make sure we had some available for you . ; I still have , like , probably six , seven , eight gig on my disk .
Bmr020_276	but still it 's You know , the difference between um between that number and what we have in meetings , ; which is more like , you know , close to in meetings like these , uh you know , close to twenty percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But what was it like , say , in the Robustness meeting , for instance ?
Bed008_87	Why , ; and so forth . ; yeah . ; So I 'll let
Bro017_329	That 's what masking experiments tell you . ; But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands ; when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands . ; And that 's how you make uh decisions .
Btr001_1712	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bns002_530	Mm - hmm . ; So this transmission won't take place . ; OK , ; yeah .
Bed012_207	Mm - hmm . ; because there 'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence . ; Mm - hmm . ; But since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff
Bed006_269	and then goes in and solves the task with the system , ; IE Fey , ; and um ; and we 're gonna try out that
Btr002_514	and they 're getting picked up on more channels , um , than their own channel . ; That would make that would make some sense . ; Yeah . ; Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing .
Bro007_31	So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths . ; So ; Yeah . ; Three , OK .
Bmr027_1232	I mean , if you wanna go , we can just throw it in at the end . ; No , no . Why don't you why don't you go ahead ; since it 's short . ; Um , well , uh .
Bro003_1642	So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things , ; but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet . ; Um , ; and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff ,
Bmr006_1544	Well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity , ; we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . ; So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . ; On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name .
Bmr026_184	So it might just be slides . ; Yeah , OK . ; Well , we 'll see , um ; Well Yeah .
Bsr001_2594	Digit strings , ; That 's right . ; yeah . ; Wow ,
Bed006_153	uh ; So it was really Carol Snow who was confused , not me and not Jerry . ; Yep , yep , yep . ; OK .
Bed013_856	I 've blocked every aspect of Phil Collins out of my mind . ; Sussudio . ; What ? ; I 'm sorry , I haven't .
Bed005_613	or , I don't know ; does this make sense to you ? ; Or ; Yeah . Especially if we want
Bro011_383	I ; That 's right . ; You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things ; Yeah .
Bmr029_522	Y you know , d d b the most important , of course , is the cepstral mean subtraction . ; Yeah . ; And that ; I don't know if we
Bed016_590	um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could . ; No , it doesn't say it at all . No . ; Even though One could argue what if there are basic cases , even . ; I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free .
Btr002_1301	Hmm . ; Right . ; So . ; But i it was , um , really rather minimal .
Bmr019_1934	I mean , at the same time ? ; No . ; Oh , you haven't ! ; I 'm not we we Oh , and you haven't done this either .
Bro004_976	yeah , ; one single KL to transform everything ; or uh , ; Right .
Bmr016_1011	Yeah , if you try to load s really long waveform into X Waves , you 'll be waiting there for ; And middle . ; No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file , ; Oh
Bed017_707	So and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . ; He was in the White House , ; I don't remember what he was saying . ; A anyway , like that .
Bro017_437	When he knew you were happy , ; huh ? ; Yeah . ; So I I said " well , yeah , OK " so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out .
Bmr012_1386	So it it 's a it 's a project goes over the course of one semester . ; Great . ; So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . ; Tell about
Bns002_869	How often do you use less power than the maximum ? ; Well , this will this will be connected to the motion pattern . ; OK ? ; Depending how nodes are moving ,
Bro026_661	So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight . ; Seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . ; Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold , ; and they shouldn't even care about what the score is .
Bmr008_770	Mmm . ; But you have a lot of stratification in any region . ; and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1843	I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or even words inserted that weren't weren't there . ; Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong
Bed012_168	and , um and this is pretty , uh indifferent , ; then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where , uh t uh , he does want to go there . ; Uh , out of curiosity , is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes ? into one smaller subnet ? ; that would just basically be the question for
Bns003_267	you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU , ; So there are some gaps . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Btr001_544	which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others , ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , yeah . ; Mmm .
Bns002_862	So , I I I you know , ask uh You Feel free to ask uh whatever you want , ; but I I want to insist that it was just an uh a simplified uh version , a light version . ; OK ? ; well , uh you know finally this algorithm , eh , as I was telling , eh what it 's doing is to check with the receiver the power level to be used .
Btr001_1762	Right . ; Yeah . ; but it 's not a actual laugh , ; Right ,
Bdb001_1303	Um ; So so imagine ; I think his his example is a good one . ; Imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time .
Bed011_722	will we have bic ; I mean is this realistic ? ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bro010_422	Yeah , ; we no nnn ; be before everything . ; OK ,
Bmr009_461	It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases . ; Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel , ; cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1250	Mm - hmm . ; And for each s uh , frame of the speech the only thing that I need to do is to calculate this ; in order to calculate the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech . ; So , I 'm I 'm not following this perfectly
Btr001_2723	So we should be adding the breaks if ; Yes . ; Well , see er also , this has been a a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like uh one long string ; Oh , OK .
Bmr019_1193	Right . ; so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , um , you know , comma and things like that , ; and we kept the and disfluency dashes uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_479	Yeah . ; and ; Mmm . ; I have asked people why
Bns001_953	so so if uh if it 's already part of the UMTS standardization then uh it 's immediately finished , ; like , OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ? ; And if it 's not in there yet well , it could be a suggestion ; and then the hardware people will make it part u like the ETSI or whatever where U wherever UMTS is standardized they will d well , go for it .
Bed014_1061	Well m @ @ you know , w maybe Mond - Maybe we can put This is part of what we can do Monday , if we want . ; Yeah . I ; OK . ; Alright .
Bro023_714	I m I mean ; Mm - hmm . ; pick one . ; yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series .
Bmr013_526	Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? ; Well , you know , I mean they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , ; so I mean I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . ; Yeah .
Bro010_188	So . ; Huh . ; So , yeah . ; Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency ,
Bmr006_778	So so I start at the bottom , so " silence " is clear . ; By " speech " do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? ; Speech ; So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one .
Btr001_1377	We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it , ; you know , the methodology . ; How do they do this . ; Mmm .
Bed006_368	Yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction , ; Uh - huh . ; right ? ; That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things
Bro014_620	you know , we had the MFCC 's before , ; lots of people have done voice activity detectors , ; Mm - hmm . ; you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline ,
Bmr007_923	and , uh e e you know , as as as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal , ; Yeah . ; Do something . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr027_1125	So , ; you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ Adam 's right . ; Yeah . ; It probably won't do any better .
Bed006_469	OK , so that 's good . ; That 's better than running into problems . ; OK . ; And um I I do have some good news for the natural language generation however .
Bed004_856	Right . ; OK , yeah ? ; I had one more thing . ; I don't remember .
Buw001_288	And so ; And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval ; even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . ; Right .
Bed006_1159	It 's I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know train station London before , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Yep .
Bed017_299	wh to start with . ; Yeah . ; Well ; Yeah .
Bed015_1342	Uh - huh . ; blah - blah - blah . ; And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning ; I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place .
Bmr029_911	Yeah . The segmentations from Don ? ; But th the segmentations are only they only affect the test set . ; Once we ? ; Oh .
Bmr011_1430	um I have two questions . ; One of them is , um , Jerry Feldman 's group , ; they they , uh , are they ; I know that they recorded one meeting .
Bro010_485	Yeah . ; Uh , ; and there 's this ; I guess there 's this mysterious
Bed014_493	So assume these are two , uh , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr020_343	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . ; We also fixed the transcripts in in numerous ways .
Bmr003_1087	Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour . ; And who ; who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ? ; Yeah , they won't .
Bro004_1028	So they 're they 're doing the the VAD ; I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence ; So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , I believe . ; Um I asked uh Hynek whether
Bmr001_136	There 's more equipment in there . ; But there 's the idea is that there are these microphones on the table , ; there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat , ; and then that 's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there .
Bmr011_1736	Right . ; Right ? ; And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by , uh by any room acoustics ; or is it just uh , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ?
Bro018_381	No ? ; Well , it says , since you 're taking a natural log , it says that when when you get down to essentially zero energy , this is gonna be the natural log of one , which is zero . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 'll go down to uh to the natural log being
Bmr014_104	You you wanna volunteer to do that ? ; Sure . ; OK . ; Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .
Bmr012_853	Don't stop . ; Keep going . ; Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters , ; Yeah .
Bns002_1534	pair ; pair ; Perez . ; Not Parez , Peire .
Bro007_168	Those look pretty good . ; Um let 's see that one ; Well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right ? ; That 's just uh
Bmr022_1411	And they 're certainly gonna wanna change tools . ; Yeah . ; And so you know , it 's the same as source code . ; You you release source code at some point .
Bed015_870	Mm - hmm . ; And then you 're left with a couple three . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do ,
Bed009_1076	So that 's what we 're really doing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And ; Nancy is going to
Bed002_59	And the short form ; I mean , you should read the consent form , ; but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . ; So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like .
Bmr031_958	Yeah , they 're like those . ; right ? ; Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately . ; OK .
Bns003_704	Ah yeah em nnn , not really . ; You know , there is . ; There is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1191	and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path ; so that it doesn't introduce uh , any more delay . ; I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay ; but at the same time the LDA down here
Buw001_2047	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; as you could be with these things hanging on you . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr013_358	Right . ; So people purposely don't add them . ; Right . ; So it 's useful to know which variant was was produced , at least at the phone level .
Bmr020_780	Yeah . ; So , for the thing that ; That 's good . ; We need to give Brian the beeps file ,
Bmr003_910	The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from ? ; Right . ; Or the boundaries . ; Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to
Bed006_287	Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . ; So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the that information ; and An ; It w it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way
Bmr011_223	And then , ; So does the recognizer . ; Oh , really ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1131	Yeah . ; Right . ; So . ; And then , uh , UW
Bro017_505	David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm ; and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent ; he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines ? ; Yeah .
Bro019_507	S ; So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second . ; So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here ; Yeah .
Bed009_354	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yep .
Bmr005_463	Yeah , silent , ground ; to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . ; Oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1159	however , glossing it ; so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , ; and a couple of others , ; not many .
Bmr009_862	I know , OK . ; Yeah , he 's been setting stuff up and going away . So . ; That 's a good point . ; I see .
Bmr020_1500	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , we have the unintelligibility convention . ; And actually they have one also ,
Bdb001_897	but they 'll all have a similar nature . ; They 'll be looking at either a word - level prosodic , uh , an a value , ; like a continuous value , ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_693	I don't know if that 's true or not ; but let 's as ; Well , it 's definitely true with the segment . ; Right .
Bmr006_840	Yeah . ; So , this is this is a subset . ; Yeah . ; In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class ,
Bro014_1364	Yeah . ; Right ? ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_514	And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , ; and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . ; So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " . ; Hmm .
Bed013_1073	i ; Yeah . ; What did we decide . ; We decided sort of the the prototypical " where is X " , where you know , we don't really know , does he wanna go there , or just wanna know where it is .
Bro024_1886	Is that the reason ? ; And in your case it 's all all noisy , ; All noisy , ; yeah .
Bro017_1130	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2468	Yes . ; And people are just hysterical ; and they 're like , " What were we talking about ? ; I don't know " .
Bmr010_79	OK . ; Um , and , um , the other thing , uh , ; which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , ; which is that , um ,
Bro026_422	Right . ; Uh . ; Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? ; Yeah .
Bed017_311	OK . ; Then I think the w long term perspective is is pretty clear . ; We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , ; if , when , and how ,
Bed008_227	Mm - hmm . ; And um ; Oops . ; Is
Bmr003_587	Yeah , ; as a pilot study . ; It this is this is like five times real time or ten times real time ; Ten times about ,
Bro003_743	Without the net it 's just baseline . ; Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too . ; D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1015	We always have some compression . ; We always have some you know , the the the kind of filter bank with a kind of quasi - log scaling . ; Um , if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it ; i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , uh , um , uh , auditory front - ends .
Bro007_510	No , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to ; eh I don't know if it 's three PM it 's ; Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Three PM here is in Europe midnight .
Bmr014_528	it was spelled GABBL ; Sort of how it sounds . ; Yes . ; More of an attempt to
Btr001_43	and then the technical set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface . ; OK , ; so , ; maybe we could just , um , start with issues of the @ @ the tar ti up there at the top of
Bmr018_632	Right . ; or there was a short you know , someone was jiggling with a cord ; But ; or , uh , I extracted it incorrectly ,
Bro021_946	and we can put u that n the log domain ; Yeah . ; log of X omega , ; but , well , in the time domain we have an exponential .
Bmr011_1240	Yep , just features . ; Then just say ; Yeah , describe describe it . ; Mmm .
Bro026_68	Yeah ? ; It worked good ? ; Yeah , it works . ; Oh , good !
Bmr011_1461	Right . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Right . That was a big fear . ; That 's important .
Bmr008_709	Now , I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak . ; Right . ; But , other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_527	Right . ; It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ? ; Uh ; I don't know how different they are from each other .
Bro014_1585	or a ; Um , I was thinking more like using them as as the inputs to to the detectors . ; or a feature or something . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr031_1567	And then ; and do you ? ; a There 's there 's a whole bunch of , um , sort of unknowns . ; Right .
Bmr008_1740	Yeah . ; What was the bug that you found ? ; What the bu ; The bug from last uh meeting ?
Bro004_848	I mean , we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note . ; Um , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ? ; Uh , Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1750	The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that and they sort of swap . ; I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1153	Oh , I don't know . ; And And Um And usually here people here know what is their kind of mmm lang English language ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; That 's a joke .
Bsr001_1853	absolutely . ; Yeah . ; I think that would be excellent . ; And , uh , it will really help the design too .
Bmr007_733	Yeah , but It 's it would be trivial ; It would be another task . ; It would be a research task . ; Having having ground tu truth would be nice , so seat number would be good .
Bmr025_272	I think we 'll be OK with that . ; Right . ; Assuming we 're ; What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ?
Btr001_972	all the different ways of reducing " and " . ; That 's true . ; Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , ; and the same thing for , um , well " the " . " The " versus " the "
Bro023_627	Do you assume the noise is the same ? ; Yeah . ; in yeah , after the speech starts . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_332	uh , shall I start from ; Well I don't know how may I how ; OK . ; Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe .
Bro016_1064	Um . ; Yeah . I think the ; just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_56	Technical stuff we 'll do uh another day . ; Probably next week . ; But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . ; And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues .
Bro004_549	At least at least for the first for the well - matched , ; Well matched condition . ; yeah . ; Right .
Bns003_751	You can change that . ; Yeah , ; sure . ; M uh , maybe you sh
Bns002_1503	You see that in the ICSI US on the U S A side , I believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah yeah . ; Yeah ?
Bmr016_852	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate . ; OK .
Bmr030_463	No . ; Yeah . ; The the disadvantage of doing it this way is it 's real time . ; So you would have to sit there for an hour while it 's recording .
Bed006_1714	Mm - hmm . ; which is , ; yeah , It 's fine ; so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say " well if you really look at it , you just need our RAD . "
Bro004_116	I mean , my assump ; From what I saw from the earlier results , uh I guess last week , was that um , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . ; Mmm . Yeah . ; But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ?
Bed015_365	which is an argument structure construction ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic
Bed010_653	I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Those are two - point .
Bro024_186	I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech ; Huh . ; but it might make a difference . ; I don't know .
Btr002_898	" backspace " . ; Oh , OK . So you just do it that way . ; " Shift " , " backspace " to c collapse it , yeah . ; That 's that 's what I do ,
Bed005_630	OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? ; How how would we try to characterize those ; and what do we want to request now that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_396	And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . ; So then , in any case , um ; But paying a lit ; You know , if i if it 's uh
Bro017_834	And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had . ; No that would be very good match , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_945	Yeah . ; Sure . ; And I just don't know , ; I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , uh , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to .
Buw001_253	I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , ; Right . ; uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . ; Right .
Bed003_646	Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities , ; Yeah .
Bro005_1225	Well , what 's a reasonable number ? ; Perhaps be because if it 's if it 's too large or large ; or @ @ ; Um , well I don't think we 're um completely off the wall .
Bed003_304	because it 's because have the the time of day ; OK , " closed " sort of is . ; and the close ; it just had the er and what time it closed .
Bmr019_1848	Yeah . ; So it 's background crunching . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro012_392	Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro019_908	the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices . ; So it it ac ; the covariance matrix of the noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1735	That 's true . ; That 's complicated . ; too . ; Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ?
Bro025_439	And then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net ; Yeah . ; because in the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on after frame - dropping . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_981	This wasn't developed by th these regions weren't ; if you 're a TI or MIT from nineteen eighty - five . ; Yeah ; Yeah .
Bns001_451	I think we should ; In this thing of seamless handoff or handovers should think more maybe in different layers ? ; So one layer is having the seamless handover . ; It 's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service , you can't do magic and have it .
Bed003_1280	Then we have context . ; Yeah . ; So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes - nets of their own . ; Yep .
Bro028_88	And i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size ; Uh , no , I don't think so . ; in terms of ? ; No .
Buw001_1485	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr014_504	and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . ; And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas . ; Right . ; Uh and so
Bro019_751	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m ; the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .
Bed015_714	Yeah . ; Great . ; Um , ; the I w I would just
Bro013_54	OK . ; It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? ; Nnn . ; It 's
Bmr029_462	Oh , OK . ; So , does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it ? Or you just let it do what it would do , an ? ; No . It means No . It just means ; you you group together the segments that by magic you know belong to one speaker ,
Bro007_19	Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered ; Yeah ; so ; yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard
Bsr001_1226	Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless ; and can they afford the P Z ; and that sort of stuff . ; And he said something about a portable You know , that they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like like you guys have here .
Bro028_1187	So they 're they 're really pretty related ; and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll see the the connections a little better ; Hmm . ; and connect them .
Bmr003_838	And the the format 's really transparent . ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; It 's just a matter of a very c clear
Bed004_392	and see ; start at the at the bottom ; and ; Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop .
Btr002_3183	So , " I mean , er , " ; Right , right . ; th that that that stays . ; Mmm
Bro028_713	And we may end up being in a situation where we just you know really can't change the word insertion penalty . ; But the other thing we could do is also we could ; I mean , this this may not help us , uh , in the evaluation ; but it might help us in our understanding at least .
Buw001_1094	Uh , let the record show the light is flickering . ; The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . ; I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bro019_429	They 're going to give the endpoint information . ; I see . ; G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway , ; everybody does that ,
Bed006_609	But they 're shown like on a screen . ; It 's a I mean so would the generator , ; N ; like the English language sentence of it is " these are the follow you know the following films are being shown " or something like that ?
Bmr021_393	yep . ; You know , lists like " original wavefile , start , end " . ; Start end . ; Yep , the way Feacalc calc does it .
Bmr025_187	Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format . ; Right . ; Yeah that sounds good . ; And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally
Bmr022_177	Yeah . ; Yeah , very low . ; Yeah . ; You sort of might end up with some infinities there ,
Bmr008_564	Right . ; That is kind of nice . ; What ; what about just doing the the sort of the Steve suggestion , uh , as as an add - on to it ,
Bro023_744	So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that . ; And ; So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate ; but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames .
Bro023_920	Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated . ; And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , um , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated ; Mm - hmm . ; or assuming , uh , ergodicity that i that i um , across time , uh , it 's uncorrelated .
Bmr018_172	OK . ; This experiment of just ; Well we had we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good choice , though . ; Well , whatever we have .
Bro027_913	uh , ; we have to find a way to decrease the number of features . ; Um ; So , it seems funny that I don't know , maybe I don't u quite understand everything , but that adding features
Bmr018_1438	um , I wo it was ; Columbia have anything ? ; No . ; no it was
Bmr009_1324	Does that make sense ? ; South Midwest ? ; That would help me ; Yeah .
Bmr006_900	Right . ; And my idea is ; " Tone " , whatever . ; so so on because I have a pitch extractor yet .
Bro011_363	You were talking about that , yeah . ; I see . ; And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . ; So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use
Bmr013_425	Yeah , so I mean , what , what where this is , I mean , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , ; so it should be something broader . ; But , The but uh where I 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , um , uh , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature . ; OK .
Bed002_655	and ; No . ; But l ; OK .
Btr001_2108	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; So , um ; That 's good .
Bmr026_941	Exactly . ; So so that was the other thing . ; Yeah . ; And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .
Bmr027_1415	Fi - five minute report or something . ; It 's up to you . ; I don't ; Whatever you want .
Bmr030_686	Experiments ? ; That 's ; Yeah , I guess that 's probably next . ; Yeah .
Bed008_174	is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gonna have to be updated ; and n it 's not a belief update , ; right ? ; It 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff ,
Bro014_1341	Cool ! ; Oh , that 's clean . ; the same cle ; Oh , OK
Bro026_568	Mm - hmm . ; So what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? ; Uh , I remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gonna give the system out or ; Yeah .
Bro005_352	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bmr008_1045	Well , it 's an it 's an interesting identifier , I I now that I realize the und the reason for it . ; The That 's true too . ; Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time , someone 's email could change . ; Right .
Bmr006_1646	We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case . ; And it and it may very well be I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . ; Yeah . ; And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one .
Buw001_237	and and , uh , they were fine with it . ; But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , uh , the summar " ; Well , I asked them to ; and none of them did .
Bmr016_101	Right ? ; So if you if if you have uh ; Six dash one , you mean ? ; if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one .
Bed011_952	Uh Yeah . OK . ; But uh ; Well , I will tell you the German tourist data . ; OK .
Bmr021_534	Maybe n next week if we could . ; OK . ; I 'm trying to finish up some stuff . ; Yeah sure . I 'd like to
Bns003_837	I would like to have it . ; Sorry . ; Well ; but oder ?
Bmr005_102	But there are a lot of different things like that . ; So , do you think his interest is in using this as a data source , ; or training material , ; or what ?
Bro019_1236	And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_529	I I don't know if these are word error rates ; because they 're really big . ; So , under condition one here it 's ten percent . ; Then under three it goes to sixty - four point six percent .
Bed014_1024	Monday ? ; OK , whate I mean What I think Robert 's saying is that ; Earlier in the week ; earlier we
Bmr023_703	the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , ; even though there are huge speaker effects . ; So . ; The but the main limitation now is I because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker .
Bsr001_603	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm , ; yeah . ; In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on ,
Bmr003_760	It 's really the i the interface is wonderful ; because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , and then you press the return key . ; But then , you know , it 's like , uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . ; But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key
Bmr022_1094	Mm - hmm . ; I had another thought . ; So th I don't think that 's a good solution . ; Would w would it be possi
Bmr019_1677	um , you know , ; Oh . ; and go back and fix them . ; Yeah .
Bed013_71	based on certain intentions . ; So in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance . ; Hmm . ; Well , like in AI they generally do the take in ,
Bro004_599	Yeah . ; So that 's matched training ? ; Is that what that is ? ; It 's
Bmr022_1341	and how that impacts the amount of changing that 's done . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I think that it 's , um , ; I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made .
Bed014_252	and what we know about that . ; Where ; Where the " where is " construction is . ; OK .
Bmr027_495	the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy ; uh , ; h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_268	but he 's putting in something , ; because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , ; which are then being subtracted from the speech . ; And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number
Bro005_401	Mm - hmm . ; And we s we can ; first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , ; and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing .
Bed016_227	Uh , ; which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , ; or in the Bavaria example , ; you just want to know where it is .
Bns001_214	Yeah ? ; Yes . ; Yes , ; OK .
Bmr010_322	But as far a you know , uh , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project . ; Oh . ; But you s ; What our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .
Bro021_1296	I estimate mean and variance for each one of the Gaussian of the codebook . ; No , I 'm talking about the noise . ; Oh , ; um . Well , only one
Bmr022_922	Yes . ; That 's that it looks sort of like that . ; Except that one 's even bigger than most of the ones I 've seen . ; So where where does how do you wear that ?
Bed011_940	um ; W You know , whatever form they use is fine . ; OK . ; But I I think that probably we 're gonna try to look at it as you know , s what semantic constructions d do we do we want them to uh do direc
Bmr028_446	Um . Oh . And also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms . ; Specifically in the NSA ones , ; and I noticed that when I tried to , uh uh , generate the transcripts for NSA . That there are a few with no speaker forms . ; And so , uh , I have a I sent out yet another this morning , which I think makes six total emails that I 've sent to these people ,
Bmr012_1288	Yeah . ; What what ; That would be weird . ; It 's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break
Bro025_53	uh , but it is , uh , worse on the , uh , Aurora ; It 's worse on ; I mean on the , uh , TI - TI - digits , ; on the multi - condition in TI - digits . Yeah .
Bro005_178	Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter , ; well , ; or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter ; and that there is some DC offset in the Italian ,
Bmr016_1131	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Exactly . ; OK .
Bmr028_914	So . ; But you 're saying for this For the adaptation , you mean . ; So , d s so fo not well , for everything . ; for adaptation . Right .
Bro003_796	Because more people ; Yeah , ; probably so . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_51	Oh , it 's three percent on on , uh , on Hub - five . ; On ; Hub - five . ; I see .
Bns001_818	So how do you want to focus on network services . ; Cuz if you go to the app ; If you ; For me that 's starting with middleware aspects ,
Bed015_1759	we we were talking about sarcasm too , right ? ; Oh , oh . ; I mean , ; Oh , yeah , yeah , right .
Bed015_2146	because you what you want are these generalized rules ; about the way things relate , ; th that you then instantiate in each case . ; And then then instantiate them .
Bro023_632	but that 's not the case in , uh , many many of our cases ; but it works reasonably well . ; I see . ; And and then you What you do is you , uh b
Bmr008_1170	And then it would come back to me with saying " well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , " ; so it was very much sort of " Leader " and and and and " Led " sort of relationship . ; And um the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher , uh , in this l meeting , uh , you are my graduate student , ; but uh it 's not taking that kind of role at all ,
Btr001_1167	Mistreat ? Oh ! ; Yeah , ; then come back and finish the meet ; well that 's that 's some good motivation to not start a half hour later .
Bro022_890	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; So , yeah . ; It it might be that what I did is
Bro024_1635	Mm - hmm . ; And and you are looking into the future , into the past . ; Right . ; And smoothing .
Bed009_700	Hmm . ; and you can use the same language core , understanding core to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1276	Y Yeah . ; It 's sort of ; that that Not the best ; Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point
Bmr016_207	I think that i it 's fine . ; I it it to me it looks like you 've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr024_1353	Pruning in the ? ; Well , he was he 's it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different , ; Yeah , the likelihoods were lower for the PLP . ; as I recall .
Bed015_1247	So , I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at . ; The " scenario " box , ; like , what does that look like for an example ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_141	So , you can now run your experiments on that machine ; and you can run five at a time ; and it runs , uh , as fast as , you know , uh , five different machines . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_683	Right . ; Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case . ; Right . ; Cuz that that 's the real goal .
Bmr030_603	Actually there are a few I saw a web - based one at one point . ; Web - based ? ; Where you could send them audio files over the web ; and they send you back text files over the web .
Btr001_379	Like his English fluency got better ? ; I remember in the beginning you had and you were just sorta like you were beating your head against the wall , ; Oh , I went crazy . ; but I it go but it got better , it got better .
Bro026_491	Right ? ; Yeah . ; Um . ; And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS ,
Bns001_556	I as lo uh as the as the user is moving out of the of the coverage area of this second network . ; And , well , what they have built is a a kind of uh proxy structure . ; So they are they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies . ; So the client or the server is not changed .
Bmr001_271	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Certainly you can get some ; Well we could I mean .
Bro004_1259	what I mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that the the silence model in HTK will always pick it up . ; Yeah .
Bro015_171	Uh , continuing readings we come Uh . We 're doing some background reading on phonetics . ; Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed017_752	Mm - hmm . ; and ; um , ; I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now ,
Bro028_423	Mm - hmm . ; which is mostly , uh , noise . ; I mean not periodic . ; So , what what do you mean exactly by putting back the pitch in ?
Bsr001_1655	I don't know . ; It it really i ; Cuz that 's actually my interest at the moment , so . ; It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that .
Bro005_1092	Uh . You mean ; Oh , yeah ! ; Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? ; Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK .
Bmr031_807	and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are transcribed ? ; Yeah . The the pie chart shows actually m meetings that are , ; uh ; it combines the categories of , you know , " currently in "
Bed014_1452	It 's great exercise , I must say . ; I can't wait to hear this . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh , definitely . They have , like , places instead of like Yeah , instead of karaoke bars now that have , like , DDR ,
Bro014_505	and ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_65	Didn't get the door . ; Oh , you just get the door now . ; But he didn't shut the door . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1171	Normally a note taker would know not to do that . ; OK . ; Ha ! ; Yeah .
Bed006_1161	Right . ; Yep . ; Well . ; yeah .
Bmr028_1541	Actually , I think of cheating as a way to do some work , where you can't address all of the computational tasks . ; Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection . ; But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck , ; even though automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out .
Bmr008_1188	but ; Yeah . ; But what I what I was thinking uh the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common . ; Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise .
Bro025_140	I need to allow it to do everything and even more more than this . ; Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of ; Right . ; Parameters . Yeah .
Bro004_1301	Yeah . ; Just curious . ; How are we doing on the resources ? ; Disk , and
Bmr013_923	cuz I would save a lot of , uh , time , dividing things . ; Yeah , some of them are quite long . ; Just from ; I dunno
Btr002_2878	That 's interesting . ; Uh - huh . ; and , um ; th cuz the claim had been ,
Bed013_181	Right ? ; And ; Well , it will d r assign values to all the nodes . Yes . ; Yes . And come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes .
Bro013_609	and um ; Yeah . ; so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies . ; That 's as as a separate thing .
Bmr005_116	And and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it 's plausible at least . ; It 's possible . ; Uh , he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically ; Yeah .
Bed017_173	for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . ; And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , ; and that makes a ; I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that .
Bro021_118	There was something you were gonna uh , some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency . ; I don't know if that was ; I guess it was ; I don't know .
Bmr016_1884	And those of course get get picked up in the frequency check ; glosses . ; because you see " beep " ; Right .
Bro019_525	Mm - hmm . ; It was system one . ; So ; OK .
Bmr008_310	Well I guess I was thinking maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ? ; So , s can we get ; Mm - hmm . ; Could we put one more thing on here maybe ?
Bmr001_349	with a trip to Leo 's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless , ; and uh right now we could have three more three more people wearing mikes like this , and that would just work . ; I mean I 'm not sure how how good the quality is on this mike but I think it 's going to be OK . ; So we could actually have eight people with with headset mikes with , I mean , basically no extra effort .
Bed004_614	Yeah . ; Right . ; Right . ; Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case .
Bmr009_110	Then , that 's a problem right there . ; So . I think you should at least be able , ; Oh yeah . ; doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . "
Bmr011_1144	And actually as you get transcripts just , um , for new meetings , um , we can try ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , the the more data we have to try the the alignments on , um , the better . ; So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers ,
Bmr010_1423	Yeah . It was only Gaussian . ; Oh , I see . I see . ; And and ; This is the idea .
Bro004_227	but but uh , uh the same task and so on . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we call that " one " , then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using uh different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , it 's one point one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1770	Yeah , ; that 's something that needs to be done ; in any event . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_199	Um , ; but uh , other than that delightful result , what was the rest of the paper about ? ; Um , ; well it was about it had three sections
Bmr031_1309	Um , on the recognition side , actually , um , I think the main person doing that is , uh , Harriet from Harriet Nock from , uh formerly of Cambridge . ; Yeah . ; Um , and apparently they get reasonable results ; except in some portions they get very high insertion rates
Bro023_1230	Hmm . ; Uh , ; people d done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets . ; And it 's not a bad thing to do .
Bdb001_727	The the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract , um find and extract information in a structure of this type ? ; So . ; That 's good . ; So you gave some examples like
Btr001_2441	OK , ; my joke 's over , ; you know , you can stop laughing now " . ; Right .
Bmr007_959	" Mixed ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; Sorry . ; And and then you you , eh you try to to apply that , eh , eh , eh , speech recognizer to that signal , to the PDA , eh speech file , I I think you will have problems , because the the the the condition you you will need t t I I suppose that you will need to to to retrain it .
Bmr027_1195	I 'm using one of these . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I think I have a pair that I brought from home ,
Bmr011_299	So . ; Yeah , OK . ; Yeah . ; Sorry .
Btr002_817	Just to jump it back . ; Yeah . ; Interesting . ; Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear It 'll be in right in the middle of the timebin ,
Bro003_892	I think what they were saying was that , um , for this next test there 's gonna be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you 're not . ; Like ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_692	um so ; Right . ; if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1174	because sometimes I have to listen to audio files ; and I don't have to b go borrow it from someone ; and ; We have actua actually I have
Bmr008_322	OK . ; um and then I put " Optional " with a big " Optional " in parentheses , Age . ; Wait , why is that optional ? ; Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down .
Bed015_396	Right . ; I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_448	and sixty for the for highly - mismatched . ; Uh , ; and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit , ; but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched .
Bro028_826	And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . ; Hmm . ; You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation . ; They did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points .
Bed016_500	No , no , no . ; yeah . ; On that one ? ; But that 's the only thing I noticed in there .
Bmr018_979	so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop ; and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases , ; and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around . ; It 's not a simple not a simple problem .
Btr002_1840	and apparently he was pretending ; " Eech - eech " , or something . ; he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ? ; " Whee - whee " .
Bmr021_708	So , first , uh , you know , we had we figured out sometime last week how to um ; and and Chuck wrote this really nice little script Perl script that takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c so - called uh cepstra file , ; which is what the SRI system uses to read features . ; It 's essentially uh uh NIST headered uh waveform .
Bmr009_426	Then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or ; Yeah . ; This is the thing I I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_750	Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this you know , sc eh , higher and higher , you know , powers in these portable things . ; Yeah , it 's not ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro016_748	So ; Mm - hmm . ; so , uh ; MSG is very , very dif
Bmr029_314	Four hours per meeting . ; Right . ; Wow . ; Yeah . But if you So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day .
Bed009_158	Uh he will be in Washington , though . ; Oh that 's true . ; He 's off off on his trip already . ; but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .
Bmr028_1600	I assume you 're saying you want me to get back to it . ; Cuz , y you know ; Well , I was just wondering if i i ; Because I I am finding that , um , in double checking , I 've run across , u um , one data set where the microphone was off early on ,
Btr002_548	I mean , if their auditory capabilities , uh , have been , you know , um , squished down like in a certain place where it would be n easier for a person with normal , um , hearing to hear a male 's voice , ; um , like if I 'm saying if if they d if they had a some sort of , um , you know , damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information , then ; and , i uh , e i u ; if that part of the brain normally codes for , you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer , then they might not be able to .
Bmr001_296	Yeah . ; But on the other hand , suppose that uh , you 're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a PDA to to a meeting ; No , and I don't need to meet with those people . ; and and and therefore you bring it in ,
Buw001_433	But at least it would get us started . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , sure . ; I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like
Bmr019_1305	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed013_927	What about the utterance ? ; That 's here . ; It 's ; Discourse .
Bsr001_1582	so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end ; Uh , what 's ; and we 're thinking of , um , agentifying an EXCEL spreadsheet and having s like some kind of spreadsheet ; So basically , what wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around .
Bmr005_883	Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt , ; or is it ? ; No . ; Nah .
Bmr003_1269	Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1291	or ? ; Well , ; so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do ; Uh - huh .
Bed009_737	So the idea is to uh have a pa y y a particular ; yeah ; Do you have a particular parser in mind ? ; Is it uh partic d
Bro016_232	that , because all that stuff that we 're getting thr the silence that 's getting through is causing insertions . ; So . ; Right . ; Mmm .
Bns002_1127	Yeah , we can discuss later , off - line . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And eh , finally , the other the other thing , which is also under research or under study is , uh to have some kind of a power - aware routing .
Bmr019_760	and you normally allow those to match to any word . ; But then the background speech was also a reject model , ; and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between ; you know , it needs to differentiate between the two .
Bns002_299	I mean , only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node . ; OK ? ; But not to broadcast . Uh , to all the nodes . ; OK .
Bmr016_2011	Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the " NUMS " on it ? ; Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? ; This is more because ; Or
Bro003_1388	and and you 're saying about the Spanish ? ; The Spanish labels ? ; That was in different format , ; Oh , I see .
Btr001_2464	Very interesting . ; Interesting . ; Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time . ; Right .
Bmr016_1472	Them Canadians . ; Onl ; yeah . ; No , only if you don't have lax vowels , I guess .
Bro018_1120	On the far field also . ; He did one PZM channel and one PDA channel . ; Oh did he ? ; Oh !
Bmr003_1460	and maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " . ; Yeah . ; And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , there were two people speaking during part of it ; Yeah .
Bro024_1757	Yeah , you you caught up . ; because ; Yep , ; that 's true .
Bed011_78	these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . ; Any comments I can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly . ; m Yes . ; Let me summarize in two sentences ,
Bro010_934	But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , uh , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . ; Ouch . ; It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_299	no , we 're talking about on the computer ; Right . ; and and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , ; we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have
Bmr005_653	No , it 's ; you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_399	Latency and things . ; latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing , ; Mm - hmm . ; because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers , uh and uh and uh TRAPS .
Btr002_2226	I I 've learned several things about having been Wi - i with the close - talking mikes . ; This is this is a new experience . ; Cuz I have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while , ; but th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably ,
Bmr018_560	Yeah . ; Yeah there was that we ; that 's right , ; we had that one conversation about , uh , what what what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological ,
Btr002_236	Uh - huh . ; Um , ; So y the example is , " That would be hard " ; Or whatever , yeah ,
Bed015_907	" John is on the bus , ; Mm - hmm . ; not Nancy . " ; Hmm .
Bmr010_1490	So those are all things that should be there . ; So far , um , uh , Jose has has been ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_244	Or ? ; Well , in real conversations , ; everyday conversations . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_1740	It 's just comment about what they said . ; Comment . ; Yeah . ; Comment or contextual comment .
Bed003_800	For some reason I had that OK , that was a thought that I had at one point ; but then went away . ; So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? ; Well , for example , if we include that ,
Bmr023_954	Yeah . Does HPF on on his feat feature . ; u And but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1431	and also it 'll go around the c the , uh , ; I wanna say cursor ; but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing . ; Point ,
Bmr020_710	Uh , so it 's " FTP pub ; Pub real . ; real " ; Exactly .
Bro028_348	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_743	just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker . ; Oh ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Btr002_2338	Machines . ; Yeah . ; So , and then of course there are these these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data ; which are these funny sounds people make ,
Bed016_221	then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg ; and someone asks them in the morning The Cave Forty - Five is a is a well - known discotheque ; which is certainly not open at that that time . ; OK .
Bmr015_597	which , um , ; one of them is that , um , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this , ; uh , uh , ; using an interface that has so much more complexity to it .
Btr002_1893	when to put the quotes and when ; And then they were talking about like the difference between " uh " when it 's " a " or when it 's " uh " , ; Yeah . ; and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore .
Bmr005_367	Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session ; Oh , God ! ; in five eh in forty - five minutes . ; Ugh .
Bro023_674	It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise . ; Uh - huh . ; And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way . ; And , uh uh , spectral subtraction is is , uh uh , one approach to it .
Btr002_203	And sometimes that would get transcribed as ; OK , so , let me just think of an example . ; Um , ; OK , let 's say I say , " Well , that would be hard to do , so . "
Bmr006_605	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . ; One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE . ; SPINE .
Bro004_1061	Yeah , ; uh for example , LDA filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . ; Yes . ; And maybe for the Italian , for the TD TE on for Finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set .
Bro024_1404	so I didn't test the spectral subtraction on TI - digits yet . ; Uh , so you have three she sheets . ; One is the um proposal - one system . ; Actually , it 's not exe exactly proposal - one .
Bmr027_1502	very poor , ; very quick . ; Um , ; but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well ,
Bmr029_807	you 'll you 'll we 'll need to get the segmentations . ; Yeah . ; Figure out whether we 're using the new or the old from Don . ; And then ,
Bro027_1127	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1331	So . ; But but but , um ; Well , yeah . ; We can
Bmr012_852	Actually , no . ; Don't stop . ; Keep going . ; Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,
Bro008_278	Uh , standards are always optional . ; It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , ; or Uh um ; And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on .
Bed015_1556	Yeah . ; and this is where blends and all terribl ; Yeah . ; So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't .
Bmr019_165	but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation . ; And , um , ; that was the phone - loop adaptation . ; And then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses .
Bns002_1216	Mm - hmm . ; However , uh some old uh waveLANs are also , but not the older ones the oldest ones , are also uh two point four m ; eh gigahertz . S ; Uh , gigahertz .
Bmr018_216	Mm - hmm . ; and ; I mean , is it pretty easy ? ; I think it 's gonna be one or two times real time at
Bed012_359	Le ; If we trusted the Go - there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones , then we would conclude , even in this situation , that he wanted to go there . ; So , in that sense , we weight them equally ; OK .
Bmr031_383	Yep . ; d Are they doing some nice integer multiple ; or ? ; Excuse me ?
Btr001_849	And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause . ; I don't is it That doesn't make any sense , ; but . ; There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of .
Bmr006_1800	And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . ; Uh - huh . ; But it would be still useful for the ; But if both of those are publically available
Bmr019_1910	Remember to read the transcript number , please . ; And you laughed at me , too , f the first time I said that . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr026_1172	Thirty hours per gender . ; I 'm not sure what this 'll mean . ; In the small training set ? ; Hello ?
Bmr006_71	So this this meeting is one of them , ; although I 'm not sure I can participate if I ; You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_879	Right . ; So what about ; Um ; Did y
Bed009_531	Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse . ; Mm - hmm . ; Of of special interest . ; This is actually the state of the plan .
Bro004_831	it 's it 's an interesting thought . ; I mean we we could disagree about it at length ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_395	And ; Over an entire utterance ? ; Over over the entire c over the entire channel . ; Or windowed ?
Bed010_746	Right . ; That 's cool . ; And so this doe This is , uh ; First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about
Bmr008_1303	um , and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you , off - line Jose ; cuz it 's getting kind of late ; Yeah . ; but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there 's there 's a lot of overlap , in just energy related things
Bns001_269	Yeah . ; Yeah , and This probably has to be a brainstorm right now . ; Yep . ; Um What I told Joachim yesterday was that , uh uh for my company the company I work for , they are more interested in in an explicit service , than in core technology .
Bro025_489	I see . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1131	Hello . ; Dan here . ; Yeah . ; Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ?
Bsr001_1250	Right . ; Mmm . ; and then the post - processing can be uniform and stuff like that , ; Right ,
Bmr028_319	Yeah . ; Well , e everything is faster than Tcl - TK . ; Yeah . ; It 's a string substitution language , basically .
Bns001_1036	And ; So that the ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , but The hype
Bed006_197	me or Bhaskara could either of us could post it to ; uh ; is it ; if it 's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro post it to the news group
Bmr015_359	Yeah . ; I should go back and look . ; I didn't I don't think that 's true . ; Yeah , OK .
Bsr001_704	I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_551	What you save , I mean , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah ; There 's ; I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . ; Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space .
Bmr014_180	No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , ; OK . ; OK . ; I see .
Bns002_1352	Well in this case , I 'm using a resource which is not owned by my provider . ; I 'm using , a let 's say , a private property . ; Maybe I have to pay to this private property , ; or maybe my carrier will have to pay or to refund some money to this guy .
Bed008_407	So here here 's what it looks like to me . ; is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . ; So that it uh ; that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important
Bro012_926	the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM with these two kinds of parameters . ; And , well , it 's better with variance normalization . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_980	Yep . ; Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when . ; OK . OK . ; Nothing to write home about .
Bed003_234	So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go ; and what they 've said previously and whatnot . ; And then we have the means that they should use . ; Right ?
Bro010_329	They p they looked ahead a little bit . ; A little bit . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_295	right . ; Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth . ; So . ; Hhh . OK .
Bns003_244	And to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism , that the packets can be used to set up the routes because they have all the information . ; They know where they have to go because IP addresses are still there and within the packet . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; I mean , how can this use , uh , within this area , and how this area is then aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself .
Bmr019_1214	And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were . ; Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps . ; So , you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech . ; Right .
Bmr028_1465	Yeah . ; I mean , another is what Liz was talking about , how in the Switchboard tests in all the Switchboard tests we 've been g doing , we 've been making the same er uh , same uh , uh , standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on . ; Which means that we weren't actually running it on on , uh , on data that had had no speech . ; And , in a sense , that was cheating .
Bro023_940	But you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , right ? ; When you add the negative to the positive value ; which is the true estimate . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2295	but ; So I I ; And and not within a not within a big room . ; Just , uh .
Bed002_119	and we don't want people to be editing what they say . ; Right . ; Right . ; So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft .
Bro028_657	I did , ; but Joe said , you know , " what you 're saying makes sense ; Uh - huh . ; and I don't know " .
Bed011_910	Huh ? ; this is the part that needs the work . ; Right . ; Yeah , so
Bro027_956	because I expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the ; Mm - hmm . ; So , was the training set same as the p the February proposal ? ; OK .
Bmr007_1199	I I couldn't decide . which was the right way to do it . ; Ah , yeah . ; Beep is good auditorily , ; if someone is listening to it , there 's no mistake that it 's been beeped out ,
Bed002_538	That 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that . ; You know ? ; But um , ; still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure ,
Bed011_1093	and I mean two or three that follow each other , ; Mm - hmm . ; so , where we can also sort of , once we have everything up and running , show the tremendous , insane inferencing capabilities of our system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_446	So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally ; Yeah . ; I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . ; So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode ,
Bed002_520	OK . ; But that doesn't necessarily ; But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ? ; Well Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ?
Bro023_347	OK , ; Errors , right , I don't have . ; cuz then you can figure out the percentages . ; It 's all accuracies .
Bmr020_663	It wouldn't matter ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's w That 's what I do .
Bed003_1147	Yeah . ; So but , e he doesn't use it . ; So in what sense has he updated it ? ; Well th you can either you ca or you can read both .
Bro016_391	Uh , ; y yeah . Basically we we 've stopped , uh , experimenting , ; Yes ? ; I mean . We 're just writing some kind of technical report .
Bro027_999	I see . ; but it was marginally better with this configuration . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr030_315	It sounded like a URL , the way you were saying it , ; Oh . Oh . ; yeah . ; Sorry .
Bmr007_1231	Yeah . ; Yeah , I agree . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro021_822	Mm - hmm . ; first place , I mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries , uh , this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things . ; I mean , how much is the poor you know , relatively , uh , unhelpful result that you 're getting in this or this or this ; is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks
Bro023_760	but I don't have the results for all the cases with that . ; So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , ; which is like , everywhere I use the channel zero VAD . ; And that seems to be the best combination , uh , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel .
Bed013_1220	Like , what they want ; either , the information that they want , or ; It 's always information that they want probably , of some kind . ; Right ?
Bro018_1105	the Aurora setup of HDK training on clean TI - digits , ; and um it it helped ; um in a phony reverberation case ; um where I just used the simulated impulse response um the error rate went from something like eighty it was from something like eighteen percent to um four percent .
Bed011_189	and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing . ; You get involved in that process too . ; And um And for now uh the the question is " How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? " ; So Um , one could sort of think of
Bed013_660	It 's time to walk the sheep ? ; No . ; It 's a a uh presumably one of the Watergate codes they uh ; Oh .
Bmr003_1458	What do you mean by du ; I sort of thought that this is not gonna be easily processed anyway ; and maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " . ; Yeah .
Bro026_288	There 's a question about exactly how we do it . ; We probably will go to something better later , ; Mm - hmm . ; but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently ,
Bns001_1450	Hmm - hmm . ; Because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing . ; I believe the same applies for Multicast . ; And I believe the same applies for routing .
Bmr001_638	and this is a pretty tiny amount of data . ; Mm - hmm . ; So maybe we should do another number list and ; Well right I I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page .
Bmr007_293	Uh - huh . ; Let 's say that in in second fifty - seven of one minute , you start talking and I start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . ; Yep . ; OK .
Bmr003_2255	Ain't science wonderful ? ; Wow . ; That 's amazing . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_104	Yeah . ; So , it 's actually conceivable to do use the full training set . ; Yeah , but we also have to do this other processing , so having a smaller training set , ; if it 's only a few percent difference , it might be be worth doing it .
Bmr019_499	There 's , um You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized . ; Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking ; and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping ; and just front - end those pieces .
Bmr010_28	No , why don't we talk about practical things ? ; OK . ; Sure . ; Well , um , I can give you an update on the transcription effort .
Bmr028_483	He 's right there . Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Very helpful . ; Yeah , I didn't actually see who they all were .
Btr002_1164	Ready . ; I just have no preference . ; Well , that 's lovely . ; Yeah , it doesn't really matter .
Bed017_330	Yeah . So , um , ; you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together ; and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some Pareto optimal uh , uh , thing for ; That 's good .
Bmr013_764	So I didn't know in the group you had if you had ; Yeah . ; so you have the networks meeting ? ; Yep , we do .
Btr002_1028	I see . ; Oh ! ; Yeah , I do that all the time . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_952	Yeah . ; Oh , you m y totally unadapted . ; Just do or a free ri ; Yeah .
Bed006_1368	I 'm not sure if I understand your question . ; Only one of those things are gonna be lit up when we pass this on . ; OK . ; So only Enter will be
Bro016_32	Do you think that would be the case for next week also ? ; Or is is , uh ? ; What 's your projection on ? ; Um .
Bro012_1289	And then that would be ; Yeah , well , I was not thinking this ; yeah , this could be an ; yeah
Bmr019_1887	I don't know . ; I don't know . ; Um ; This is You know , this is a different kind of speech ,
Bmr006_986	Yeah . ; OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . ; That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_190	I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this . ; Yeah . ; I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy . ; Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway .
Bro014_1122	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I guess that makes sense .
Bro018_251	Yeah . ; OK . ; But even i in ; Oh yeah , in training .
Bro008_178	but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out . ; Hmm . ; Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether . ; When is the development set I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ?
Bed003_273	Yeah , ; that one needs a lot of ; And are those mutually exclusive sets ? ; Not at all .
Bed006_1786	" OK " . ; Um are the are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago ; like the things ; maybe maybe you 're gonna run a trial tomorrow .
Bro028_790	Yeah . ; Um ; Mm - hmm . ; So if he 'll
Bmr015_375	But they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So , uh , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual ,
Bmr028_144	Right ? ; Uh , no . It doesn't have to , ; but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it . ; Oh , wow .
Bmr003_948	Right . ; OK . ; Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones . ; Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature .
Bsr001_642	Worse acoustics . ; Yeah . ; An - and then , you know , there is , all all these issues about processing all this information , you know , transcription , ; Mmm .
Bmr022_473	Yeah , it was forty - five minutes . ; That 's the shortest meeting we have . ; Most of them are double that , or ; Yep .
Bed014_1170	Mm - hmm . ; W do you have data , like the the You have preliminary data ? ; Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence ; and I 'm sure you guys have uh , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at the rest of it
Bed012_179	You 're gonna say y you 're gonna say , g " Go down that way . " ; You 're not gonna say " It 's It 's five hundred yards away from you " or " It 's north of you " , or " it 's located " ; Well , I mean But the there 's So you just have three decisions for the final node , that would link thes these three nodes in the net together . ; Um .
Bed012_143	we want to know , um , is Does he want info ? ; o on this ? ; or know the location ? ; Or does he want to go there ?
Bed014_905	OK . It was th off this week , ; Yeah . I always thought it was staying . ; yeah . ; Right .
Bsr001_2264	Mm - mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But these these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and and wanting to coordinate you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened . ; Hmm .
Bed010_574	OK . ; So , i i i is German uh closer to to E uh , uh , uh , uh to E I mean uh ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't think it it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different .
Btr002_455	see if I can do it just by itself , ; but it it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque , ; and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance ; or you go to the mixed channel ,
Bro021_1351	No , it 's interesting . ; Uh , w we haven't had anybody work with it before , ; so it 's interesting to get your get your feedback about it . ; It 's another type of approximation because i because it 's a statistic statistic approximation to remove the noise .
Bmr010_728	And , um , ; they were they were perturbed with me ; because I was breathing in instead of breathing out . ; And they had models for they they had Markov models for br breathing out
Bro005_379	So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; I wonder why
Bro003_1398	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; but n ; yes ,
Bro011_358	Mm - hmm . ; So how did he combine all these features ? ; What what r mmm classifier did he ; Hmm .
Btr002_1554	Now I know what you 're talking about . ; Yeah . ; That 's kind of interesting , though . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1045	they felt they wanted to set a limit . ; So they chose sixty . ; Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters ; and and that bothered some other people .
Bmr031_340	Well , again the hope is that , uh I mean , it 's it 's looking I mean , I have to ask these folks ; but , uh , my impression is that the , um , IBM path is looking , you know , more promising . ; Yep . ; It it pretty good .
Bns002_553	so you know that the amount of time you have to wait until you can try to get the control , or t try to send your own transmission . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , ; but this scenario is also nov uh , only working if um both or all nodes have the same range of transmission .
Bed015_962	OK . ; Hmm . ; But , um , ; OK .
Bmr024_1090	OK . ; My intention is to do a script that 'll do everything . ; I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? ; No .
Bed006_1771	Hmm . ; Who doesn't like to be a ; Everybody likes action . ; Oh .
Bmr014_1096	OK . ; Alright , so I think ; Yeah so if we have if i ; Again let 's you know , sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right ,
Bro026_274	I guess we sort of uh , ; There 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for V A ; So , I mean , in ; I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff .
Bmr012_462	because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech . ; It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech ; So . ; Oh yeah .
Bed012_619	right ? ; Is she ? ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1442	So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space ; but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else . ; Uh - huh . ; And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not .
Bmr008_404	You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says has a big " Optional " right next to it ? ; Yeah . ; You know people who lie about it ? ; Oh yeah .
Bed005_81	um ; I The last paragraph " if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . " ; OK ? ; Now that , we had to be included for this other one
Bmr022_794	But ; the other stuff is just gonna some variability we 're gonna have to accept . ; It 's I I understand , ; that 's fine with me .
Bns001_576	Because if not , well , they can say , " Oh , you are doing the same thing . " ; " This was done now . " ; Or maybe talk to them about s operations they thought of but didn't touch yet . ; Yeah , well we are close .
Bmr020_694	Well this isn't ; He still has his Unix account here , you know . ; He does ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_303	Right . ; It didn't look like a sequence of phones ; Right . ; it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here .
Bmr005_483	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And I I found that eh another thing . ; When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file ,
Bmr005_1260	and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM ; right ? ; Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was ; Do Oh , do we now ?
Bns002_490	but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node . ; Yeah . ; That 's it . ; So when this node hears the CTS transmission that is performed by the receiver , this will be uh informed , that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it 's area .
Bed015_951	Mm - hmm . ; Well , so that 's why I was saying how ; since I couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot ; Right .
Btr001_2467	Right . ; Yes . ; And people are just hysterical ; and they 're like , " What were we talking about ?
Bmr019_835	So I so for for one of the N S A groups . ; Mm - hmm . ; And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . ; So I think you do have
Bed009_263	I s I see questions on peoples ' faces , ; so why don't ; let 's let 's Let 's hear ; Oh
Bro017_224	and then perhaps uh one could try to find a a all - pole model to such a spectrum . ; Because a all - pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . ; That 's what we want to try . ; I have a visitor from Brno .
Bed002_1089	So , uh , ; There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed , ; Right . ; It 's OK .
Bmr028_501	There were other people also . ; We 're talking about those ? ; There were other c other people also who didn't ha fill out the speaker forms , in addition to the N S ; I i in in other meetings .
Bns002_1065	but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through , put it in the I P header . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , and , ; this one is going then to this guy and so on and so on ,
Bro024_1541	And it seems that right now this this is c a constant that does not depend on on anything that you can learn from the utterance . ; It 's just a constant noise addition . ; Um . ; And I I think w w
Bmr015_388	They have three size grants . ; This one there 's , ; um ; See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years
Bmr006_958	Um , but ; Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine . ; Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if ; Yeah .
Bro008_246	and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . ; So , ; um , uh , that 's one one aspect of it . ; And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering Uh ,
Bed005_1022	Approach . ; OK . Right . ; Right . ; So , I mean , we 'd like to take all these various cues , right ?
Btr002_432	" Fff " . you know , you 'll ; di uh , or interl interdental , " fff " . ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to " mmm " , you know .
Bmr021_609	Yeah , it 's not gonna ; I mean , if we ; I assume you 're not gonna go , like , into , you know , my directories and change my file names . ; Right .
Bmr024_1311	Hmm . ; Uh , in this case four . ; Um , which Eh , we used to do only three , ; and then we found out we can squeeze
Bro023_463	so , ; uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it ; but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , uh , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1677	But , ; yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet . ; So we have to figure out the neural nets , I guess . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1144	And the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l We 'll have to l ; It 's also ; That should be ay We should be able to look at that ; No ,
Bns003_840	but oder ? ; Yeah , then , what is the current status anyway ? ; Um , I 'm currently I 'm looking into Quality of Service Routing , ; this is .
Bsr001_1323	" Computer , show me a web page on X , " return . ; Yeah . ; It is exactly these things that I mentioned . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1885	Maybe those ? ; They 're so ; I don't know . ; I don't know .
Bmr008_1583	So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting ; which I think actually is good , the more I think of it , ; that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that . ; I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it it 's it it may not be normalized enough .
Btr001_638	Hmm . ; oh , yeah , ; yeah , that 's possible . ; Hmm .
Bed013_274	J J Jer - Jerj ; Jerry Feldman . ; Oh , yeah . That 's the guy . ; We we we we g
Bed002_1094	Right . ; So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with . ; And it 's available Matlab code . ; Nancy knows him well .
Bmr027_1306	Yeah . ; Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate ; So . ; and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out .
Buw001_246	and no one ever did . ; Mm - hmm . ; I didn't follow up either . ; So I didn't track them down and say " please do th do it now " .
Bns001_1396	OK ? ; A lot more expensive , ; but that 's OK , ; I have the funding
Bmr007_548	I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where I mean , this is called " precision timing " in conversation analysis , where they come in overlapping , but at a point where the information is mostly complete . ; So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_607	Right . ; And so what happens is that this uh , add additional variability to this envelope ; and um ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1691	Oh . Yeah , right . ; Yeah . ; The fa ; " Please throw everything in that direction . "
Bed002_471	So , where would we extract that information from ? ; From the M - three - L ? ; No . ; No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th
Bed012_79	So we get After we are done , through the Situation we get the User Vector . ; So , this is a ; So this is just a specification of all the possible inputs ? ; Yep .
Bed016_1178	For some reason when you said " feedback electronically " I thought of that ; you ever see the Simpsons where they 're like the family 's got the buzzers ; and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ? ; Yeah . That 's the first one , I think .
Bed013_354	Well ; And since Jerry 's coming back , we can run it by him too . ; So . ; Yep .
Bmr005_721	Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise . ; And ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_1594	Oh . No . I just mean I just mean that it 's that that his ; Depends on how much work they did . ; Or ? ; Oh .
Bro012_686	Yeah . ; Some good reverb . ; No , I mean , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant , ; but I mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really .
Bed003_351	for one of those . ; And then in that second row or whatever that row of Time of Day through that So all of those Some of them come from the utterance ; and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things . ; Right ?
Btr002_2202	and he says ; uh , and then she then she said something ; and he says , " Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . " ; Oh wow .
Bro010_452	yeah , I 'm sorry , ; I don't don't know the answer ; but we should find out . ; I 'm sure we 'll find out soon
Bmr030_150	Oh , so what do you have to do ? ; Hmm . ; You have olt Alt Tab and ; Hold down at hold down Alt ,
Bmr010_1368	Cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as a as a as a as a p putative split point between speakers . ; Yeah . ; But if you included , uh , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases . ; OK .
Buw001_2242	so I 'm gonna pass for the moment ; but y come come back to me . ; For the moment . ; Pass .
Bro027_1607	OK . ; So that delay , plus the LDA . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning , plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output .
Bmr013_538	Might ; Interesting idea . ; To to I mean , you 'd wanna iterate , somehow . ; Yeah .
Bed009_87	but I may not have time to get in . ; the the ultimate goal is that before they leave we we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things . ; And um and by virtue of doing that then in this case Johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it . ; Ad infinitum .
Bmr012_405	and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one ; so there was @ @ so that 's great . ; Yeah . ; Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop
Bed006_265	the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects . ; And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that " ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here " ; and " I wanted to maybe take a picture of that " ; and " maybe um eat here "
Bmr016_2243	So right now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the uh , the o original version ; and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ? ; Yeah . I 'm doing it myself . ; I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels ,
Bro017_1102	But . But uh . ; Huh ! ; Well that 's that 's a really i ; So . So . Yeah .
Bro022_144	Yeah . That 's why I I was asking about that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_191	That sounds really neat . ; and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff . ; Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that ; so I 'll work with him on it .
Bdb001_331	and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free , ; and ; I mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ? ; OK .
Btr001_1221	that 's the Tigerfish . ; Right . ; T ; Right ,
Bro005_1262	Trying to tune ; wha networks ? ; Yeah , I think so . ; I think they were also mainly ,
Bmr031_439	Well , the the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ? ; My feeling is no , it doesn't . ; Your audio , u these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that . ; But I just wanted to double check with other people before I told them " yeah , no problem " .
Bmr014_385	And you know , so how you could ; Nine two , ; e Exactly . ; right .
Btr002_1890	I had one where they were just they were just , like , talking about each word , you know , ; and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again , ; and just the q the quotes around the word were driving me crazy . When they kn knowing ; when to put the quotes and when
Buw001_2154	You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , ; but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . ; OK . ; But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields .
Bed015_916	" John is on the bus " versus " John is on the train . " ; Right . ; And " John is on the bus " versus " was " , and e ; Is on .
Bed008_1480	Yep . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_390	Yeah , and u I think it would I Actually , I thi I like that . ; yeah . ; And when they transcribe this meeting it 's gonna be really impossible . ; I think it would
Bed006_325	Which I 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t ; But , thanks to Fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that . ; Questions ? ; Comments on that ?
Bmr022_137	Uh ; Yeah . ; That I mean , just naming schemes will get ; We can definitely do that .
Bmr005_1339	That 's important . ; Yeah , ; So it 's a great idea , ; I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .
Bmr019_1679	and go back and fix them . ; Yeah . ; But ; Tha - There are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh , these ca Not a lot , but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker
Bro026_825	uh . ; We can For September , we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently . ; And then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . ; Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ?
Bmr009_309	There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way . ; But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have have some uh some hope ; Yeah . ; Well , especially for normalizing .
Bro018_875	And , so there 's no place where these where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that I can go look at and compare to the PLP ones , ; so whereas with our features , he 's actually storing the cepstrum on disk , and he reads those in . ; Right . ; But it looked like he had to give it uh
Bro021_632	um , ; um , ; you know , there might be some numerical issues . ; We don't really know that .
Bro021_199	well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two . ; Hmm . ; Um . ; And Yeah .
Btr002_2934	Hmm ! ; It 's only been like twice . ; It 's true . That 's very rare . ; It 's rare .
Bsr001_1214	so . ; We we talked about that and It was ; Is that ; And according to Morgan it 's like happening
Bmr024_298	Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . ; You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips .
Bro021_275	Yeah . ; or or twelve . ; Yeah . Right . ; So what was the what was the threshold part of it ?
Bed005_397	That function automatically generates an initialized XML structure ? ; I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a a l a field to it , or something . ; I ; y
Bmr024_286	Well , I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , ; and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , ; and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? ; And so I 've uh , I , uh , uh , I 've trained the new one uh , the new the newest one , to , um , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time .
Bed006_1680	That 's wonderful . ; Yeah . ; So it 's gen it 's general across all of these things ; it 's like I mean Shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process .
Btr001_1318	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; The ones that say " IBM " are like They actually say " IBM " .
Bro022_1043	And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . ; So there are three time constants that I have . ; So , I 'm just playing around . ; So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping ,
Bmr014_465	How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? ; It would be separate ; The letters would be separated in space ; OK .
Bmr005_42	So uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around ; and and uh sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things . ; Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , ; we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events "
Bed010_284	because ; e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . ; And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . ; And so it 's
Bro017_991	So it 's ; just tuning the models and testing , actually . ; Yeah . ; recognitions .
Bro024_1632	this smoothing , it was over the subtraction factor , so to say . ; It 's a smoothing over the the gain of the subtraction algorithm . ; Was this done ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_198	No . ; So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is . ; The output . ; So what decisions does this make ?
Bro013_406	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Both should have sixty - five because ; Yeah .
Buw001_1927	Yep . ; Right . ; I mean , that that 's ; Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like search .
Bed006_1339	Like , I mean uh do you When do you need ; Damn this headset ! ; When you this uh , ; Metacomment .
Bns003_721	and so ? ; So ; we have , uh , other students are which are , uh , mmm people that has a grant ; and they are they are starting as , uh , researchers ,
Bmr021_606	Yeah . Yeah . I mean , it 's only gonna affect my work . ; right ? ; So . ; Yeah , it 's not gonna
Bmr022_721	Yeah . OK . ; And and Brian actually forwarded me in advance . ; He he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to . ; Which is which is really a good a good way to do it .
Bmr003_1258	Right . ; We 'd like to . ; Well ; Unfortunately
Bns003_783	But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management ; and this will happened , I believe , in December , ; maybe , and in the beginning of January . ; and I will keep informed to the management of ICSI anyway ,
Buw001_379	but we have zero hours of of of queries . ; So he 's just sort of going " where where do I where do I start ? " ; w ; Well , th you could do
Bmr021_942	And that that 's quick to do . ; So . ; I was thinking about tandem system ; Well , let 's not talk about it here ,
Bed006_43	and um they 're engaged in in various activities , some of which you will hear about today . ; Ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance ; and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type , ; Oh wow .
Bmr008_1453	Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it . ; I I 'm wo ; but but ; Exactly .
Bed016_979	Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree . ; I 'm con ; you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using " Plato , " ; Yeah .
Bed015_1045	So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in . ; But the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender , ; um ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary ; but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth
Buw001_1034	fff ! ; So , ; Hmm . ; you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this .
Bmr007_1132	Uh I did have this other agenda item which is , uh @ @ it 's uh a list which I sent to uh a couple folks , but um I wanted to get broader input on it , ; So this is the things that I think we did in the last three months ; obviously not everything we did but but sort of highlights that I can can tell s some outside person , you know , what what were you actually working on . ; Um in no particular order uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from from , uh three months ago .
Btr002_3146	Mm - hmm . ; you know , I I usually only use them when I I know that , um , the person was trying to make a word . ; I mean , I know that the the word they were trying to say ; and that they were stuttering that ,
Bro004_1074	Mmm . ; set . ; So that 's a good question . ; Where does it come from ?
Btr001_741	I don't have so much problem at the beginning , ; but . ; Of breath or of uh nothing ? ; No , of n just nothing .
Bmr011_1565	Yeah . Different varieties of English . ; Ooo , ooo . ; Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that ; Native speaking . Native speaking English .
Bmr019_1073	and we don't know what people are doing . ; Try to create a paper out of that . ; Yeah . I mean , y y you folks have probably already told me , ; but were were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission ,
Bro024_1374	so the VAD was trained on maybe different set of labels for channel zero and channel one ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2150	body language , ; Right . ; gesture , ; whatever .
Bmr029_639	Yeah . ; I could do that . ; Right . ; OK . So I guess I just need to get Don to , uh
Bro023_31	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No , he 'll be around for three weeks .
Bed010_203	And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well . ; Right . ; So I mean , the the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been sort of been geared towards this demo , ; Yeah .
Bro010_148	is that , um , basically the way on - line normalization was done uh , is just using this recursion on on the um , um , on the feature stream , ; Yeah . ; and but this is a filter , ; so it has also a delay .
Bmr031_863	I it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber , to them finishing transcription , to then being checked , ; you know , with a double - check . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , when we say the total transcribed , that 's the one that 's gone through being checked , I believe .
Bmr001_408	That 's forty minutes ; Right . ; So , six gigabytes . ; But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels .
Bro012_932	OK . ; but does this have the voice activity detection in it ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns003_183	Das wird geaendert . ; And , um ; But , um ; I think everybody should take a look to the web pages , and inform Claudia if something , uh , has to be improved or if there 's some comments
Bmr024_669	I think it 's I I think I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key . ; Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . ; Nnn , well ; Yeah .
Bmr026_42	So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process . ; Oh . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_557	It 's a human operator . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times .
Btr002_1791	Right . Right . ; What is that ? ; It 's not a beep . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1057	But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction . ; We were doing our funny stuff , right ? ; We were doing multi multi uh , multi - stream and and so forth . ; Yeah .
Bed012_102	that 's yeah , use oh , uh Yeah , OK . ; So so we get this whole list of of , um , things , ; and the question is what to do with it , ; what to hand on ,
Bro008_351	So , probably if we only take the close microphones , I guess the results should be much much better than this . ; I see . ; Mmm . ; Oh , OK ,
Bmr009_1447	OK . ; Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do , ; the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are . ; That 's right .
Bmr028_1170	So , um . We haven't tried that yet on the meetings , ; uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too . ; I wanna ask , um So , you know that the data I ' v I have upgraded it considerably . ; So I 've probably made I probably corrected something like ,
Bro025_83	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Uh , and so , uh , th the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much . ; Uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much .
Bmr018_1521	Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it . ; So that 's what they used as training data . ; Yeah . ; It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct .
Bro022_1137	I don't ; this is ; I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain . ; The other thing is
Bmr030_628	They 're the beep files . ; Yeah , it 's a p hundred meg . ; They 're the beep files . ; That 's right .
Bro027_635	Is two hundred the d ; The hundred milla ; mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . ; It could be eighty
Bdb001_1351	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours , ; and use that .
Bmr026_514	I s I sent this out a a day ago ; And put it where ? ; Right . ; but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works .
Bro019_357	I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . ; What I did was I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech ,
Bed015_911	So that 's focuses on John . ; Right . ; " John is on the bus and not on the train . " ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_290	even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . ; Right . ; I 'm gonna do something . ; I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization .
Bns001_1576	And and ; if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the eh institutions and ; Mm - hmm . ; N Not only this .
Bmr003_1320	French . ; Yeah . ; their academic . ; And they 're they 've been quite responsive .
Bmr003_989	and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . ; So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID . ; If that 's clear . ; It 's pretty cute .
Bed015_665	but we might not need a notation for it ? ; We don't have a notation for it ; but we might want one . ; So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item " walk " ,
Bmr020_1636	Oh , I 'd be delighted with that , ; I I was very impressed with the with the result . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting ,
Bmr018_1655	Cost . ; Yeah . ; There 's just plain cost , ; That 's a big one .
Bmr023_773	Uh - huh . ; But , you know , it didn't change th the ; by adjusting that the , um ; OK .
Bed003_1349	you have to have some notion of not just ; I mean there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse ; Right . ; so I don't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen .
Bmr010_1324	and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . ; Hmm . ; And let the , uh , uh , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data . ; I I , um ,
Bmr010_1036	Where were they when we needed them ? ; I think ; We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything . ; And I 'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool .
Bmr010_520	Wouldn't it ? ; Yeah . ; Um . I I don't know . ; I just it 'd be
Bro016_1168	as these detectors are are , uh , developing . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; So , he looks at interesting interesting things in in the different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out .
Bmr003_283	which we may wanna make a little more formal . ; So . ; And the other thing is that , um , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , ; Right .
Bmr010_1088	Calendar year ; or ? ; Uh , I mean , calendar year two thousand one . ; OK .
Bro023_1579	Mmm . ; But are you comparing with something ; e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again , ; i it
Bro023_625	Mm - hmm . ; And then you ; Do you assume the noise is the same ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1224	basically . His ; Y who Yeah , right . ; Whose result ? ; Bush 's .
Bro027_1152	Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . Of TIMIT . ; Because in the TIMIT it was zero to some clean . ; Right . ; Yes .
Bed008_334	What why ? ; Like they 're either true or false ; The prosody ? ; and they uh
Bmr011_604	But , e I think for ; I mean , how we 're gonna decide ; For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that . ; I mean , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can
Bed015_1219	Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; some of these other ones ,
Bed016_647	But Like , " run into an old friend " , it probably needs its own construction . ; I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; and maybe it is ,
Bmr016_1097	Jane ? ; OK . So I got a little print - out here . ; So three on this side , ; three on this side .
Bmr028_63	And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format . ; Oh , good . That 's very good . OK . ; Yeah . So my my decision was , for the first pass for this demo that Liz was talking about I decided that I would do , um , only enough to get it working , as opposed to any coding . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_606	Yeah . ; and it 's It 's harder later on , i I It 's easier for the person ; I see . ; There is another problem .
Bmr014_356	so we probably now have about thirty - five hours . ; And and that 's that 's uh ; How much of that is digits ? ; It 's uh
Bmr018_1661	if you uh ; one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred , ; and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter , ; that 's that 's gonna be better .
Bro011_249	he he it it wasn't really fleshed out ; and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation ; but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use ; so I have to I have to read it more ,
Bdb001_562	uh , like these P - files or anything like that . ; And that 's sort of the world of things that I ; And then we have the aligned channels , of course , ; Right .
Bmr009_343	I had the same intuition last last last week . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Just seems sort of complex .
Bmr031_790	R r ; I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well . ; But the University of Hawaii has issued a request . ; Yep .
Bmr001_829	Yeah . ; Not in Scotland . ; Inexpensive . ; I 'm sorry , yeah .
Bmr015_1199	Yeah , well , see and that 's what I wouldn't know . ; that ; And we don't either . ; I mean so so the thing is it 's it
Bmr005_106	Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , ; so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours ; Mm - hmm . ; and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have
Bmr008_89	Sitting . ; Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession . ; That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down " speech researcher " or or something at that granularity . ; oh .
Bsr001_2209	and you can get time , student time , to clean up the corpus and things . ; Hmm . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1046	But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way . ; You get in trouble and you know et cetera ; Mmm . ; and so s
Bmr026_828	I I think so . ; Yeah . ; Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower ; and so if
Bro021_1145	how h ; how much in in the work they reported , how much noisy speech did you need to get , uh , good enough statistics ; for the to get this mapping ? ; I don't know exactly .
Bmr022_1238	Yeah ; Yeah . ; And if we don't let them modify their own data , they 're not gonna store their data in our repository . ; Or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data .
Bmr013_990	Not not the , bodypack , ; just the lapel . ; Just the lapel itself . ; Um , and then one of the one of those .
Bed006_849	Hmm ? ; OK , go it . ; Uh - huh . ; and then what actual a action is chosen is will be in the in the action schema section .
Bed009_651	It 's tricky because one could well imagine ; I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants . ; One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user . ; You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something .
Bed012_905	Or , if even something Chinese , for example . ; Or , something in Mandarin , yeah . ; Or Cantonese , as the case may be . ; What do you think about that , Bhaskara ?
Bed008_1258	The what decision ? ; ROVER . ; All of their outputs combined to make a decision . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_1007	Yeah . ; Can I ask ? ; It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . ; S
Bdb001_460	So what What NIST would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like " link start equals , um , you know , some node ID , ; Yeah . ; So ; end equals some other node ID " ,
Bed015_1138	In reality ; or in ; Semantically . ; semantically , yeah . Yeah .
Bed004_682	So that 's ; but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through . ; Right . ; It 's you know , it 's great is is , you know , as one step toward uh toward where we wanna go .
Bmr006_1859	Yeah , we we we already missed the party . ; So . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed005_358	This is where it takes its own , um , syntax , ; and converts it somehow . ; Um . ; Where is the uh
Bmr007_995	Or ; Yeah . ; and I haven't spent a lot of time on it and I 'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it . ; OK .
Bro008_190	this Tuesday , ; yeah . ; And , uh , ; they , uh
Bro014_1373	for that ? ; This is the signal . ; I see that . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr007_193	And and , als ; I mean , I can't say universally , ; but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , um now , uh don't . ; I mean they they also you know , uh uh , ack acknowledge the influence of sub of subcultural norms and cross - cultural norms and things .
Bro024_958	did ; cu if you add noise to one of the parameters , you widen the distributions ; Hmm . ; Becomes flat .
Bmr019_860	if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags , ; Right . ; which is what I assume . ; Isn't that what what you ?
Bro004_613	OK ; so these are not ; OK , ; alright , I see .
Bro028_1103	Right ? ; And , um and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of some sort of pattern . ; Right ? ; And it could be , like like these , um these auditory patterns that Michael is looking at .
Bro021_841	I don't know . ; The methods ; If you want , you c I can say something about the method . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_193	Right . ; But ; Yeah . ; Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be
Bmr003_1107	Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co Something like that . ; They all just said transcription . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Well , the the way it worked is it it was scaled .
Bmr015_138	yeah . ; Yeah . ; It it 's kinda nice ; Mmm .
Bmr022_425	Othe - other than lengthening the transcript , I think it would be very helpful . ; Just instead of the sequential number , for ; perhaps just the speaker ID or something . ; Just say speaker one or spea
Bmr028_1318	Well , it definitely helps with , um , forced alignment , too , ; One percent . ; because , you know , whe when we know the the the true words and we 're adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings , especially the like , the front - end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them , that is not represented in Switchboard or CallHome , then it then it really helps . ; Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are .
Bro026_479	It would have to fit ; but ; Yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_997	So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . ; And the reason I ask the question is , ; um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , ; uh , the fact that there was some
Bmr006_866	It 's pure si pure silence with the with the machine on the on the roof . ; Well ; w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . ; With the fan .
Bmr019_210	I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics . ; Mm - hmm . ; And another might be that , uh , I 'd I would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody ; did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they didn't include it ,
Bmr028_1709	Yeah . Sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together , ; and ; Right . Exactly . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed016_166	Just so you know . ; Yeah , ; But , anyway . ; um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d
Bmr003_1832	Dan 's sort of already started . ; We could have like business - to - business E - commerce as well ! ; That 's right . ; No , but I 'm
Bmr014_797	So far . ; So . ; In the meetings so far , yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr027_620	Alright . ; For all the reasons that we 've discussed . ; So we 'll we 'll see if we do or not . ; Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .
Bro003_404	And that way you can say , " Well , " you know , " we 're gonna build it for what we think are the most common ones " , ; but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , " here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . " ; Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't . ; There 's you know , there 's fifty or something ,
Bed008_614	well , OK , put em in ; but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually uh ; Well is ; Here this was one of my problems
Bed002_978	Go back . ; To v ; OK . ; to View it .
Bed003_230	The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , ; like " I 'm " the the abstract idea being " I am a tourist ; I want to go to this place . " ; Right ?
Bed009_1113	yep yep yep yep ; and about the situation about " Is it raining ? " ; I don't know . ; Whatever it is .
Bed011_1145	Sure , OK . ; And um m making me incapable of going to NAACL , for which I had funding . ; But . No , no Pittsburg this year . ; Hmm .
Bro026_844	Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context . ; OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify . ; And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . ; So she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from TIMIT ,
Bmr009_563	Yeah . ; That would be really great . ; So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_763	And the other one is , what about transcription ? ; Transcription is done in Munich . ; Are ? ; OK .
Bro025_325	So we I mean , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA ; So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD , ; because the LDA doesn't have any delay . ; So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , I mean , it 's like effectively reducing the delay .
Bed016_370	Right . ; But , you know , it would ; But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . ; I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works ,
Bro022_388	Mm - hmm . ; So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also , ; Mm - hmm . ; and
Bdb001_445	One of them is that it 's easy to parse . ; You don't need a full XML parser . ; It 's very easy to just write a Perl script to parse it . ; As long as uh each tag is on one line .
Bro023_1619	Yeah , for for sure I will . ; Yeah . ; I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction . ; OK .
Bmr028_1292	So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file , it will actually compare the words based on their time marks . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So therefore , you can ,
Bsr001_1366	So the ; and th ; That 'd be cool actually . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_196	Ca - can can we fast forward through this conversation ? ; So ; Oh , yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah ,
Bro019_1348	It was it was ; Yeah . ; I mean , he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_41	From last time I wanted to Uh The An iss uh one topic from last time . ; Right , ; s OK , so one item for an agenda is uh Jane has some uh uh some research to talk about , research issues . ; Um and Uh , Adam has some short research issues .
Buw001_1721	so we might as well just do it . ; Absolutely . ; Yeah . ; You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers .
Bmr006_1059	Because what we had before for for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . ; Yeah . ; So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . ; Yeah .
Bed009_917	it 's Morphix is not used on - line . ; s so the lexicon might be derived by Morphix ; What ? ; but What what 's happening on - line is just um um a a retrieval from the lexicon which would give all the stemming information
Bmr018_1156	I don't remember the number off hand . ; It 's one of the NSA 's . ; I sent email before the conference , before last week . ; Oh , OK .
Bdb001_954	Mmm . ; the right representation , ; then , i you know , I hope it won't ; We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready ,
Bed013_1383	Mm - hmm . ; And we can say , well , that 's all nonsense . A , ; A , uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse , B , ; B , don't ever occur really in discourse ,
Bro018_103	Um , ; Bec - because the result are a little bit better ; but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar . ; Yeah .
Bed005_433	Um well , we we 'll see , when we say , ; let 's test something , ; " Goodbye " , causes it to c to create basically an " Action Goodbye - End - Action " . ; Which is a means of telling the system to shut down .
Bro023_96	but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? ; And , um ; So I w bef before , um Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . ; In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .
Bed017_369	So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , ; uh , the the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . ; And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , ; and um , I just hope that you have some comments
Bmr008_1080	Yeah . ; We 'll be able to backtrack from email . ; I like that . ; I never thought of that as an identifier .
Bed014_719	you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , ; so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a uh , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering . ; You So you could you could you could invert invert the whole thing , so you s you tag that information on to the lexicon ; Mmm .
Bmr002_546	I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk , ; Mm - hmm . ; is that is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation . ; Right .
Bmr019_1625	um , ; but the other one that you did , ; the NSA one , ; which we hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it ,
Bmr010_1504	um , ; as with a lot of things , it is not uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds . ; And then there 's , you know Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it is it is it , uh , delta of those things ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_209	Before the twenty - ninth , ; OK . ; OK . ; That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea .
Bdb001_1298	Andreas was saying ; Yeah . ; what if they haven't notated with them , times ? ; Yeah .
Bmr018_541	but , you know , I mean , th in the ideal world ; What ? ; Yeah . ; No I I agree that 'd be nice .
Buw001_936	Yeah , I 'm not sure . ; I think it it it will again depend on Landay , ; and if he has a student who 's interested , ; and how much infrastructure we 'll need .
Bmr027_1010	Oh . ; I think they 're doing w ; didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts ; Oh . I see .
Bdb001_1007	and they 'll just be done sequentially . ; OK . ; So . ; So , I guess ,
Bed005_831	Yeah . ; Nancy , it looked like you were s ; Oh . it 's just that that the goals are g very different to cases ; So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain , actually ,
Bro028_838	so if it gets too low you don't don't do it . ; Hmm . ; And they they claimed very nice results , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_2131	We haven't sent anything to the list yet . ; Oh ! ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr008_1732	Yeah , something ; Different situation , and ; somethin something like that ; That 's true .
Bmr006_72	although I 'm not sure I can participate if I ; You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned ,
Btr002_484	I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly ; and I realize it 's not Jane , ; and I realize it 's not a female even , ; but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , I 'm supposed to transcribe it . "
Bed011_899	That was the wrong shortcut anyhow . ; And we think that 's it , interestingly enough , that um , you know , th ; or or or something very close to it is going to be uh going to be enough . ; And
Bed004_374	And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot . ; What 's " tourbook " ? ; Tourbook ? ; That would be , I don't know , the " landmark - iness " of things ,
Buw001_30	So are we recording now ? ; Is this ; Yeah . ; Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live .
Bed003_844	Or , if something ; It seems like it 's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it ; Mm - hmm . ; Or " not public " and " not a door " are equivalent things ,
Bmr031_483	Yeah . It 's four or five times . ; And it 's , ; Yeah . ; Depends what you save .
Bns001_1783	OK . ; at a certain time . ; And I try to motivate the people . ; That it 's free .
Bed016_1011	Um . ; Like what side were they on , ; or ? ; What ?
Bmr031_1155	Who was that ? ; No ; So anyway . So I 've been preparing for that . ; Not answering your calls , huh ?
Bmr024_389	And so , I I don't think it 'll be a problem . ; We 'll have to see , ; but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem . ; OK .
Bro018_918	Which filters ? ; um ; The filter bank which is created by integrating over F F T bins . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_309	That 's not the first question . ; Well , Well , I guess . ; OK . ; Do you So , do you
Bro014_1325	Um , ; Oops . ; The mean is different with it , ; because the the histogram for the the classifica
Bmr031_1001	They wer so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous . ; Right . ; Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's an extra step . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_264	This is a nice smooth one ; Oh , neat . ; and it really does a good job . ; And there 's something like a median filter in it ? or something ?
Bmr019_495	Cuz we extract the times from the near - field mike , ; but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike . ; Right . I understand that . ; I just meant that so you have three choices .
Bmr008_911	Mm - hmm . ; because there 'll be one form for each person . ; Sounds good . ; It 's very efficient .
Bed013_722	we would ; I I mailed around a little paper that I have ; OK . ; It would be like , this is the idea .
Bed008_833	we don't have the discourse model here yet . ; Much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here . ; Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth . ; Really .
Bsr001_2464	OK , ; I I just extracted exactly the same ones , ; yeah , I 've never looked over the TI - digits corpus , ; OK .
Bmr003_1366	and I said , well , maybe . ; Good . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_910	Well ; But how many constructions do could we possibly have nodes for ? ; In this system , or in r ; No , we .
Bed015_1043	Um , it should be either category or in or instance . ; Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . ; So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in . ; But the important things for grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender ,
Bed013_593	Why , for whatever reason , ; I don't know . ; Not including figures and such ? ; I don't know .
Buw001_523	so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII ; and not somebody ; you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . ; Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary
Bro003_1287	Is this sort of what what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ? ; Mmm . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro027_2021	Is that right ? ; Uh , I won't ; it 's probably four because of ; is it three ?
Bed003_369	Yeah , th ; OK . ; so one thing I I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the " admission fee " thing set up . ; So one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this ,
Bro014_958	Mm - hmm . ; But in in reality , it 's you know , there 's all of this this overlap and so forth , ; Oh , sorry . ; and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,
Btr002_3309	if it 's like a manner of speaking , in which case it 's a " QUAL " . ; But not in terms of replacing , like , this string of undecipherable fragments . ; So , ; Oh , right .
Bmr014_1060	Good . ; that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . ; But if you really think something is gonna ; And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias .
Bed009_945	Oh , I haven ; yeah ; that 's getting it from the lexicon is just fine . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro019_510	Yeah . ; and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Btr002_651	Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like in the case of something with clipping , ; But not helpful for speech . ; does it were you saying that , uh it it increases to or , expands to accommodate that ? ; Or ,
Bro028_1080	And , um , um , um ; And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , ; in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings ; and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , uh , energy and fre and frequency .
Bns001_1467	that would be great , ; but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial . ; But I think that 's pfff ! that 's years , you know . ; A long way , yeah .
Bed010_1120	Oh right ! ; Right right right ! ; That 's great ! ; so .
Btr002_78	Mm - hmm . ; or ; but they 're not usually that bad , I I don't think . ; Mm - mmm .
Bro027_1754	Go away ! " ; I mean , ; I mean , i ; Doesn't ?
Bed013_342	if you work on it ? ; I don't have a problem with us working on it though ? ; So . ; OK .
Bmr019_621	and also then to train the system . ; Right . ; Right . ; OK .
Bro027_850	cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative , ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Um
Bsr001_657	The PDA one is very , very ambitious . ; Yeah . ; And it 's also it 's depending on not only that ; Mmm .
Bmr016_6	Yeah . ; Interesting . ; Will you get the door , ; Hmm .
Bmr022_259	It would be much easier . ; That 's probably better , ; Yeah , you have like a sanity sanity check on them . ; yeah .
Bed002_373	So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . ; And , the the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . ; And we think it 's well - formed . ; So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .
Bsr001_2436	Yeah , ; it 's plenty bad . ; It 's plenty bad just with digits , ; Mmm .
Bro022_396	It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . ; Oh . ; So that was done already . ; So we were
Bed010_167	So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us ; we just need to really understand what 's there . ; Is there anything we can make use of ? ; Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ?
Bmr029_697	Because this method might estimate the mean badly , if it had to face long silence periods . ; But that does mean that I need as much I need twice as much disk space as the original set ; cuz I need while I 'm running it cuz I need to create this intermediate set , um , of these big files , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1296	Ah , OK . ; Yeah , OK . ; S ; We just We sort of thought , " yes , " y y I mean
Bed014_1266	OK . ; Wel - then t Hans . ; Has I haven't seen Hans Boas ? ; He 's been around .
Bns002_417	That 's ; Yeah ? ; And that 's what I mean . ; In the meantime , he c still can get some data here , where he try to get certain connectivity on the MAC layer .
Bro011_582	the four and five which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so they had sixteen . ; So that 's pretty close .
Bmr024_1154	Which I 'm sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So , I think that 's a good idea .
Bed011_321	Yeah . ; So um , I ; Although ; Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex .
Btr001_129	that right there . ; Oh . ; Oh . ; Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be
Bmr009_506	we should look at it more uh more finely , but uh uh I think that This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple . ; So uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , a a a as as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr016_1699	OK . ; OK anyways , sorry . ; There is th one ; " Try to stay on topic , Adam . "
Bns001_954	like , OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ? ; And if it 's not in there yet well , it could be a suggestion ; and then the hardware people will make it part u like the ETSI or whatever where U wherever UMTS is standardized they will d well , go for it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_356	And then those are somewhat related to the path , ; Mm - hmm . ; so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . ; Um , " Goal " .
Bmr006_306	Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . ; We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . ; So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . ; But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it .
Bmr007_397	Yeah . ; So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel , ; Yeah . ; even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .
Bmr028_395	Did you actually look through your transcripts ? ; Or you just approved them all . ; Uh Well ; I just approved all mine .
Bmr007_412	Right . ; We 're looking at it here . ; So that 's why it 's coming to us as new ; even though it may well be you know , if your if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering eh
Bed016_990	Mm - hmm . ; So , ; You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so , ; Hmm .
Bro027_476	What 's the latency ? ; Because ; um ; the the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds .
Bro016_452	or why didn't we do this , ; Uh . ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bro019_486	I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . ; OK . ; Uh . ; No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update .
Bro027_804	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; then you wou you would go ; So that 's sort of the best you could hope for .
Bmr001_384	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today , that that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came it sounded like it was something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample ; and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour , if you used all if you used all
Btr001_2567	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; I think ; I I found that 's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings ,
Bmr001_735	Mm - hmm . ; so we should try to do it internally , ; maybe ask ask Jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody ; Mm - hmm
Bed003_554	what 's the fastest way ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; correct .
Bmr018_342	w Well , the other problem is the breaths ; cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform . ; I 've I 've looked at the int uh , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel , ; and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice .
Bro022_373	but maybe in practice it is . ; Hmm . ; That 's something to think about . ; I don't know .
Bed016_1087	Right . ; So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build ; Uh - huh . ; Right .
Bmr025_584	Yeah . ; Oops . ; Um the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on ; Speaking of which .
Bmr007_646	But what what do you think about that ? ; So . ; Do you think that would be useful ? ; I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something .
Bed014_977	How about that ? ; I I could ; Next week . ; Well , we 're meeting Tuesday .
Bmr016_1267	so we have uh that 's prepended with a v a tag of " VOC " . ; Whew ! ; And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , ; and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization .
Bmr011_897	Yep , ; exactly . ; And and what they 're doing is ; Yep .
Bed014_1176	To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm mm - hmm . ; I just sort of said " alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , uh , major verb co uh , constructions out of the way first . " And I have not gotten them out of the way yet .
Bro005_543	if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale the streams . ; Right ? ; So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , ; which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances
Bmr019_1717	I will come back to home to Spain . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1059	Uh . ; Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load . ; So when you have a big meeting it c uh , especially on a slower machine , it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3445	OK . ; Sure . ; Oh . Right . ; I can go .
Bed011_346	Uh , now , I have looked at all the data , and it 's pre it 's actually at least to an amateur , quite redundant . ; That that it was it was very stylized , and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing . ; Yeah , Yeah . ; I um I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them .
Bmr013_191	Yeah . ; Um , ; After coffee . ; after coffee , you 're right .
Bro011_77	um Yeah I guess the the uh LDA filters they were doing do have ; um uh let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds ; so ; uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz .
Bed013_647	The idea that you and I already know about ? ; That you already told me ? ; Not that ; No , no , no .
Bmr010_1575	No . ; The demonstration by hand . Segmentation by hand I I I think is the fast experiment . ; Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_2625	So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air , ; Yes . ; and so you need to i inhale , ; Yes .
Bsr001_165	They want to do something serious with this research . ; They tend to clip . ; Hmm . ; That 's a nice user interface , Dan .
Bns002_532	OK , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's always true that only one node gets a media access , for one frame .
Bmr013_259	You know i you should . It should be such that if you , if you , uh , if you had o um , all of the features , determined that you that you were uh ch have chosen , that that would tell you , uh , in the steady - state case , uh , the phone . ; Yeah ; So , um . ; OK .
Bro005_1366	Uh - huh . ; And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . ; I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . ; And um , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models um , uh asynchrony in any way
Bmr008_1501	and so uh there could be voiced and non - voiced pieces during the overlap . ; Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ?
Bsr001_2265	Mm - hmm . ; But these these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and and wanting to coordinate you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened . ; Hmm . ; I don't know .
Bed017_657	It 's just around the corner . ; and ; OK , great . ; Hmm .
Btr002_3177	So I think for both of the reasons it 's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word - like way . ; So even if it 's " er " , or ; Right . ; I would keep " er " .
Bro026_758	So , just so that I understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , uh , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? ; Is that the idea ? ; I I I think yeah , I I guess something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_421	We 've never just trained on one lang ; Training on a single language , you mean , ; and testing on the other one ? ; Yeah .
Bns001_208	thanks . ; So , ; let 's switch to the proposal . ; I ask everybody whether read it in the meantime , and understand everything .
Bro018_646	That 's for classification , ; And you get that for each class , you get a zero or a one . ; right ? ; right .
Bro021_1014	And then we can , ; uh , ; you know ; N no ,
Bro017_86	you know ? ; Right . ; " so let 's deal with that " . ; So I don't see the problem .
Bro005_1314	I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . ; You know , da training targets and noises and so forth . ; Mmm . ; That 's sort of wide open .
Bns001_795	like the zip uh s zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit . ; That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management . ; Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets . ; It 's almost perfect .
Bed013_327	Maybe . ; Who knows . ; Maybe . ; OK .
Bmr024_872	Soon . ; I think I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . ; And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once . ; Well , we 're alright for now
Bmr001_104	That 's my group . ; So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them . ; This is these are things we will find out . ; That 'll be an issue .
Buw001_1683	Uh , so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? ; See , that 's a good question . ; Yeah . They they don't have a way . ; I thought so .
Bmr031_212	n you know , it 's just basically , ; uh uh ; You know , I I don't have to time to to do too much these days ; except what I 'm already doing .
Bro021_305	I see . ; So , yeah , it 's really , uh , white noise . ; I th ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_472	Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah , right . ; Right ? I mean , we 're using a fair number of filters in the filter bank ; and uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_372	So one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this , ; Uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , ; but you could see perhaps discus the " admission fee " going directly to the mode pointing at " Enter " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1150	Yeah , but the ; as we are asking , for example , when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life , we can go and say " well , we will we are happy with this UPS ground system . ; What we want w is two - day delivery service , or w twenty - four hours service , and we are willing to pay more or less for this service . ; Yeah , but it 's really happened also in the riot case , you know .
Bmr016_331	Yeah . ; for adaptation . ; No , I 'm serious , ; so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation ,
Bro013_143	This is a modest amount of data . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . I mean , ordinarily you would say " well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know "
Bns003_19	because I get , I would like to say , different signals from Siemens , ; I believe , in the meantime it 's a higher probability that I will return , ; but based on the pro uh , procedure to get a J - one visa and the IP six six it will be I would like to say , earliest stage will be end of January , ; so that means we have to get over six weeks
Bmr027_1026	which makes more sense syntactically as well . ; And these the parentheses were f from ; Then ; Oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain .
Bns001_192	This is responsible for uh , everybody 's responsible for his own , ; yeah . ; Yeah , but but what is planned is that I do something like a previous , you know , layout , and give everybody the , uh , opin uh , the possibility to the chance to put his content inside ; Sure .
Bro022_883	but it plus energy is sort of ; Yeah . ; it plus energy plus timing information is sort of ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1151	or , ; I mean , where you don't wanna sort of have to make a distinction between a pre - existing relationship , or ; Yeah , I m ; Well , realize , w this was the idea was that this would be meeting specific .
Bed013_1053	or " where is the zoo " , ; and specify um , what what we think the the output uh , observe , out i input nodes for our Bayes - nets for the sub sub - D , for the discourse bit , should be . ; So that And I will I will then come up with the ontology side uh , bits and pieces , ; so that we can say , OK we we always just look at this utterance .
Bns002_607	if you cannot hear me , I cannot hear you . ; But ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr007_648	Do you think that would be useful ? ; I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . ; I guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , ; but maybe that 's obvious ,
Bro027_1787	i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . ; Yeah . ; But ; So I might maybe look at ,
Bed005_520	Hmm . ; Interesting . ; It 's just going up , ; it 's not going back down .
Bmr029_206	So , ; Yeah , fo ; Yeah . ; need to be
Bro027_1171	Well , if the initial range of SNR is different , we the problem was already there before . ; And ; Yeah . ; Because
Bro022_296	It w i i it wouldn't affect things . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; No .
Bmr005_948	Right so there 's this this There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed . ; and ; That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . ; Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM .
Bro027_792	o o ; Or the best we can get . ; the best that we can get i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . ; Then you can go up to sixty - two percent error rate reduction , globally .
Bro021_506	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , wh are you gonna do digits ; Yeah , ; m
Bro016_140	I probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model . ; Mm - hmm . ; So maybe I can have that for next week when Hynek 's here . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2255	So , th it 's kind of like that . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful ,
Bed015_2151	Yeah , and that 's ; That 's ma maybe the the way the only way it works . ; Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . ; I we have a our local expert on P R
Bmr010_890	No ; Oh , it does ? ; So the so the the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone , ; um , that is for that .
Btr001_2206	I mean , " so " tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying . ; so . ; Or at least that 's what I found . ; What do you mean ?
Bmr001_263	but I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb . ; So I I still think it 's potentially interesting to do that . ; Hmm . ; Although we we 'll have to be uh a aware of this if we 're writing proposals about it , wherever , that there may well be reviewers who will say , " well everyone knows that you can't get anything out of it if it 's if it 's close " .
Bed008_1096	But is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry ; or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U and maybe a sub - O " O " for " ontology " um meta node ; I don't know . ; but it might just
Bmr009_1475	We uh We done ? ; Yep . ; Yeah , that 's good . ; OK .
Bmr023_849	um , ; What 's actually qu interesting is that with ; um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training , ; and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , uh , the N best lists ,
Bro005_762	Oh ! ; Yeah , yeah , yeah ! ; With " two " , with " on - line - two " . ; yeah .
Bed010_848	It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . ; So . It 's always been out of phase ; but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . ; So we 've talked about it ,
Bmr030_42	OK . ; And to do research on the meetings . ; Cool . ; Yeah , it was specifically on the meeting .
Bns001_572	It is just that that well , maybe we can we can take a look at oh maybe a more in - depth look at this project ; just to see if we are doing the same , or if we are doing something similar . ; It would be important for us to to highlight the differences . ; Yeah .
Bro023_207	I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway . ; And so you may may just want to think of it as a filter . ; But , uh , if you do that , then , um , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy , uh , you get thirty percent . ; And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing .
Bmr010_587	maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side . ; I could send Brian the , um the transcript . ; I know these are ; er , uh , I could send him that if it would be possible , or a good idea or not , to try to do a s forced alignment on what we 're on the way we 're encoding overlaps now .
Bmr027_898	How m ; Yeah . ; Like , there were three meetings this time , or so ; or how many ?
Bro007_325	So this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff . ; Yeah . ; And with the all the output of the combo . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1319	Mmm , no . ; You were using Gin perhaps , ; yeah ? ; No .
Bmr012_931	All the way around I 'd think . ; Uh but who knows ? ; Yeah ; Yeah .
Bmr007_649	I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something . ; I guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , ; but maybe that 's obvious , ; maybe everybody knew that ,
Bmr018_1171	Yeah , that 's the problem with the NSA speakers . ; oh , Darn ! ; The problem with those , they 're all German . ; And e and e and extremely hard to follow , like word - wise ,
Bmr007_851	I think so , yeah . ; Um So , at any rate , my next attempt , which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the uh , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates . ; Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks . ; All of which are definitely acoustic events .
Bro003_929	the Spanish , perhaps , ; Spanish . ; we will have . ; Oh yeah ,
Bed011_1000	Uh , this is Yes . ; but that 's a ; By the end of the summer , too . ; No .
Bmr026_210	and he sent me to one point six whatever library ; and so it works . ; Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_1115	and the value of that encodes the choice . ; Right . ; Right . ; So what I don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles
Bmr022_467	yeah . ; That was at least forty - five minutes , ; right ? ; Yeah . That 's right .
Bmr011_323	so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did ; now which is just , uh , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . ; This is good . Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file
Bro012_1288	So maybe that 's what you meant . ; And then that would be ; Yeah , well , I was not thinking this ; yeah , this could be an
Bmr015_229	So . I mean , this is something that Liz and I spoke about ; But ; and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her . ; I see .
Bro022_945	Right . ; So that 's always there . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr019_727	And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal . ; And the next turn was a lot of people saying " mixed " , ; like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " . ; And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times .
Bmr009_189	or what y you know , rather than the mean take some ; Yeah . ; But And so in in these he 's got that . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2451	Hmm ! ; I don't know about permission . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr024_494	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro005_773	No , " two " is bad . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good .
Bmr005_1295	And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . ; I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection . ; There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends , ; and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to ,
Bmr020_1020	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But are we talking about , I don't know , a tenth of a second ? ; a ?
Bed008_1468	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro011_521	Using TIMIT ? ; or using ; using TIMIT ; right , right .
Bmr015_295	some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , ; and . ; So , they 're very competitive , ; and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals ,
Bro019_552	The speech . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing
Bmr020_1593	OK . ; Whereas if they listen to it and there 's don't hear any speech I think they 'd probably just listen to it once . ; But ; Yeah .
Bmr010_497	uh ; and , uh , those if ; Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty twenty years ago , ; so they 're it 's the the techniques work pretty well .
Bro005_158	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; And first in the experiment - one I I do I I use different MLP , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_181	How much memory does he have ? ; I don't know , ; but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all . ; I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight .
Bro007_306	and yeah . ; and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence . ; So we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . ; I see .
Bmr018_300	Right , so so you 'll have to I ; It will miss them . ; It will miss most of the really short things . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr029_260	Um , ; if you were gonna cut down on the test set , I would suggest that . ; Well Maybe . ; But , I I mean , how long does it take for the test ?
Bro017_1297	right ? ; Or That 's ; Yeah . ; Well there are at least there are optimized version for their architecture .
Bed016_692	the thesis proposal , you got ; Well , ; We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . ; Well there actually
Bmr009_705	and um . ; Great . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed002_188	And I 'm going to leave the mike here ; but it 's n Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on ; so don't have them use this one . ; It 'll just be sitting here .
Btr002_1182	Huh . ; i Right . ; I don't know . ; Cuz I always use it .
Bmr020_331	Mm - hmm . ; you still have significant overlap . ; You know , it goes down from maybe For Switchboard it goes down from I don't know f um I don't know f fourteen percent of the words to maybe uh I don't know , eleven percent or something ; it 's it 's not a dramatic change ,
Bmr006_347	Yeah . ; But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't . ; Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . ; Yeah .
Bed004_911	OK . ; So the mistake would have make a mistake the system would have made a mistake here . ; Yep . ; Click ?
Bro027_1533	And now they all have that . ; I see . ; And so . ; Yeah .
Bed005_182	or " running in the cinema , ; which " ; OK . ; uh , " today evening " , uh i " Is anything happening in the cinema this evening ? "
Bmr023_935	just , you know just take care of the problem . ; So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . ; And I never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates . ; And so well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that
Bed009_514	Right ? ; So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi , ; let 's say . ; Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast ,
Bro003_1412	and HTK is an ASCII format . ; And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed ; Mm - hmm . ; and they used LabCut to to pass .
Bsr001_198	Oh , yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah , ; the uh , ; Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow .
Bmr022_244	Interesting . ; Oh , oh , th oh , I see . ; It 'd be impossible to r to misorder them . ; Yeah .
Bro022_1180	I don't I don't have a good feeling for it . ; Um . ; Pratibha . ; Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain
Btr002_2435	oh , I was ; " Lipsmack " ! ; Yeah . ; Oh yes .
Bro016_245	But there 's uh , your your your substitutions tend to go up as well . ; So , uh , I I I think that , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , the most obvious thing is just the insertions , @ @ .
Bro025_380	Oh , OK . ; I mean , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , um , it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past .
Bns001_1446	So how can I map these things uh to the UMTS stuff ? ; And what is the trend towards UMTS to the first generation ? ; And how it is possible to map this one to this technology ? ; And if you have the building blocks identified , what is really necessary for QS eh QS - in - Advance for for mobile systems , then you have , in principle , the ideas for the following generation what you could improve .
Bmr005_270	It 's not a meeting . ; Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if if we weren't being recorded . ; Yeah . ; Right , so I So my behavior is probably not natural .
Bro010_571	So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method . ; And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , uh , uh , determine through magical means that that , uh , there 's no speech in some period , ; and then see what the spectrum is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_818	and you go through it again , ; and that was it . ; Oh , and one one little bit ; w And uh , the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS .
Bed006_185	See ; Cuz we have you know people from other areas ; that 's what I suggested to him , that people like like Jerry and George and et cetera just ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1493	But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , uh , improperly , ; I mean , it was a nice study . ; Uh , they were doing this it wasn't word - sense disambiguation , it was ; Yeah yeah yeah
Bro024_1530	and then , must choose them somehow to give on average the best results for a certain range of the signal - to - noise ratios . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_68	Step . ; Well . ; There 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_305	I think so , ; yeah . ; Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting . ; I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others
Bed006_106	It 's very exciting . ; we 're sticking with the term " wizard " , ; Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr019_1058	which is that , you know , so th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked ; and and these ; Right . ; There 's just probably less backchannelling in general ,
Bed006_552	So the basic requirement fulfilled . ; Um , the basic requirement is fulfilled almost . ; When Andreas Stolcke and and his gang , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_382	Mm - hmm . ; Why is the landmark ; OK . ; The landmark is facing to the tourists .
Bed013_1366	Here 's hoping . Right ? ; Now cross your fingers . ; Yeah , I I mean , for me this is just a ba matter of curiosity , ; I wanna would like to look at uh , what this ad - hoc process of designing a belief - net would actually produce .
Bro014_843	we have the FFT , ; so we just ; So it 's it 's not really an excitation , ; but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation .
Bmr019_791	I looked at them . ; I spent two days um , in Waves ; OK . ; Oh , it was painful
Bns001_595	Yeah . ; Wh - when did you go through this ? ; yeah . ; I 'll I you uh I seen uh uh reports from nineteen ninety uh ninety - six , ninety - seven and ninety - eight .
Btr002_904	I do it all on the keyboard . ; Oh . ; OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_43	and and uh sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things . ; Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , ; we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events " ; but I think , you know , what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .
Bmr026_510	I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . ; Yeah . ; Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk . ; Yeah .
Bro018_380	because it 's to to do something like that . ; No ? ; Well , it says , since you 're taking a natural log , it says that when when you get down to essentially zero energy , this is gonna be the natural log of one , which is zero . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_862	w ; You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits , ; Mm - hmm . ; which is only what
Bmr003_1507	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling
Btr001_2231	That 's true . ; But . ; I thought that was really interesting . ; Or y
Bmr031_1467	So there 's some overlap there in what you m ; there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration . ; Yeah . ; Um , but Jeremy 's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side .
Bro023_458	so this was , uh ; And so this was giving ; um , ; this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it .
Bmr023_467	So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have ; been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . ; And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page ; Oh , great .
Bns003_262	OK . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yes , ; Yeah .
Bed008_1135	because uh well I mean if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values ; Right . ; so ; I mean it can get big fast .
Bed009_528	but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is . ; Mmm . ; Beyond what 's currently being implemented which is just word lists . ; Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse .
Bro027_707	right ? ; So I think , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing ,
Bns002_734	and uh the kind of power control I am doing uh , um , is more or less presented here , ; and what we are doing is to transmit uh with the minimum power needed depending on the distance to the destination . ; OK ? ; Every transmission is supposed to be done to a certain neighbor node
Bro019_197	So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine .
Bro025_171	And , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . ; Uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we didn't have any explicit noise , uh , handling ; stationary dealing with e e ; we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .
Bro005_459	it gives eighty - three point six . ; So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , ; But ; that gives eighty - seven point one .
Bed010_1054	Sure . ; OK ? ; Uh , " these are the decisions " ; I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information .
Btr002_2275	and so , ; you know , all the " uh " " uh 's " and " um 's " , and all those different things , ; That 's true . ; We - yeah , we filter all that out .
Bmr023_281	or including IBM 's ? ; Including IBM 's . ; Well , I don't know . ; The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks .
Bro018_252	OK . ; But even i in ; Oh yeah , in training . ; Still ,
Bmr003_957	because , like , I wasn't wearing a microphone ; f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones . ; Yes . ; But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ?
Bed016_132	and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what ; Hmm . ; in our beloved tourism domain . ; But , with a focus on
Bed002_1341	but sort of on your intuition of you know , " Aha ! ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is maybe a sign for that ,
Bmr018_86	It 's all a blur . ; Aren't the UW folks coming this weekend ? ; Yep . ; No . The next ,
Bro014_1587	or a feature or something . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's sort of what MSG does .
Bmr013_156	But Right . ; But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , ; H How ; Right .
Bmr030_146	Yeah . ; Right . ; So , ; he didn't know what I meant .
Bed006_1357	And " oh , OK , so I can do an Enter - View - Approach " . ; It 's not like that , ; right ? ; It 's more like you say " I want to , uh I want to do an Enter . "
Btr002_2211	Yes , she had . ; Oh , wow . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bmr018_550	Does any I forget , ; does anybody , uh , working on any any Eurospeech submission related to this ? ; I would like to try to do something on digits ; but I just don't know if we have time .
Bed003_1440	And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than " New York " , ; huh ? ; inferring everything from the context . ; So , works .
Bmr019_691	it was the same with tighter pruning . ; So for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better . ; You ; It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that that you don't lose anything .
Bro019_829	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean they just do the same thing again once more . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_581	I would rather not mess with them until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently dealing with , ; Yeah , I 'm ; Right . ; Well , I mean , how you choose to do it the naming is up to you .
Bed002_1170	You don't You know , you don't really like it . ; So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . ; We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , ; but hey .
Bsr001_412	Huh . ; And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous . ; OK . ; OK .
Buw001_1322	Uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . ; So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now ; You weren't interested ; Say I I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue ,
Btr002_2959	Yeah . ; and then they say a word . ; Oh . ; Right .
Bro019_1024	But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ . ; So they 're making ; there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed002_223	Oh , I can actually walk with this . ; This is nice . ; down here . ; That 's the Powder - Tower .
Bro021_228	Mm - hmm . ; And and ; so when you whiten it , then it 's like you the the only noise to to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise ; and you 've added the same thing to training and test .
Bns003_760	because sometimes subjects are fixed ; Sure . ; so you cannot you cannot , uh uh , give any any stuff you want . ; OK .
Bmr027_758	You reverse the signal , ; so it it lets people say what they said backwards . ; There you go . ; Backwards .
Bmr003_698	D does uh this tool you 're using is strictly ; Yeah . ; it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ? ; No .
Bmr019_1838	Wow . ; Oh . ; Very nice . ; Tha - that 's that looks great .
Bmr005_1484	Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , ; so we should think about trying to wrap up here . ; OK . Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we uh uh turn them turn ; That 's a good way to end a meeting .
Bed014_879	Good luck . Really . ; So that , so th thi this I mean , so this is the point , is we we 're going to have to cycle through this , ; but th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_827	I don't know how much the C - zero normalization business really matters ; I can't it see , I mean can't see it the ; Ca - can you run the SRI Just as an experiment , run the SRI front - end without vocal tract norma normalization , and see how much difference it makes ? ; I could . Yeah .
Bmr006_520	and then um , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question ; for ; We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . ; So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving ,
Bed006_739	Uh - huh . ; right ? ; the input into the action planning , as it is now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_420	eh um ; Oh it 's the ; Yeah . ; the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error
Bed015_112	And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , ; about what meaning what specific meaning you want . ; So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , ; you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , " the big th " , you you know , " the big the tall dark man " , you know , " walked into the room " .
Bro012_1515	and I tried that and it got way worse . ; There were lots of deletions . ; So it was you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1092	I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? ; No . ; Or s ? ; s ? Oh , OK .
Bmr027_1298	Do when when is this planned for roughly ? ; They should be I I imagine next week or something . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed013_648	That you already told me ? ; Not that ; No , no , no . ; OK .
Bro027_917	I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed . ; Maybe that 's it . ; Because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results . ; But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer , then
Bro003_134	but uh you know , don't don't bring a footlocker and we 'll be OK ; So . ; s ; W you 're staying overnight .
Bed006_881	but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're ; whatever , ; you know , that which are ; So very specific role names are " viewed thing " , " entered thing "
Bmr014_102	Yeah . ; OK . ; You you wanna volunteer to do that ? ; Sure .
Bro003_1580	and it 'll tell you if there 's space available . ; Yeah . ; Uh , and if there is then , uh ; But wasn't it , uh
Bmr002_1448	That 's it ! ; right ? ; Cuz he 's not heavily encumbered with this ; Yeah .
Btr002_1958	But just sort of just weird things like that , ; and , um Yeah , he had just left the room ; and gone and made a copy ; and he still had his microphone on ,
Bro027_381	Yeah , OK . ; So . ; OK , ; that 's fine .
Bmr022_920	E Well , there you go . ; Oh you 've you 've got one . ; Yes . ; That 's that it looks sort of like that .
Bmr024_1230	This is Hub - five . ; Oh , OK . ; Hub - five . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2537	Is it with s ; It 's it really come down to the driver . ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bmr029_150	It 's probably actually , uh It 's uh , I think it 's around thirty hours ; just for for one gender . ; That 's what I was thinking . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2004	So ; And we have the same sampling rate . ; Yeah . ; Sampling rate in the end .
Bed008_1275	given that these guys are ; I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , ; uh the co like all of them ? ; Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something
Bed006_1053	r Yes . ; but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose . ; Well , if I 'm if I 'm recipient of such a message ; and I get a Source - Path - Goal where the goal is a bakery
Buw001_50	You can write them on the board , if you want . ; Which way is ; Yeah , but it takes too much time . ; Mari ?
Bro025_473	Yeah . That 's that 's one thing which ; But you could even mark them , before they get to the server . ; Yeah . Right now we are ; Uh , ri
Bmr010_1132	And , he was the first first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck . ; And he 's saying " You you know , I always thought Chuck spoke really well . " ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved .
Bed010_234	when you 're ready ? ; Absolutely . ; Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing ; That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say " this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it " and stuff like that .
Btr001_1609	like , I I change time bins a lot , ; and I like will change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr010_653	it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one . ; and ; And there 's no adaptor for it ? ; Seems like there 'd be a
Bmr010_1176	in early times , ; is we would take , ; um , da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation ; and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , you 'd break up the word , uh , into five equal - length pieces
Bed011_377	and ; This means audio , but ; Huh ? ; no transcriptions of course ,
Bed015_1192	Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's it 's like I was thinking of type constraints ; but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema . ; " Agent " , I mean , the the performer of the X - schema , ; that s depends on the X - schema .
Bmr018_611	whe ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_860	Um , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . ; So , um , I corresponded briefly with him . ; I , uh , c I ; He still has an account here .
Bmr024_1083	Yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings . ; Well , s ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1072	Like you can't tell , ; Mm - hmm . ; mm - hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_148	OK . ; So have you heard back from Brian about that , ; Chuck ? ; Yes ,
Bmr008_1323	OK , so this is post bug fix . ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK ? ; Good , OK .
Bro005_900	OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers .
Bro016_291	Mm - hmm . ; But they might change that ; those weightings . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_291	but at that point at that point it wouldn't be much different to to wear this or that . ; Yeah , ; go to that . ; Right ,
Bmr002_920	Oh ! ; I think that would be lovely . ; Now , so , are we talking about the stage of uh simply the word stage ? ; or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment as well ?
Bmr008_1019	OK . ; We done ? ; With that form . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_598	Right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here . ; You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output . ; That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it . ; Oh , it 's just not working .
Bro024_60	Or we could , um , use some other amount . ; So like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test , ; um , but , for I tried twelve seconds in train . ; And I tried , um , um , the same in train
Bmr024_432	It 's not that ; Why do you ask ? ; I could ; No , actually , um , NIST has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a , um a time ,
Bed012_763	once we have the belief - net done ; You 're just gonna have to explain it to me , then , on Tuesday , ; how it 's all gonna work out . ; You know .
Bmr022_163	You mean , so , actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it . ; " beep " ; Put in put " beep " in as a word . ; And pu and have a beep model .
Bmr019_1496	Actually this this , um So , there 's another paper . ; so . ; It 's a Eurospeech paper but not related to meetings . ; But it 's on digits .
Bro019_291	Hmm ? ; You probably wouldn't ordinarily . ; I mean you sort of ; you 're at home and you 're trying to log in ,
Bmr002_1083	Well , my my impression ; I I I really thought of these resources in the context of you you asking about time aligning the ; you know , What would you need to indicate ; Right .
Btr001_2687	And that was like a Stroop test in some ways . ; It took a lot of conc ; When I was doing those I had to really concentrate . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_750	How many how many institutes can you say do that ? ; Yep . ; Pop goes the data . ; OK .
Bro024_1798	Do you , uh ; Well , I only say that the this is , a summary of the of all the VTS experiments ; and say that the result in the last um , for Italian the last experiment for Italian , are bad . ; I make a mistake when I write .
Bmr013_993	Um , and then one of the one of those . ; Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , um , and try them out . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , if we like them we 'll get more .
Bmr011_630	So ; and the assumption that you could time align the two . ; Yeah . ; And y it 'd certainly gets skew .
Bed005_569	What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , I didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal of the whole route . ; Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . ; And some other stuff . ; And I suggested that they should n be k uh , kind enough to do s two things for us ,
Bro024_346	Yeah . ; if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds . ; Yeah . ; The way I currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds .
Btr001_2794	there you go . ; OK . ; OK . ; So , here we go .
Bed014_90	That 'd be weird , that he has both the Java Bayes and the embedded Bayes in ; Yeah . ; But that 's some sort of conversion program ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_133	There we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things . ; Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? ; OK , h well I mean how is it different from user finance ? ; Um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life ,
Bro003_1091	Mm - hmm . ; So , what it it blows out is the number of uh testings . ; And , you know and the number of times you do that last part . ; But that last part , I think , is so has gotta be pretty quick ,
Bro021_62	Um , ; and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector . ; Mmm . ; This actually don't s doesn't seem to help ,
Bro003_1369	it 's not labels by hand . ; Oh , ; " l labeled " . ; I 'm sorry ,
Bed003_444	So final dest ; right ? ; So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , ; Which is th Which one ?
Buw001_1914	That 's what we could do . ; You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor ; Yeah , why search for them ? ; True .
Bed010_18	The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like " Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . " ; It actually says , " Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , " ; which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences . ; OK .
Bro003_1783	You can throw something in . ; You can do pretty well . ; But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that , ; and you worked on for few months , as I recall ,
Bmr001_575	and so uh we should look at this carefully ; Yeah . ; but ; Yeah , I was interested when I saw the twenty - four on there .
Bmr012_448	Yeah . ; which I guess ; I was just gonna say , ; Well that 's those are the only we ones there are ,
Bro016_784	um ; Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1578	Mm - hmm . ; g And it gave me like , uh , one point One more than one percent relative improvement . ; So , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . ; So it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement ,
Buw001_330	and go like that if you want to . ; That 's a good idea ; It 's ; but that doesn't
Bed015_1076	not all of us . ; And ; the thing is that that I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . ; It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been ,
Bmr022_1415	And , either you have to do everything or you share responsibility . ; Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro projects face this same problem . ; Right . ; You know , p anybody can check out the code ,
Bro027_521	Uh , ; It 's like forty plus forty plus ; median . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_1501	Mm - hmm . ; Well , we have the unintelligibility convention . ; And actually they have one also , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_883	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Uh , OK . ; Uh so there is this combination ,
Bmr009_1094	Yeah . ; Of course , that 's very different from , like , Michigan , or ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_908	Good point . ; But he he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly , ; Yeah . ; Spurious .
Bro019_1533	No , no . ; It 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the LPC polynomial . ; Polynomial . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1401	So . It works . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and they have I mean they have better adaptation than we had than that that system , ; Yep .
Bro014_411	I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing . ; that 's an ar ; Well , that 's an argument for it , ; but let me give you the opposite argument .
Bro010_594	Cuz if you don't look into the future , ; right ? ; OK , ; well that I guess that was my question ,
Bmr018_1594	Well it 's different for different tasks . ; Yeah . ; It was Liz . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1649	If you take like a target speaker , and maybe ; Yeah . ; well , I mean , if there 's enough data , maybe two ; two target speakers
Bsr001_1753	That 's ; but I guess that was more ambitious . ; We were thinking something like , you know , ten hours to begin with . ; They were gonna
Bro027_735	Wow . ; So this is almost ten percent . ; With the f with the neural net . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_713	Yeah . ; Duration . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh , um , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .
Bmr015_846	but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy .
Bed012_203	as for th to decide the response . ; And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes . ; OK . ; Say , if we had to y deal with arbitrary language , it wouldn't make any sense to do that ,
Bro017_62	because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks . ; Right . ; But unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done , ; because French Telecom was saying " no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code ,
Bro021_984	It has to be some , uh , Taylor series ; Yeah . ; Now , this is the ; and then
Bro017_546	But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement . ; yet , wi with the current system . ; Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with ; because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions
Bmr025_253	I guess I do . ; Yeah . ; Or S or Steve Renals . ; James Christie .
Bro004_588	And perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that Italian . ; Do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the Aurora ? ; And ; Mmm , no .
Bns001_851	No no , uh that is a typical application , I think , ; which is , in principle , also a little bit related to uh to the network . ; But not any application . ; And we also have the aspects for security .
Bmr023_477	Um , ; and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , ; but I 've got a bunch of ; uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth .
Bro023_365	Is at what level ? ; It 's the ; it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it . ; No , what 's what 's the number ?
Bmr018_951	But I think it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me , ; It 's possible . ; that you delete something ; So let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here .
Bed016_1029	I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " ; in a sort of ; doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , ; just give me a phone number
Bed003_714	I see . ; Hmm . ; And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you ; kinda thing .
Bns003_165	Right . ; and I could only pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages . ; Ah , the messages . ; Oh .
Bro028_899	It 'd turn Wiener filtering into spectral subtraction , or whatever . ; But there 's other things that we 're not doing . ; So , we 're not making any use of pitch , ; uh , uh , which again , might might be important ,
Bro021_1234	I need to calculate this . ; And for calculate this , I have an I I can develop an expression that is ; Yes . ; It 's overlapping .
Buw001_893	Um ; That 's great . ; So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . ; Ow .
Bmr006_600	Oh . ; And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . ; " We " By " we " of course I mean Dave . ; Wow .
Bro011_504	Mm - hmm . ; So ; OK . ; then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision .
Bed005_1092	So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? ; and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ? ; Right ? ; Well . OK , so th so the important point is W not what the G function is .
Bmr008_1685	Yeah . ; Right , ; That r that was an interesting statistic . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1725	Like it 's not ; On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I ; So this this happens in the very first one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_709	Mm - hmm . ; And , ; yeah . ; OK .
Bmr013_494	Yeah . ; That 's actually what I was thinking , is tha ; So I was thinking ; Right .
Bro011_681	Well one thing I mean , if I if if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . ; So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_625	Yeah . It 's , uh , funny looking at some of the transcripts . ; I was filtering by person , ; Mm - hmm . ; and in one of the one of the early meetings , one pers particular person , almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was " yeah " , " uh - huh " .
Bed003_1070	Yeah . ; That 's how actual probability tables are specified . ; As , like , lists of numbers . ; Yeah .
Bro019_117	you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . ; So you can say " run dash command L S " , ; and , um , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . ; So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run ,
Bmr027_1037	And it 's also a g a good indication of the of that . ; The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia ; and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . ; Uh , OK .
Bmr019_362	Right . ; Yeah . ; That 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the r the set up here . ; Right .
Bmr020_1197	Is it i d y is it ; Oh , OK . ; So what it what it what it involves is is really a s uh , uh , the original pr procedure , ; Transcriber will do it .
Bed010_1034	Uh . I I think the one you you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too . ; Sure , yeah . ; A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh ; Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .
Bed015_1650	That 's horrible . OK . ; Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL ; where , you know , you 're signing ; and someone says something .
Bed013_1339	Mm - hmm . ; And just by an additional link ; Oh . ; What ?
Bmr009_670	Then you 're gonna w have a wash . ; Mm - hmm . ; And hopefully it 's more like on the order of ; I 'm not sure that 's necessarily true .
Bed004_202	And um ; So , some some work needs to be done , but I think we can uh ; And this , and in case no you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection . ; Ah .
Bed010_475	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . ; Yeah . ; Yeah make yourself a note .
Bro018_411	Yeah . ; OK , and wh when did Stephane take off ? ; He took off ; I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow .
Bmr011_1192	So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time ; bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . ; Right , so I think we talking about three level three things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_184	Um yeah because I guess there 's some , ; Or so . ; and Don can talk to Jane about this , ; there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh
Bro017_140	uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too " we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet . ; We should at least try once again , one more round . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1380	running through these a hundred times faster ; because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings , ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_110	So so ; you 're not talking about the entire page ? ; Yeah . ; Correct .
Bed013_748	Mm - hmm . Yeah . And ; And how much to get into the cognitive neural part ? ; We ; That 's the only That 's the question mark .
Bro014_1151	So - It 's Y ; this picture ? ; yeah . ; What does it look like for unvoiced ?
Bdb001_1010	So , I guess , ; yeah , ; if if you and Don can if you can show him the P - file stuff and see . ; Sure .
Bed004_839	then um ; Or , you know , " what is there in the castle " or ; so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container ; and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff .
Bmr022_285	No , two is probably better than what I was suggesting , ; because what I was suggesting , in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing , you 'd have to have the the tonal differences between the two kind of small , ; and actually you want them large . ; Yep .
Bmr026_608	How long is David gonna be gone ? ; Uh , eleven days or something ? ; Oh my ! ; Yeah
Bro021_1110	Well . The idea ; Well , ; we have fixed this equa ; OK . So now once you get that that one , then you then you do a first or second - order , or something , Taylor series expansion of this .
Bmr009_173	Yeah . ; Log energy . ; These the These are the the first experiments uh with comment uh ; Sorry .
Buw001_2049	as you could be with these things hanging on you . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , I think that 's always desired . ; I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can .
Bmr005_1097	not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response , ; but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos . ; Um , a number of people have done this ; so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it .
Bro013_611	so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies . ; That 's as as a separate thing . ; i ; Yeah .
Bro014_1130	Uh - huh . ; and for unvoiced it 's something that 's more flat . ; Uh - huh . ; Right .
Bmr009_1637	I 'm I 'll be around just have to make call before quarter of . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I
Bmr006_1551	Mmm . ; Ugh ! ; Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_658	Yeah . ; And it 's also it 's depending on not only that ; Mmm . ; Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms
Bed015_715	Great . ; Um , ; the I w I would just ; s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat .
Bro004_1098	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's This is mostly better than baseline , ; although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . ; Well , it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill minus thirteen .
Bsr001_237	otherwise my joints here . ; I mean , depending where I put it , it press different things , ; Mmm . ; but that 's a @ @ fine .
Bed015_1892	And then we 'll we 'll we 'll go back over it ; and w people will will give feedback on it . ; OK . ; And then then we 'll have a at least initial spec of of what we 're actually trying to do .
Bed003_521	So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases ; Yeah , yeah . ; but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you ; Yeah .
Bed010_463	Alright . ; Yeah . ; Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff . ; OK .
Bed006_1691	I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . ; Like I know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bmr031_997	OK . ; Should help with the transcripts . ; Right . ; They wer so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous .
Bmr016_726	So . ; so we 'll be ; And I guess Espen ? ; This is uh is he here too ?
Bmr018_1627	that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , ; and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way , ; Machine - learning . ; and and the the , uh ,
Bro021_1050	It 's log o of capital Y . ; Yeah , right . ; and then ; Yeah .
Bro025_477	Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . ; Oh , ; OK . ; So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed .
Bmr026_103	I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . ; Yeah , I haven't done that . ; So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1280	Right . ; Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying " OK , our feature set will be the FFT " , ; cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_309	The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to ; get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in ; Yeah , I mean we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1617	uh , and then we 'll turn off the mikes , and then I have one other thing to discuss . ; OK . ; I actually have to leave . ; OK .
Bro017_1177	What you know , nowadays , ; yeah . ; It 's actually do - able , almost . ; Is the um
Bmr009_204	So . ; Yeah . ; I mean , there might be something there . ; I don't know .
Bmr013_617	Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . ; And ; No , actually it 's a different meeting . ; Good .
Bro019_1089	Yeah , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; Now there are some adaptation though ,
Bmr003_2525	whenever you want " . ; So I think it won't be a problem . ; Oh , cool . ; And and it 's a a PCMCIA card , right ?
Bro003_1794	um ; And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , ; uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . ; So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing ,
Bmr022_900	or the ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but I don't know that one .
Bmr024_560	But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . ; So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . ; You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet ; Hmm .
Bmr013_655	uh , I mean we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh , couple examples of . But but , uh , ; Yeah , m ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_289	But I mean , ; And you just have to bring it up . ; but at that point at that point it wouldn't be much different to to wear this or that . ; Yeah ,
Bro004_1268	Yeah . ; We c we can find out . ; Cuz you gotta do something . Otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together ; No they 're
Bed005_206	Oh , wow . ; Um , I mean , these sentences are just silly . ; Hmm . ; I mean , uh , d these were not the ones we we actually did it .
Bmr005_865	And when when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different . ; Oh yeah , definitely . ; You know , I did I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well . ; I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs .
Bro023_861	uh ; pow ; it has the overall power spectrum of speech . ; So with a bump around one kilohertz .
Bro005_1190	it 's just that they have the ; I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , ; and it 's it uh it 's just that they d it 's trained up , ; right ?
Bmr019_1487	Uh , you you and , uh and Dan have have a paper that that 's going in . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You know , that 's that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation stuff .
Bro005_934	Uh , training set , ; um , ; Uh - huh . ; uh , training targets
Btr002_1572	Yeah , there 's some Those are those are nice . ; I 'm not a big ice cream fan . ; Really ? ; Oh .
Bmr027_366	No . ; No . ; We have what they put on the speaker form , ; Oh .
Bmr028_286	which is the first day I get back . ; OK . ; So ; OK .
Bmr019_927	And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where not not a lot , but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's . ; So there was some speaker identif ; And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before uh , before we had the multiple audio available ; f
Bed009_1065	the sor w where we are at now is is this , ; they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . " ; So th the and this is an again attempt to get very wide coverage . ; So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .
Bmr015_379	but it 's it 's usually a pretty ; But it ; Yeah . It 's it 's certainly not I 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something ; Right .
Bns001_536	And it the the latest report I I found was in nineteen ninety eight . ; And in this report , well , they they pres they have uh some slides , some uh papers , some well , a lot of things . ; Hmm . ; And well the main thing and the quick uh thing I I was uh looking at was a a video available in MP - thr in MPG M - peg format .
Bmr018_385	Right . ; So you have a separate ribbon for each channel , ; There 're separate ribbons . ; and and i i it 'll be because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his with Thilo 's new procedure ,
Bro018_492	If you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to to do the kind of level of of uh classification of phones that you 'd like . ; So that was that was the idea . ; And then the other thing that we were discussing was was um OK , how do you get the your training data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1449	And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that , again , was speaker - dependent with lots of feature selection ; and a very complex sort of thing .
Bns003_822	OK , ; sounded good to me . ; And Michael ? ; So , I won't change the topic then .
Bed005_1377	Yep . ; This is with the whole thing , ; we may have to build another data stru ; Yep .
Bro004_323	Mmm . ; It sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language ; or I mean . You have the same number of parameters in the neural net , ; you haven't increased the size of the neural net ,
Bmr016_1723	Sh - shouldn't it be " QUAL TICKLE " or something ? ; Of course . ; Like it 's not ; On the in the actual script in the actual transcript , I s I
Bed013_1451	We have uh , eh found someone here who 's hand st hand transcribing the first twelve . ; OK . ; First dozen subjects ; Uh - huh .
Bed006_554	When Andreas Stolcke and and his gang , ; Mm - hmm . ; when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary , then we can actually a put it all together ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1862	W We know it 's eight channels . ; Uh , we know it 's digital . ; It 's eight tape recorders . ; We don't even know if there 're microphones .
Bns001_564	It 's the same ? ; Ah we just discussed a lot about proxies . ; Oh , OK . ; That 's a fun
Bmr016_219	I did ; So we have ; Mm - hmm . ; Sorry ,
Bed006_1116	Mayb - yeah . ; You have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro016_516	Right ? ; Because it was taken from a different , ; uh ; I mean they were different drives .
Bro023_619	Mm - hmm . ; So that 's the basic principle . ; And you get ; you can do that
Bed008_1361	Not one quarter , ; so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . ; No . ; So you can view these as gone .
Bro003_1207	Um . ; Well , you have a ; I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the uh , a all these combinations , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_163	Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK . ; Well , you know , it 's like I 'm not I 'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse ; because I don't think that it 's ; Sure .
Bmr014_777	OK , well , if that 's what it said . ; And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l ; I 'm not a law lawyer , ; but it strikes me that uh , we wouldn't want someone to say " oh yes , I was a little concerned about it
Bmr024_790	Yeah . ; They they even have a reading list . ; I bet that sounds good , ; It 's pretty funny .
Bed009_1108	Mm - hmm . ; you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved ; Yeah ; OK ,
Bro016_783	You know , they could be , ; um ; Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1406	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_735	Mm - hmm . ; um , until we can do that kind of processing . ; And so , once we have some some of yours , ; OK .
Bed005_392	Hmm ? ; Oh , yeah . ; And , um ; So , whenever it it encounters " Goodbye " ,
Bed006_845	It 's gonna be one y you 'll pick one of those for ; Right . ; OK these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role . ; Right , so the the the roles will be filled in with the schema
Bmr010_1589	OK . ; So . ; I I have as well , ; so if you need need help let me know .
Bmr008_279	That ; Right . That 's what we 've done so far . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr002_643	because you have , ; um ; Uh - oh . ; You have these y y you still have The frequencies are represented
Bmr009_1610	Yeah . ; However . I also understand that you can have widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro013_300	What else we got ? ; Um . ; Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions , ; But
Bro012_1205	um ; you from that you you estimate ; or you estimate fine harmonic structure , ; whichev
Bmr024_930	and they 're still all fine . ; Were they burned or were they pressed ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , both .
Btr002_1853	Yeah , ; And there was all this meta stuff about ; that was fun . ; Cuz I was giving a report on what the comments were ,
Bmr008_1401	And And And did is this from the mixed signal ? ; it 's cheating , ; but not completely if they 're often not overlapping and normalized for the speaker ; Yeah .
Bro011_119	Right . ; yeah , it removed this mean . ; Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter , ; I mean , uh the the mean normalization and
Bro012_1044	I think they want to work on the second stream also , ; but more with some kind of multi - band ; or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_88	it 's pro it 's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . ; So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word " throw " , ; or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , " happy " , or something like that . ; Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word
Bmr012_223	yeah i it was a complicated bug ; because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random ; so ; Oh .
Bmr018_361	I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do . ; So , they 're they 're looking at a mixed signal , ; or they 're looking ; what what are they looking at visually ?
Bed004_831	say that this i this is the kind of construction in which the ; there 's Let 's say there 's a uh cont ; there the the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . ; OK .
Bed012_898	right ? ; But if you said something that was completel er ; h theoretically the construction parser would do that ; But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever , n people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about .
Bmr022_474	That 's the shortest meeting we have . ; Most of them are double that , or ; Yep . ; Well , I was just wondering what the average length thing was .
Bed009_44	So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs . ; Hmm . ; And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times , ; Yes .
Bmr027_663	and ; I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now . ; Yeah . That 's true . ; Right .
Bro005_609	Yeah , and test across everything . ; and uh ; Yeah , try all these different tests . ; Mmm .
Bmr006_1262	I mean , I I think it 's I can see the value o ; Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , ; but I mean But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different . ; Yeah , OK .
Bns001_1164	and nobody is has the skills to deal with that . ; And then we are leaving our scope anyway . ; OK . ; My impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already .
Bed015_235	Oh , one thing I should mention is about " designates " . ; I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . ; So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_176	OK . ; So there 's um ; Alright . ; Well maybe we should just
Bed015_1780	Oh , that in that use of " about " , yeah . ; clever . ; Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1321	And then , how to make it work is is the second part , ; in the sense that I mean , m the guy who was doing the ontology eh , eh , s ap apologized that i it will take him another through two to three days ; because they 're having really trouble getting the upper level straight , ; and
Bmr027_903	Six ? ; But , no of different people . ; So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . ; But How
Bmr007_661	So , I don't know . ; To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls ; but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can . ; Can .
Bed015_517	And ; you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , ; and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now . ; If there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job ,
Bro012_1193	Larry Saul could be an idea . ; U ; We were are thinking about just kind of uh taking the spectrum ; and computing the variance of of the high resolution spectrum and things like this .
Bed017_271	Some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site . ; Hmm . ; And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . ; And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction ,
Bmr028_1230	or ; But it does help to get the backchannels back in , and things like that . ; Right . ; So , whenever the Right now , the s the scoring is based on segments .
Bro017_89	So I don't see the problem . ; The biggest problem of course is that f that Alcatel French Telecom cl claims " well we fulfilled the conditions . ; We are the best . ; Uh . We are the standard . "
Bro018_777	Mmm . ; So they had one recurrent net for each particular feature ? ; Right . ; Right . Right . Right .
Buw001_1664	That 's right . ; And your email is ? ; i ; Edwards at
Bro018_1212	you know , this other one 's it was a pretty good system . ; I think , you know , one one percent word error rate on digits is uh digit strings is not uh you know stellar , ; but but given that this is real digits , as opposed to uh sort of laboratory ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_604	No . ; I mean , this is added noise . ; I mean , this is TI - digits . ; I 'm sorry .
Btr001_1614	like ; So , I guess I don't see too much of a difference ; but that 's just because it 's me . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_463	What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you ? ; Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w ; I mean ; Oh , no , no .
Bmr012_104	Mm - hmm . ; We we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on ; so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank . ; Um I I designed the form and I don't know what to put for my own region ,
Bro016_911	which , ; um ; I think maybe we should , uh , try to integrate it in in our system . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_570	the start to be to the finish . ; And , uh , it 's a little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part ; and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . ; Anyway , so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs
Bmr009_1499	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_591	Yeah . ; Sounds like a great idea ; but but I think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1747	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But , eh , I I will try to recommend , eh , at , eh , the Spanish government ; but , eh , the following @ @ scholarship , eh , eh , eh , will be here more time ,
Bed008_510	and it would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something . ; Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , ; it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_911	Yeah , I mean , see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with " Go - there " is either gonna be true or false . ; Well , what ; Whoops . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1568	Oh , how interesting . ; and ; But , I mean , it 's still It 's still cool . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1842	and it 's , um , it 's an effort by linguists to come up with , um , a machine readable IPA , um , sort of thing , ; right ? ; And , um , they they have a web site that Stephane was showing us that has , um has all the English phonemes and their SAMPA correspondent , um , phoneme , ; Yeah .
Bmr028_383	Great . ; OK . So , anyway I looked at everybody else 's stu ; It 's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression . ; Good .
Bmr030_818	Well , that would be pretty tight i in the machine room . ; Yeah , it would have to replace Abbott , basically . ; Eesh ! ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1232	because of the way the microphone 's adjusted . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr007_957	" Mixed . " ; " Mixed " . ; " Mixed ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1702	and they 'll do whatever they want with it . ; Yeah . ; But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level ; Yeah . Good idea .
Bed006_88	You could do it about you . ; Well I didn't know . ; Yeah . ; I didn't mean to be humor copying ,
Bed005_281	Hmm . ; whatever . ; Nothing was specialfi specified . ; except that it has some references to audio - visual media here .
Bmr009_1292	right ? ; Right . ; I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in . ; Well , we thought about it .
Bdb001_842	One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store , ; Huh . ; so that , uh , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1238	Yep . I we know about it . ; where ; So , um , I have to convert the , uh , transcripts into this format , and then the scoring program actually looks at the times . ; And , uh , you know , it You can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your references ,
Bro016_512	So ; And , uh , ; it it doesn't appear that there 's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages , that that going to a different language really hurt you . ; And the noises were not exactly the same .
Bro017_367	Unless this noise is modulated . ; If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . ; Mmm . ; The moment you moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .
Bdb001_344	Well , what does H T K do for features ? ; Or does it even have a concept of features ? ; They ha it has its own ; I mean , Entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , S - SD or some so SF or something like that .
Bmr019_4	OK . ; So , I mean , everyone who 's on the wireless check that they 're on . ; C we ; Alright .
Bmr002_1109	Um . I I think we won't probably talk until we have more data , ; I would think . ; Right ? ; Right , since we have almost none right now , let 's
Bed015_711	you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess ; and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . ; OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I we have thoughts about those as well . ; Yeah .
Bns003_144	A restricted in . ; Not . ; Huh . ; Not a no FTP .
Btr002_702	Uh ; And that 's that 's th you know , I would watch the visual sis signal to avoid that . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro017_315	Because uh ; And and and so on and so on . ; So we are learning quite a lot about that . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_1119	somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . ; I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with , ; and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . ; Uh . Um
Bmr007_1050	The mixed signals , eh . ; I I think it 's it 's difficult , um only to en with energy to to consider that in that zone We have eh , eh , overlapping zone Eh , if you process only the the energy of the , of each frame . ; Well , it 's probably harder , ; but I I think what I was s nnn noting just when he when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things ,
Bmr008_653	That 's it . ; then we should have some question where it 's not free form , except for these people who are who have non - American English accents . ; There we probably have to have a category " Non - American English " and then a few choices . ; And we should have something that 's simple , that people can circle , like these TIMIT regions or something , so that we have something that minimally you can
Bmr020_657	It 's really impolite if you don't , ; and ; So . ; Huh .
Bro011_587	So the majority of them wanna have nine states . ; And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . ; So my guess uh ; And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case ,
Bed005_825	I mean , it 's ; I d It ; We don't know how to handle the declarative forms , @ @ really , ; and , then , the interrogative forms , ah - oh .
Bmr003_1166	I w got an extra factor of three there . ; Right . ; So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? ; Yeah .
Bro019_534	Uh , no ; there is a slight different . ; Uh ; I mean , which are extracted at the handset
Bed017_396	and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that ; and uh As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , ; which are very , very coarse grain , ; so you have some like , science , biology , and then
Bed013_494	OK . ; I 'll ; OK . ; And the ad and and the deadline is the fifteenth of June .
Bro022_1098	But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; That 's something I observe using that filter .
Bro017_575	Yeah . ; But . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro019_1331	Huh ? ; Cumulants or something . ; Uh , I don't know . ; But No .
Bmr020_1430	OK . ; So we just run that one ; We can do that . ; There are lots of ways to do it .
Bns001_1770	I could not I f didn't have the time in the past ; and I will not have it in the future ; and maybe I will stay here only s four weeks or five weeks . ; So it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when I am leaving
Bmr024_1544	Oh ! ; Cool . ; Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , ; but there 's something going wrong
Bsr001_1079	and thi that That shouldn't be re redone . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr011_855	Right . ; And he was , you know , very interested . ; And , " oh , and how 'd you handle this ? " ; And I said , " well , you know , this way "
Bro021_502	Yeah . ; That will be really interesting to see , ; you know . ; So then you 're gonna feed the those into some standard recognizer .
Bed005_489	" need two seats here . " Nuh . ; " And where is it playing ? " There should also be a reference to something , maybe . ; Our d This is re um ; Mmm .
Bmr007_445	That 's also true of Switchboard . ; It 's happening a lot . ; I wasn't saying it wasn't . ; It may not be
Bmr006_526	Eleven ? ; And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . ; Where did you copy it to ? ; Well , it 's Abbott .
Bro008_80	Um , if , uh ; Cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing . ; And there 's things that we 're doing that they 're not doing . ; And and they all seem like good things .
Btr001_1289	Hmm . ; Um , like from start to finish , ; I don't know if I did one . ; so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself .
Bed014_1329	but that 's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings . ; Right . ; Yeah , yeah . No , that 's fine . ; It was a little strange .
Bmr003_2313	Um , ; so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ? ; Oh , ; I I 'm paid for .
Bed015_1640	Oh , good , I love the formali ; Um , ; Really ? ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed009_387	i Is it ; So there 's ac so there th the word " action " , OK , is is what 's ambiguous here . ; I think . ; Hmm .
Bed005_497	not the ; Yeah , OK . ; No , right , the Discourse Maintainer , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_752	It would be interesting to see what we get . ; Just , you know , low - pass filter the speech and ; Cuz there 's there 's a lot of work you can't do without that , ; I mean , how how would you
Bro022_191	cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , um , depending on the timing of the echo . ; So , um , ; I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , ; and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them .
Bmr023_494	and and doing spot - checking here and there . ; So , um , uh , I guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , ; um , but but ; Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the , uh , uh the the pipeline .
Btr001_1563	Yeah . ; I feel like I 'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know ,
Bro013_337	yeah . ; I think , yeah , this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best , ; because with the new VAD , it 's very the results are similar to the France Telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_811	OK ; so but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have . ; They 're all downsampled , ; yeah .
Bmr012_1087	Yeah well it 's ; Um so OK to just go order ? ; We 're in this for the long term , ; yeah .
Bmr001_81	So that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing . ; Oh . ; OK That 's good . ; So I don't need to fill that out right now .
Bed013_178	You could even say , " let 's take all the priors , ; let 's observe nothing " , and query all the posterior probabilities . ; It - it 's gonna tell us something . ; Right ?
Bns002_692	Uh , so what can we do to avoid this ? ; Of course we can choose uh our transmission values longer enough to reach from so the nodes from this area will be able to reach the nodes on this other area . ; OK ? ; But , again , we can assume that eh if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen .
Bro003_137	W you 're staying overnight . ; So just ; I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase , ; Oh yeah . Yeah .
Bro027_294	Yeah , ; it 's like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for us . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bro011_74	Yeah . ; So again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream ; and ; um Yeah I guess the the uh LDA filters they were doing do have
Bmr009_1593	Yeah . ; Oh . No . I just mean I just mean that it 's that that his ; Depends on how much work they did . ; Or ?
Bmr008_1488	some longer chunk of time , ; and then you looked at the amount of energy in that . ; and how does that vary over these different cases . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_1156	Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . ; Yeah , they 're totally hidden . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_461	Is - is isn't that neat . ; Then you 're gonna go home with it . ; It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , ; Yep .
Bed017_528	OK . ; Just checking . ; So , OK . ; Hmm .
Bed003_1584	It 's a even distribution . ; Like , ; whatever . ; Right ?
Bmr031_48	So , we 're starting right now . ; Well , that 's good . ; Yeah . Oh , yeah . The meeting 's started . ; This is this is the real thing .
Bsr001_184	Then if you click on one of the other ones , it clears that one . ; Hmm . ; Oh , ; but it doesn't actually do anything else ?
Bro003_768	Is that Was that distributed with Aurora , ; or ? ; One L or two L 's ? ; The newer one .
Bmr020_1799	that 's my opinion as well . ; Yeah . ; So we don't do anything for it with it . ; OK .
Bmr027_487	I I really don't see that it 's a problem . ; I I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ us try to contact them , ; For for th ; u just in case they hadn't gotten their email .
Bmr027_187	Yeah . Sorry . ; Mm - hmm . ; It was it was not the best characterization . ; But what what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members .
Bmr011_651	or a hun ; Yeah . ; So , I 'm kinda skeptical , ; but um I think that
Bmr028_888	I mean , it 's gonna be bad , ; Right . ; but , uh , it may not be , like , " won't decode " kind of bad . ; Right .
Bro024_1670	Uh - huh . ; And ; But the way it 's done is that um , for low gain , there is this non nonlinear smoothing actually . ; For low gains um , I use the smoothed sm uh , smoothed version
Bmr014_597	No . ; Uh , I mmm , use some some different features but not not ; Mm - hmm . ; The basic thing is this HMM base .
Bmr003_1454	you know ; oh , yes , ; there was some ; in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about I didn't worry about s specific start times .
Bro013_789	Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it . ; But I realized that that um when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero . ; And uh cuz because uh i it 's two syllables . ; It 's it 's more likely they 'll understand what I said .
Bsr001_1738	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . ; Yeah .
Bro023_512	and that doesn't seems to be a giving , I mean , that much improvement . ; I I didn didn't run it for the whole case . ; And ; and what I t what I tried was , by using the same thing
Btr001_1524	Mmm . ; Huh . ; Right . ; Leak their secrets ?
Bed010_243	Yeah . ; OK . ; Makes sense . ; But any so that e e
Bro016_559	Um . ; But , uh , ; it 's true . ; You know , maybe there 's parameters that other people have used
Bmr010_39	Well , we have steps forward . ; Well , it 's a it 's a big improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr018_444	Well that 's what I tried originally . ; So I I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform , ; Mm - hmm . ; but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll .
Bmr019_115	Yeah . ; Right . ; Probably the fact that it picks up other people 's speakers other people 's talking is an indication of that it the fact it is a good microphone . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1836	Ah ! ; yeah . ; Ah ! ; OK .
Bmr007_205	and so and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . ; No problem . ; And places also which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison different words of course ; but you know , the basically , you know everyone 's saying " yes " or you know , or ev even more sp specific than that .
Bns002_118	Uh , OK . ; Here you have several several uh , proposed , uh , scenarios for for used this networks . ; When no network is available , ; OK ?
Bmr027_426	If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . ; you know . ; Oh , excellent . ; But the thing is that , you know , I I I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this .
Bro003_1444	je - je - je - je - je check out the results ; and and go that way . ; Oh , yeah , yeah , ; sure .
Bro011_69	Uh " try it " . ; Yeah . ; I see . ; I guess .
Bro003_2069	uh , ; nonlinearity , ; yeah . ; Um ,
Bmr014_487	the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And uh , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running
Bmr014_771	I mean , because if I object to the conversation . ; If I say " we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , " and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . ; The ; I agree that the consent forms were uh , I cons
Bmr022_1153	Right , so you could get email . ; Send email to Jane that someone has done a revision . ; Right . ; I I wanna also say that , you know , this is a
Bmr014_663	I mean if people have ; Uh , ; I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . ; And then um if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " .
Bns001_329	Right ? ; or what or ; Well , ; If connection is lost , I am I 'm not sure if sometimes you 'd simply have to drop a connection . If you have outstanding connections .
Bro007_296	Uh - huh , uh - huh . ; The silence plus the KLT output ? ; Oh so you 're only using the silence . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_196	Yeah . ; that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_986	but it 's unlikely that they would be . ; And it 's so time - consuming . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that ,
Bns001_417	And then I go outside , and want to go still on , leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless LAN . ; And at a certain state , the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of UMTS or GSM is available . ; And at that state , you automatically , or based on the certain kind of user profile , switched to the um UMTS or GSM st uh network . ; That 's the only senseful application .
Buw001_190	Right . ; OK . ; Right . ; So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .
Bro010_672	and ; things like that , ; and ; Were his , uh , windows centered around the
Bmr006_1804	Yeah . That 's good . ; But they ; Right . ; And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue ,
Bro013_290	I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get ; Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US .
Bro003_879	So may maybe it 's ; From the deep South . ; So - s so it 's not really from the US either . ; Is that ? OK .
Bmr005_1227	Right . No , I think that 'd be great , ; So , I I I I was thinking of looking into that . ; if we can get more data . ; the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here .
Bmr025_334	So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um ? ; Mm - hmm , ; ranked . ; Excellent .
Bmr008_116	I see . ; I don't think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads , ; Right . ; unless we branch out to different types of meetings , but
Bed005_495	and that , whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema . ; So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state , ; not the ; Yeah , OK .
Bed015_802	But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though , ; that , um , we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like , you know , for instance , one ; Uh , you know , they they have constituents , right ? ; So you can like nest things when you need to ,
Bmr012_981	That be great . ; I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan ; but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ? ; I don't know .
Bed014_1071	Yeah . ; OK . ; Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this . ; Yes . Yeah .
Bmr005_669	but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , ; Yeah . ; it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have . ; Right .
Bmr009_599	And we 'd still have some funding for this project , ; I can do that . ; uh uh ; like probably , if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else
Bro004_1296	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , just have a bigger hidden layer . ; Uh But ; I doubt it would help by forty per cent .
Bro019_316	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yep . ; OK , ; sure
Bro010_35	Yeah . ; because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing . ; So what are you doing ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_795	Yeah , so anyway , so So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff . ; That 's cool . ; And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . ; Of course there are behavioral differences too .
Bed013_1085	I mean we 're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location , right ? ; actually ? ; Or , ; I mean , anyway , the node in the uh the ultimate , uh , in in the Bayes - net thing when you 're done , the the node that we 're talking about um , is one that says " request for location , true " , or something like that , right ?
Bed006_1477	including the sort of " miracle occurs here " um part . ; Right . ; And um ; is there more to be said ?
Bmr024_845	I didn't say that . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; I didn't say that .
Bed008_605	Well let 's should we finish this , ; I mean but surely the user interests ; Sure , ; OK .
Bed014_677	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . But that 's ; I mean this this function ,
Bmr027_1398	but we 're kind of running late . ; So . ; How long does it take you to save the data ? ; Fifteen minutes .
Bns002_956	So there the the power control eh algorithm should work , in order to use at each instant of time the minimum power need to reach ; The destination . ; the neighbor . ; That Because this is the way eh eh more transmissions uh
Bmr016_309	In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . ; So , there 's between , um ; Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups , ; and each one has between two and four groupings
Bmr029_668	OK . OK . ; So will you talk to him about that , ; or do you want me to talk to him ? ; I , uh , I I can talk to him .
Bed002_338	Sort of action " go " , ; and then an object . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ?
Bro012_218	I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate .
Bro023_811	because I 've been p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff . ; OK . ; So ; I was like going parallely
Bmr008_1592	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but eh I test different normalization ; I eh
Bmr010_87	h he was looking for , uh , speaker change points . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; As a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , uh , a putative , uh , speaker change point .
Bed017_99	OK . ; Andy , you actually go by Andy , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bro005_80	um when we use the training on TIMIT ; so , it 's multi - English , ; we have a ninety - one number , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_962	But ; Decision tree . ; Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , ; but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth ,
Bed014_1263	Yeah . Yeah . ; So . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro026_452	We 're not talking about computation time here . ; We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out . ; Yeah . ; So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on .
Bro017_1323	No . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you don't say " eight hundred and fifty " , you say " eight five oh " , and so forth . ; OK .
Bro022_928	Yeah . ; Mmm . M Yeah . ; Something that that I 've used in the past is , um when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . ; And you make your decision when the derivative is increasing for so many frames .
Bmr008_461	and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them " Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to " and so on . ; Well also , you you you he has a sep separate subject for Region . ; Uh - huh ; and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English .
Bmr029_182	Don just , uh , created a new version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized , ; but with different segmentation . ; And so Um ; It would be nice
Bmr011_1398	OK , next week you 're going to do it all . ; Yeah . ; And I 'm willing to try to learn . ; I mean , I 'm I would do my best .
Bmr007_429	It 's but I don't know how high , in fact ; Well , here I have a question . ; that would be interesting to know . ; See , I mean , i i le let me t
Bro007_454	Yes . ; Yeah , actually yeah . ; For the TI - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1057	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And everyone else is low , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1448	I never know how to pronounce his name ; because he 's sort of , ; S Swede ? ; uh , he is Dutch
Bro027_1048	and and that bothered some other people . ; u And so ; Uh - huh . ; they just chose that .
Bmr029_175	Yeah . Yeah . We did . ; Uh ; And there 's a bit of a question whether you want to use um , what segmentations you want to use . ; Yes .
Bed010_44	right ? ; Yeah , for a couple ; Yeah . ; So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a er in XML
Bmr016_88	Is that correct ? ; Well , we actually figured out a way to ; Yeah , the the ; the the groupings are randomly generated .
Bmr021_748	and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features . ; So that 's one difference . ; And the other difference is that in the , uh in the SRI system , the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest . ; And what they do is they d they subtract the maximum
Bmr009_1050	But ; Yeah , so this is a real problem . ; Yeah . ; I don't know what to do about it .
Bns001_1441	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; So . ; Um ; But then , to go , for instance , to UMTS , and figure out what is available within UMTS .
Bro021_272	Secondly , you happened to pick fifteen DB ; Mmm . ; and maybe twenty 'd be better , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1407	Before we i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also . ; Well ; But ; But then we had a slight difference in the in the scale .
Bro003_868	OK . ; Yeah , ; the No , the French is f yeah , from , uh , Paris , ; Oh ,
Bmr029_382	But it 's it 's not really true . ; It 's it 's sort of fantasy . ; It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1343	Did did they give a talk on this or was this informal ? ; So . ; No . ; No .
Bro008_397	It ; Right , ; it doesn't work . ; So , in a way , that 's , you know , that 's sort of the dominant thing
Bdb001_1176	So , ; um , ; the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated . ; And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version .
Bro010_279	I mean , as fast as talking to a person . ; It th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay . ; Yeah , ; so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something .
Bmr031_853	Mm - hmm . ; And , um So , ; Oh . ; the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed
Bro024_793	And you have to do something if you get these negative values . ; I mean , this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever . ; Uh , and then you have ; And then I think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this
Bro011_585	So that 's pretty close . ; Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter . ; So the majority of them wanna have nine states . ; And so theirs are s sort of twice as long .
Bsr001_2103	Yeah , that 's originally We should thank Jane ; Right . ; because that 's how I originally she showed me some transcripts and I thought , " Wow , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_406	Anything else ? ; Your mike is a little low there . ; I in Berkeley , yeah . ; So , uh You you have to go a little early ,
Bed006_1139	And I 'm , yeah I 'm I 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely , ; Right . ; Sure it ; OK .
Bmr022_882	Yeah . ; and send the bill to uh , ; Whoever will pay , ; yeah .
Bmr006_681	I 've seen it already . ; It 's a real problem , a frequently problem uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1295	Right . ; right ? ; Which is why I would think you would say Enter ; and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to Enter .
Bns003_1019	but only for administration stuff , ; Yeah . ; but for the technical discussion he was here one day . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1410	Mmm . ; Well , I guess I guess we can we can say that it will help , ; Yeah . ; but I don't know .
Bmr003_354	it 's just that ambiguous . ; I was wondering also , Get ready . whether the lights made any noise . ; Uh - huh . ; There 's definitely
Btr001_2738	Though the one I 'm working on now is like that . ; Well ; I would say don't worry about that , ; because , um , this is w
Bmr007_526	Your mike is ; So , in the two - person conversations , when there 's backchannel , is there a great deal of overlap in the speech ? ; That is an earphone , so if you just put it so it 's on your ear . ; or
Btr002_102	but that was the closest they could come . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , you know , with when you 're dealing with acronyms , ; Wow .
Bro017_584	More or less it 's finished . ; Yeah . ; Ma - nec to need a little more time to improve the English , and maybe s to fill in something some small detail , something like that , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_207	This is a very sensual thing . ; Yeah , ; I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up . ; so leave it on .
Bro005_1397	You 're almost done . ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; Al - actually I should mention
Bmr007_1285	that that would be that 'd be good . ; Good . ; Eh So that , uh , people 's ideas don't get ; Thursday crept up on me this week .
Bro022_603	So exact same training data ? ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed008_1519	Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given being asked ? ; Cuz ; OK . ; Yeah yeah .
Bmr003_2471	Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time . ; I I I I 'm I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people , ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro003_1181	I don't know . ; We can check really quickly , ; Yeah , ; I guess .
Bmr009_244	Yeah . ; So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever , ; just just look at those distributions . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1691	right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Robert . ; Well , but , uh , this is very good actually
Btr001_1186	Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right , ; This is very important . ; it 's already done .
Bed015_1988	Um , yeah , there should be I I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , ; yeah . ; where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_172	but this is not the case for Italian what where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um uh , well , I don't think this is a bug ; but this this is something in probably in the MSG um process that
Bmr012_652	well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's really good . ; so Andreas set up this recognizer and
Bed005_286	Yeah . ; Where it gets that from ; It 's correct , ; but I don't know where it gets it from .
Bed009_227	And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . ; Information related to the user and information related to the situation . ; And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that ; what we can get from the utterance .
Bmr005_1166	we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , ; and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really ; uh ; Well , do we have that much ?
Bro019_447	Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ? ; No . ; No . ; That i I
Bmr005_252	You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified ; uh , " in any publication using the data . " ; OK , well , individuals being identified , ; let 's say you have a a snippet that says , " Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . "
Bns001_1708	If you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end IP available , that could be a vision . ; Like . ; Can you repeat it ? ; Well , so he he says well IP to IP or end to end IP , is far well , it 's far away .
Bed005_965	It 's just a little embarrassing ; cause all this was in his thesis ; and I was on his thesis committee , ; and , so , I r really knew this at one time .
Bmr020_87	Uh , and you just sent off a Eurospeech paper , ; so . ; Right . ; I hope they accept it .
Bmr012_1024	So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , ; so I got a quote ; um ; We can fit we have room for one more wireless
Bmr003_257	Yes . ; Excuse me ? ; Audio D V ; Well , or something .
Bed016_771	and like , what is film , ; the state you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . ; It 's ; yeah , I mean ,
Bmr014_146	Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . ; Another wireless setup . ; I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired . ; So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?
Bmr016_1138	Actually , I will go through this in in order , ; so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second ; cuz we 're not ready for that . ; So on the fifth page , seven down
Bed003_308	Right , ; so f ; Right , ; but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists ,
Bmr009_1618	OK . ; I actually have to leave . ; OK . ; So . Um . I mean I had to leave at three thirty ,
Bmr020_1269	OK . ; and a and adding a tag if that happens . ; So she does the adjustments on those guys ? ; But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins .
Bmr001_782	Um . ; Yeah . ; And Yeah . ; As much work as you want .
Btr002_1422	because ; Yeah , i ; and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently ; Cuz , yeah , if the s the resolution If it 's moving too slowly then , like , if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused .
Buw001_828	The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , um , easier made easier if you had the video . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . ; As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to ,
Bmr027_1066	The , uh , version beyond this is ; So instead of saying " or " , ; especially those words , " also " and " oder " and some other ones . ; Those sneak in .
Bed003_277	That 's that that needs a lot of work . ; No . ; Right . ; Got it .
Bmr006_1705	Well , it ; Yeah . ; but then , again that kills your discourse analysis . ; Right .
Bed009_199	I should 've brought some slides , ; but what our ; So here 's the tower . ; Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower .
Bed013_535	Um . OK . ; So , is the What Are you just talking about you know , the details of how to do it , or whether to do it , or what it would be ? ; What would one possibly put in such a paper ? ; What to write about .
Btr001_564	Yeah . ; Oh , there 's no question . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah .
Bro023_446	Mm - hmm . ; Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise ; and then I found that it works ; it doesn't work for Finnish and Spanish
Bmr008_1427	OK . ; Th ; Yeah . ; OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal .
Bmr006_586	W w we are getting more space . ; We are getting , uh , another disk rack and and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . ; Uh so uh but that 's not gonna happen instantaneously . ; Wonderful .
Bro025_349	Yeah . So that 's the one which Stephane was discussing , like ; Mmm . ; So is it ? ; The smoothing ?
Bmr018_637	it was labeled ; Mm - hmm . ; it was transcribed incorrectly , ; something really bad happened ,
Bmr016_839	Alright . ; How do you do that ? ; N ; Eighteen .
Bed012_606	I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks , ; but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later . ; But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess , ; and he won't be here .
Bmr024_1440	OK . ; So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set . ; So right now , we 're using a ; I don't know ,
Btr002_201	Saying " so " at the end of something . ; Mm - hmm . ; And sometimes that would get transcribed as ; OK , so , let me just think of an example .
Bed006_694	Yeah . ; Also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future . ; So this is something that , you know , may also be a res As a result of your work ; in the future , we may find out that , you know , there 're really s these subtle differences between
Bed013_276	Oh , yeah . That 's the guy . ; We we we we g ; Wait , who ? ; Yeah , i that would the g the bald guy .
Bmr010_878	Uh , currently , um , we use special words . ; There was a there 's actually a word for uh , it 's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth ; Mm - hmm . ; Mouth stuff ?
Bmr026_693	So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to i to to be uh you know If I cou you know this could ; It 's cuz y you have a ; So you need a better developed feminine side . ; I 'm
Bmr003_1497	Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things . ; But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap ; but it it 's marked pretty clearly . ; Um , some of the backchannel stuff Jane had some comments
Bmr005_496	And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , ; it 's possible you eh in the eh ; i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_318	Uh - huh . ; What would the percentage be then ? ; Um ; See , that 's the question .
Bed014_161	Mm - hmm . ; Anyway , it We 'll sort this out . ; Um . ; But anyway , send me the note
Bmr028_1313	So . ; Yeah . I mean , t y I was thinking , th the other day , that this is not just conversational speech . ; The fact that is has so much technological jargon in it . I it makes it u considerably harder to , um me e e e to transcribe and to to double check and all those things . ; So , I think you 're gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac accuracy .
Bmr014_567	But um the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape , ; Oh , I see . ; But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . ; So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that .
Bmr012_262	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; and so the channels get a little asynchronous ; and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing doing click sounds .
Bmr029_147	No . It 's definitely It 's less than a hundred hours , for sure . ; It 's ; Yeah . ; It 's probably actually , uh It 's uh , I think it 's around thirty hours
Buw001_405	But , uh , ; I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . ; But it 's not ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1034	And transfer functions . ; Right . Exactly . ; Well , you can do You can you can you can do certain normalizations like , you know , gain control , ; Well , I think there 're lots of lots of ways of doing it .
Bmr008_1654	You could do that , ; yeah . ; I mean , be i And if they still overlapped , i i the ; That 's hard .
Bro025_143	Parameters . Yeah . ; Sure . ; Yeah , we can do it later . ; But , still so , there will be a piece of software with , uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default
Bsr001_1695	Why why is that ? ; So you 're having ; Wh - why ? ; Why ?
Bmr010_606	The Meeting Recorder mailing li ? ; Oh ! ; We should add him . ; Yeah . I I I don't know for sure .
Bmr018_510	Click ; Um , ; I had suggested it before . ; I just don't know whether he did it or not .
Bro005_236	It 's er error rate ratio . ; So ; Oh this is accuracy ! ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1446	Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's w it 's the checking in part that r we really care about , ; and that we can control with , you know , who can check things in and stuff .
Bmr031_1338	Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2708	and you know , maybe there 'd be ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's optional . ; Hmm .
Bro025_387	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better ; and and , um , if , uh , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's you know , a secondary issue .
Bed014_1174	Um , I ; it 'd it 'd be useful for me , if we want to have it a little bit more data oriented . ; To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_501	If you can see them , actually . ; It 's interesting , ; so if you watch people are going like Right right , like this here , ; Right .
Bed003_902	OK . ; It 's true . ; The safety net . ; I think you could just add it .
Bmr019_1229	Well ; And and we ; I mean , i I never thought about it before , ; Y yes .
Bro022_880	but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . ; Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . ; Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , ; but it plus energy is sort of
Bmr013_183	It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , ; Pre - prehistory . ; yeah . ; And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do .
Bmr001_677	Yeah , I mean that 's the thing . ; It 's OK to g ; Right . ; Which I 'm interested in .
Bro010_366	KLT ; KLT . ; Oh , KLT . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_312	Should I call his office and see ? ; Uh , well i it 's uh ; He was in . ; I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts .
Bmr003_2240	Hmm . ; No . ; Wonder whether it works any ; But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ .
Bmr018_1278	Weight . ; and we we had a little jury - rigged one with a welder 's helmet , ; Counter - balance . ; and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it as a counter - balance .
Bro016_985	Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bro022_641	Yeah . ; The complete SRI system is one point two . ; You you were HTK . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_650	because they 're almost always have signal on them . ; Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_600	OK . ; or are y ; No , no , no . There 's some I mean , I just there are there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things . ; Yeah .
Bed003_745	And if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same , ; Oops . ; right ? ; No .
Bed009_220	Does he wanna go there now ? ; Later ? ; How does the person wanna go there ? ; Is that person more likely to want to walk there ?
Buw001_434	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , sure . ; I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like ; y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection ,
Bed002_320	But you usually want to enter them . ; Some objects are more picturesque , ; and you more f more highly photographed . ; Then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants .
Buw001_1371	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , does it does the bias matter ? ; I I don't know . ; I mean , uh , that 's , I guess , a question for you guys .
Bed005_1234	There are a couple other ones . ; There are ways of breaking this up into s to to subnets and stuff like that . ; But , um ; The
Bed011_532	Hmm . ; Uh for ten bucks , probably quite a few . ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bro003_178	or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . OK . ; And again , I guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh then given this
Bed011_893	right . ; So " object " becomes " entity " , ; right ? ; Yep , that 's true .
Bmr023_227	Hmm . ; The Chuck chunks . ; Right . ; And so he talked it over with the transcriber
Bed009_1027	you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture . ; Mmm . ; OK ? ; And and we could you could do this .
Bro004_718	Right . ; and ; OK , but I think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this , ; do some reductions in what we 're looking at ,
Bdb001_508	that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other . ; OK . ; I I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , I mean , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that ; OK .
Bmr010_962	Uh , yeah . ; And Yeah , r right . ; Speech research . ; So , uh , who knows .
Bmr008_731	Washington and stuff , yeah . ; yeah . ; That 's true . ; So I think that adding the the TIMIT categories is a good idea ,
Btr002_744	Take one off , or something . ; Yeah . ; No , a I think ; Hmm .
Bed013_1103	Hhh . ; let 's have it fit nicely with the paper . ; I guess . I don't ; I don't see unde how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the g utterance , though .
Bmr009_1031	This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions ; Oh . OK . ; or very close . ; Yeah .
Bro013_285	uh I mean it 's still read . ; But I still think it 's much closer to to what what people actually face , um when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone . ; I mean . I don't think uh ; I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers ,
Bmr010_800	About what ? ; About the transcribers or anything or ? ; I don't know . ; Well , the other
Bro019_967	Mm - hmm . ; Is it is it the CMU ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , OK .
Btr001_2477	It 's hard to figure out what they 're doi what they 're talking about , ; and also they don't tend to talk very f ; there 's a lot of disfluencies when they 're laughing and talking . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_330	there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing . ; I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker .
Bro018_1054	which sort of implies that the networks are bushier , ; you know , there 's more things it 's considering ; which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good . ; So uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning too much .
Bmr005_1384	just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ? ; But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and ; No , I meant , ; um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs ,
Bed008_1398	That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right , so you can have a mixture that ; Right .
Bmr012_437	so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard ; the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1202	So , I mean , I think it 's it 's key that that the that you look at , uh , you know , what machines are fast , what machines are used a lot ; Uh , are we still using P - make ? ; Is that ? ; Oh ,
Bed013_390	And i ; Well , I really can't keep a straight face doing anything . ; My idea is , ; Setting that aside .
Bns001_913	um , now , how to say , the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario . ; But nevertheless , it 's not the best for ; and and and and uh ; s networking stuff .
Bmr015_377	Yeah . ; So , uh , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual , ; but it 's it 's usually a pretty ; But it
Bro013_783	So so it 's ; Yeah . ; So it 's it 's ; Everything 's fine .
Bmr014_359	It 's uh ; that 's including digits , ; That 's including digits . ; right ?
Bro021_1312	This is ; Uh , it 's in after the mel filter bank . ; So this is twenty or something ? ; Twenty - three .
Bro022_818	provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . ; Yeah . ; But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both ; Yeah .
Bns002_91	So ; an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination . ; So ; uh in a sense , what we have in this kind of networks , is that , uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes .
Btr001_509	and it 's hard to catch what it is ; is , cuz it goes by really quickly ; and you can't really tell ; Uh - huh .
Bro012_232	and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , ; alright ? ; Yeah . ; Um so from point five
Bed013_335	The paper . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; I was thinking about that .
Bro027_713	Um , ; and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , ; but ; I mean , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape .
Bmr023_1167	Yeah . ; So that would save a lot of time . ; And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets . ; Mmm .
Bmr018_248	or do we go ahead and send them a sample ? ; Why wouldn't we s @ @ w ; Let their ; i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them
Buw001_32	Yeah . ; Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_570	it 's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process ; because eh it 's confused with with noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there are a lot of
Btr002_1322	Oh . ; And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere , ; Oh wow . ; Oh .
Bmr006_1841	and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards . ; But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous ; Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . ; And you could listen to it , and it would sound the same .
Bed006_1797	Oh I You want audio ? ; You know . ; or do you want transcript ? ; No just just transcript .
Bdb001_268	OK . ; Yeah . ; That 's true . ; But you do have to keep them in there .
Bed015_710	right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b ; you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess ; and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . ; OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I we have thoughts about those as well .
Bmr018_1001	because we 'd have to completely redo those meetings , and we have like ten of them now . ; We wouldn't have to re - do them , ; we would just have to edit them . ; Well , and also , I mean , I still haven't I still haven't given up on forced alignment .
Bmr022_68	He said that ? ; th ; Uh , well in in some email that , uh , we had . ; Oh , on the email .
Bmr008_1248	So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it . ; Mmm . ; Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group ; Right .
Bmr019_1079	Yeah . ; Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts for doing the research , ; and we will Yes , we 're gonna try . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_19	Got it . ; Wants to conserve . ; But I I just You know , sort of keep on wiggling . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr006_1578	Mm - hmm . ; S i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who " you " was . ; Yeah . ; Shoot !
Bro005_416	Do ; This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the ; Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other ; Which number ?
Bmr024_1535	Hmm ! ; OK . ; So , is there something quick about Absinthe that you ? ; With this said .
Bed008_1243	and it 's so will take a long time to write down ; because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities ; which is already a lot of numbers to write down . ; So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set ,
Bed009_445	Yeah ; um is based on slots that have to be filled ; and the um kind of values in these slots would be fixed things like the a time or a movie title or something like this ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1811	I mean , y ; Mm - hmm . ; The the the representational problems are I 'm sure , will be there , ; OK .
Bsr001_977	Gets a little boost . ; Yeah , yeah . ; and other people are trying to get in , and they can never never get access . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1220	Yeah . ; I do think that that would help the information retrieval . ; Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information ; OK .
Bmr030_820	Eesh ! ; Yeah . ; Well , he David 's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_566	I 'm already on it . ; For that directory ? ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , great .
Bro005_968	Mm - hmm . ; Uh ; Yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably , ; not uh again a short - term sort of thing .
Bmr012_189	Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually ; Hmm . ; um ; I
Bmr016_350	so . ; So those speakers who are very quiet , shy ; That would be interesting to see whether that helps . ; r Right
Btr001_949	I think Nelson 's the only one who , uh ; Oh , Morgan . ; You guys call him Morgan . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro012_504	you 've done several changes here . ; Uh , ; do you know what pie ; Yeah .
Bro010_242	No . ; What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , uh , the the the surgical , uh , uh , microscopes and so forth . ; Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh , finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ? ; Um , we had a silence detector ,
Bmr013_742	Wonderful . ; Are the , um , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ? ; I mean , have you noticed any difference ? ; I 'm I 'm not sure , um , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , uh , I have have to loo have a look at them
Bns002_1250	Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; uh , carrying usually really s uh , sh nnn ,
Bed006_1276	Well , this is one of things we were arguing about . ; That 's like ; th this is this r ; OK ,
Bed002_129	So th ; Um . So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder ; and there are lots of different aspects of the project . ; Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future .
Bed002_700	But but we will still get the phrasing all over the place . ; OK . ; So you will know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_345	Yeah OK . ; I guess , yeah . ; Mmm . ; Alright .
Bmr002_553	In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap ; and there 's just that it 's not a very good model . ; Right . ; Oh , in terms of data format , what are we going to do about that ?
Bed003_1582	We need to look at all of them . ; I mean but , they 're even like I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc . ; It 's a even distribution . ; Like ,
Bed002_547	I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , ; Yeah . ; depending on these things . ; Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is ,
Bed010_1035	Sure , yeah . ; A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh ; Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1077	The question is , like whether ; Well , trying with and with and without , yeah . ; " Sorry , I 'm just I 'm just going to sleep . " ; But then there 's just one @ @ , like .
Bed015_1304	But anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events . ; Yeah . ; OK , good . ; Let 's let 's mark that .
Bro023_837	I see . ; it 's one , so you just subtract the noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then it 's b
Bns002_334	OK . ; Two two things . ; So that 's uh that 's uh , my my problem . ; First of all , eh , this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism ,
Bmr005_407	Uh - huh . ; And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event . ; Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_313	but I mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So I just plug in the Wiener filtering . ; Oh , OK .
Bsr001_2475	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Greasy wash water ,
Bro004_861	N ; I I I 'm trying the HTK with eh , PLP twelve on - line delta - delta and MSG filter together . ; The combination , ; I see .
Bro023_1653	so it 's not a hard decision . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence ,
Bed009_788	I can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place . ; oh ; Uh . I see . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bro021_605	and one is ; So , phases get added , modulo two pi , ; and because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi . ; And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase
Bro012_462	Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different ; but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall . ; OK . ; Right .
Bed009_145	OK . ; Eleven on Thursday ? ; I was just thinking I w I will have leavened by eleven . ; Right . Right .
Btr002_804	and , you know , press the button and " juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh " . ; Hmm . ; Cuz if you miss something and you wanna go back to it , it 's such a such a hassle . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_61	you know . ; Yeah . ; Would it m ; So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards .
Bed016_294	OK . And so forth and so forth . ; Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , ; and how we solved it , ; and some preliminary observations ,
Bro023_1471	I don't remember for this experiment what did you use for these two stage ; I used ten just ten frames . ; The ten frames ? ; Yeah , because
Bed006_888	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema ; and maybe there 's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know , how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics
Bns002_82	You know , uh , an ad - hoc network is made of wireless nodes . ; These nodes of course can be mobile nodes , ; and , eh in this network there is no network infrastructure . ; So eh the only active thing we have is the mobile nodes .
Bed010_1101	Right . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; So we 'll do that .
Bro012_468	Worse . ; Worse , yep . ; Out of what ? ; I mean . s
Bmr019_1989	He 's try No , he 's trying to get good recognition performance . ; He had the h ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_816	There 's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end ; You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_391	I I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , ; but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . ; You know , Jane ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_452	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1065	Uh - huh . ; uh , sum the differences ? ; OK . ; So .
Bsr001_2227	I don't know . ; I mean , it 's difficult because you want it to be real speech , right ? ; And also it 's not clear how well people can even adjust to even adjust to that kind of rule . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1260	I I assume you also changed some boundaries . ; Mmm . I did . ; Right ? ; So , if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation , then we can't use them in the current way we do scoring .
Bro026_303	Second . ; Ri - right now it 's second . ; Um . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_411	The reading task is a lot shorter . ; That was cut by fifty percent . ; And the reading , ; nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people .
Btr002_2923	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about because the whole subject has changed . ; And then everybody talks at once .
Bmr008_1660	Yeah . ; OK . ; And so I mean coming back to Jose 's question , ; I mean there 's still this issue of of of how much time
Bro018_1130	Yeah . ; So why were you getting forty - one here ? ; Is this ; Um .
Bmr006_1061	So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in in in in
Bmr007_1164	I 'll try to phrase it in passive voice . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , ; Technical stuff .
Bed004_149	I 'm really sort of out of it . ; OK , the uh lessons learned . ; The reading needs to be shorter . ; Five minutes is just too long .
Bro026_51	So , actually everybody who 's working on it will be up there for at least a little while . ; So they 'll remotely access it from there . ; So has Has anybody tried remotely accessing the CVS using , uh , uh , SSH ? ; Yeah .
Bro011_747	It 's a free software ? ; Uh , Octave ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah it 's it 's it 's free .
Bdb001_472	But it but that sounds ; Since they are developing a big ; But that 's ; I don't think that 's a big deal .
Bmr014_83	Uh , um . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about ; because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point , ; and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come ; and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out ,
Bmr014_1240	Actually , I was gonna ; Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or ; Not really . ; No .
Bro025_299	Yeah . It 's not a median filtering . ; It 's just We don't take the median value . We take something ; Um , so we have eleven , um , frames . ; Oh , this is for the VAD .
Bro003_961	Are you just trying to be difficult ? ; No , ; I just don't understand . ; Well , th
Bro017_1262	right . ; He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when , ; and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up , ; Yeah .
Bro022_666	So ; So ; Yeah . ; The only difference is the features , right now ,
Bed008_1047	OK . ; Right , right . ; Yeah . ; Right , sure , OK .
Bro011_35	With Hynek ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So everybody knows what happened except me .
Bro023_1682	but ; I think we 're OK . ; So . ; OK .
Bro023_1210	Could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction ? ; Yeah , ; it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_162	And we 'll do ; Oh . ; OK , ; sure .
Bro013_343	Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it ; and um , ; Mm - hmm . ; because it it
Bed005_458	It 's it 's the It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_732	But they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think . ; OK . ; So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . ; Oh , well that 's pretty soon .
Bmr015_837	but , eh , there are a lot of peaks , ; eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . ; Um , ; Yeah .
Bro016_311	people people within this tight - knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting , uh , more or less , that these are the rules . ; Yeah . ; But , people outside of it who look in at the broader picture are certainly gonna say " Well , wait a minute . You 're doing all this standing on your head , uh , on the front - end , ; when all you could do is just adjust this in the back - end with one s one knob . "
Bmr002_214	I 'm wearing it around my neck . ; which may be different than wearing it on the head . ; OK . ; So , basically they 're kind of like sentences but with n numbers instead of words .
Bmr019_1507	And got some very impressive results , um , with , you know , discriminative , uh , Gaussian training . Um , you know , like , um , error rates go from I don't know , in very noisy environment , like from , ; uh , uh ; I for now I OK , now I have the order of magnit ; I 'm not sure about the order of magnitude .
Bro019_1584	or ? ; It 's Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_128	Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who 's filling out the answers . ; I want it to be self - evaluating . ; You can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_31	And I think that 's fine . Putting it in question marks is better than doing it wrong . ; The big problem was , they had the wrong number of beeps in it . ; Oops . ; So it didn't align .
Bro017_266	Hmm . ; Exactly , that 's what yeah , that 's what it is . ; Hmm . ; Because if you run this uh recognition , you get you still get about twenty percent error
Bmr012_1178	Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there ; you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , ; right ? ; No that 's uh
Bmr002_1093	Yeah . ; but I 'm I 'm just saying that ; Oh , not right now , ; but I mean in the future .
Bro026_44	I see . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , Pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast .
Bmr007_498	Now if it 's just backchannels , people may be doing that with less intention of being heard , just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels , ; in which case that those might there may be no upper bound on those . ; I I have a feeling that backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard , uh , don't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural I think , to backchannel if in a multi - audience you know , in a multi - person audience . ; If you can see them , actually .
Bed008_248	Also true or false . ; Mm - hmm . ; No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr018_709	Unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business . ; Right , but that 's I mean , that was our plan , ; Yeah , right . ; but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time .
Buw001_326	Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad ; It ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_143	but then we we should firm it up by next next Thursday 's meeting . ; Will we have time to , um , to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the IBM transcribers by then , ; or ? ; Oh yeah .
Bro022_1184	and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal . ; Yeah ? ; And ; So I expect it If if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to it to , uh , be a better model of speech .
Bro008_78	and ; and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some , uh , combination of things . ; Um , if , uh ; Cuz there 's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing .
Bro023_734	Mm - hmm . ; Like , you estimate the edge of square ; and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_511	Um , well , I 'm gonna f work with TIMIT ; With TIMIT . OK . ; TIMIT uh , phone recognition with TIMIT . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1244	Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features . ; Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it ; but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_768	Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; We were th ; But uh I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that .
Bmr028_1701	w instead of channelizing and having the , uh , uh , you know , elaborate coding of the backchannels . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . You could still eh ; Yeah . There 's eh the s the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue .
Bsr001_1209	Right . ; But that I don't really know . ; That 's what I heard from Morgan , ; Yeah , I know .
Bed013_626	Oh . Cool . Keith . ; He he decided I 'm chilling in the five - one - O . ; Cool , " cool Keith " . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_380	That must have been suspenseful . ; That was very suspenseful . ; Watching the disk meter . ; That was that was the most excitement I had all weekend .
Bro004_1366	I mean , I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight . ; There 's there 's there 's gonna be debugging hassles ; and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . ; But . Notice how I said somebody
Bmr003_2217	that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and and and you 're live . ; Oh , then it comes on . ; I see , I see . ; OK ,
Bmr008_372	Yeah , right . ; That 's right . ; Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_813	Yeah . ; Well there 's there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . ; Anyway yeah , so we 'll we 'll look at this . ; And . So , all of these issues now are now starting to come up .
Bed010_212	And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially , ; Yeah . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr027_600	I mean , because they they filled out a contact information ; and that 's where I 'm sending the information . ; Right . ; And so far everyone has done email .
Buw001_1834	And so it depends , ; w e e e ; they 're you know , they 're p m ; If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh , major communications between Dan and UW folks
Bro014_43	Um , ; so what I was started playing with was the th again , this is the HTK back - end . ; And , um , ; I was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through about four sort of rounds of of training .
Bmr002_367	It 's just I haven't transcribed in in awhile . ; The problem is The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals , ; I mean ; Right .
Bmr011_441	Fine . ; Good . ; Uh , he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , uh , or he might have no interest whatsoever . ; I I just really don't know .
Bed002_569	Right . ; But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there . ; Mm - hmm . ; So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well .
Bmr006_729	Yeah . That 's interesting . ; Yeah , acoustic with this . With with , yeah , the background . ; Yeah , fans . ; This is like a ground level , with It 's not it 's not total silence .
Bro023_1091	Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering . ; am I right ? ; Sorry . ; Well , it 's some kind of Wiener filtering
Bmr024_401	OK . ; We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them . ; Well , we we we wanna have them . ; You mean there 're more than ten ?
Bmr031_504	We should warn them that these disk space issues are gonna creep up on them very fast . ; uh , if they ; Yep . Yep . ; They 'll have to start kicking people out of the meetings ,
Bdb001_959	Oh , well . ; so . ; Um , ; so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what ,
Bmr010_214	Yeah . ; Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . ; Is there a a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? ; No .
Bed003_815	You 're not allowed to . ; Yeah . ; Unless you are , whatever , his his divorce lawyer or something . ; Yeah .
Bed014_345	So um ; you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those ; and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th ; hopefully turns out to be consistent ,
Bed010_1081	That would have been i my guess . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Um , But anyway , yeah .
Bed009_1098	Oh , OK . ; Uh , OK , ; th ; part of it comes from the ontology .
Bed010_833	and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , ; and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff . ; But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , ; Alright .
Bmr009_1086	Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north . ; Uh yeah . That 's ; But that 's also North Midland , ; Yeah .
Bed009_223	Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? ; Walk a scenic route ? ; and so forth . ; There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things .
Bro015_37	So I guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet . ; For the VAD they probably they will do something like having some kind of idealized VAD that they could run on the channel zero of the SpeechDat - Car ; and then take the same um end points and apply them on channel one ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_292	Yeah , I just wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers or something . ; Yeah . ; Then Yeah , then normalize by by something like that , ; Well , we didn't get to look at that ,
Bro014_885	so when we take we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . So there are there is this . ; There could be also the , um something like the maximum of the auto - correlation function
Bro025_223	Mm - hmm . ; uh , which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , uh , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for . ; So , um , all of that is is , uh still seems like a good idea . ; The thing is now we know some other constraints .
Buw001_1398	and ; Mm - hmm . ; I agree . ; Right .
Bns002_1360	And I uh I think my presentation is over , ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr023_912	and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen ; and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop ! ; there 's this big DC offset . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1222	That you can use it with every application ; and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network , that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom , it must be fit end to end . ; And if you assume something , like we discussed it , very hard with with Multicast , that you assume that Multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end , this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet . ; Otherwise it makes no sense ,
Bed010_1038	Yeah . ; Right . ; And you 'll get feedback from these guys . ; Great , yeah .
Bmr015_1168	uh , um , ; e a it 's not just a minor part . ; In fact , the I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful . ; So it 's critical
Btr002_1817	Yeah . Well and then , you know , there are these other things that I think are really interesting , ; like the vocal changes in character . ; People shifting into a kind of a comic voice , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_590	Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good ; because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy . ; Right , right . ; It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around ,
Bed013_618	Wha - w ; Look at the web page and let 's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon ? ; More cues for us to find it are like , neural cons ; Johno will send you a link .
Bro026_464	I mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . ; that 's ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr028_770	An - Which is the right way to do it . ; I mean , when we did our first experiments and I was , uh , creating SRI feature files from the ICSI front - end , I just had perl scripts , you know , and hacked a bunch of stuff together ; just to get it going . ; But the r the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the ICSI tools .
Bmr029_351	And whether it 's , um ; Uh , I think that 's the o actually ; and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone . ; And overlap or not .
Bsr001_1688	But , uh , just mixing the ; Yeah . ; just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously . ; And I was a little surprised .
Bro027_1133	And ; is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch ; You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_617	Uh not really , ; but also depends on uh you know , for example power relationships , and antenna relationships . ; Yeah , ; You know , eh
Btr002_61	Leah Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the transcriber interpreted it as " twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this " , ; and , um , actually what I meant to say was um , " so you 're saying groups of different sizes , ; different size groups ? " ; Whoa .
Bmr003_485	S ; Right , ; OK . ; Yeah , sp I 've been I was really pleased to see that .
Bmr027_222	So if we agreed , OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have ; Mm - hmm . Good . ; if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , ; I think we should just say that
Bed013_394	well , you can say we have done a little bit ; and that 's this , ; and uh sort of the rest is position paper , ; " we wanna also do that " .
Bed006_995	Whi - which is not bad , ; because I mean , that there 's multiple sens ; I mean that particular case , there 's mult there there 's a forced side of of that verb as well . ; Hmm .
Bns001_139	OK . ; And , despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever , uh , she found the time to um write , with what we discussed before and in the form of HTML stuff . ; And we wanna put it on the web pages in the next days . ; So , I will send an email , then , to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they 're aligned with , um , their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages .
Bmr009_1216	And that 's actually good . ; Yeah . ; I was I was thinking of something along that line ; yeah .
Bed006_1320	list all the parent categories " . ; It 's just like a frame hierarchy , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_929	but . ; Nope . ; Didn't do it . ; Oh .
Bro005_1395	OK . ; You don't have to be happy . ; You 're almost done . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro027_204	Huh . ; week and a half . ; I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester ; but they 'll do it any time , huh ?
Bro024_738	Then if we can improve the noise estimation , then it should get better . ; Yeah , ; I I started thinking about also ; I mean yeah , uh , I discovered the same problem when I started working on uh , on this Aurora task almost two years ago ,
Bro023_1494	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1278	I 'm d ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; One thing about that is that is that um in the process of of doing the word level ? it really is just as easy to put the stress in at that point .
Bmr005_1305	I mean , I 'm thinking , politically ; Stage some political debates . ; You could do this , ; Well yeah ,
Bed014_1357	and its sort of surprising . ; Yeah . ; I I I I definitely get that impression . Yeah . ; You know , like
Bed015_994	Mm - hmm . ; It doesn't always have to be the subject . ; Right . ; So again , information structure has a topic slot .
Bmr011_1492	So . ; OK . ; I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically . ; I don't know
Bed003_574	and then try to find the probability of other nodes . ; OK . ; Dat - dat - dah . ; What should I observe ?
Bed006_1667	I have several in my head , ; yeah . ; Always thinking about binding . ; Well the the the binding is technically no problem
Bed008_1481	Right . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; I don't think ,
Bmr016_2248	Mm - hmm . ; So , I was just I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr001_708	she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Ah , that 's right .
Bro012_1059	uh ; So um . ; This there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? " ; Mmm .
Bmr006_63	Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , ; both to get the , um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about ; things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . ; I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth .
Bed002_155	and do research like that . ; Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . ; And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . ; Um . There 's other work going on in meeting recording .
Bmr006_680	But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . ; I 've seen it already . ; It 's a real problem , a frequently problem uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_422	I agree . ; That 's a very good that 's a very good uh , suggestion . ; And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . ; I didn't get to that point
Bmr027_154	And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder . ; The German ones will be ready for next week . ; Those are three three of those . ; A different set of people .
Bro024_55	Um . ; So I think we 'll use as much data as we have at a particular time , ; and we 'll we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . ; But , um , there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models .
Bmr022_1271	Oh , I ; So , maybe there is a way in CVS to effectively lock something if you don't want people to make any changes ? ; At the repository level , there certainly is . ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_249	So you can say " well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency " , ; Mm - hmm . ; and what you get is then , that you get a p vector . ; And this vector can be a a s assigned to s some phoneme .
Bmr005_1115	you know . ; Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , ; and then it 's getting the sum . ; So um , uh anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try
Bmr026_928	Mm - hmm . ; Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far . ; Yeah . ; And that that that will probably help , actually ,
Bro010_940	I mean , it 's g all g ; narrow band ; uh , ; i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination .
Bmr019_566	I mean ; Well , they 're bad . ; But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ? ; Yeah . When you listen to it , uh , the PZM and the PDA Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor
Bmr023_725	like , " yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers ; and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . " ; The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard . ; And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes ,
Bmr012_699	I didn't know that actually . ; Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions , ; Yeah OK . ; say it 's OK .
Bmr020_1637	I I was very impressed with the with the result . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting , ; and and that then when you get a meeting like this or something ,
Bro027_1191	Uh , ; Yeah , uh ; Well , I ; so maybe it 's treating some things differently .
Bmr016_1990	Wait . ; I 'm sorry I 'm I didn't follow that last thing . ; So , so gloss in the same line that would have " gloss quote one one one dash one thirty " , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , uh , " curly bracket NUMS curly bracket " . ; Right .
Bed015_1552	Mm - hmm . ; Except s it 's it 's trickier than that ; because um , the reference for example ; So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things ,
Bmr002_1215	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I didn't know that . ; OK .
Bmr026_177	yeah , for a demo . ; Yeah , sounds good . ; So ; OK , so again , the issue is For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on ,
Buw001_1054	Mm - hmm . ; I just don't ; because they 're kind of a captive audience . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1193	Uh no . ; We don't have . ; Oh ! ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_1167	there was an issue of , uh , ; suppose we get in the , uh , ; I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , ; uh , where we we ,
Bro014_94	as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ? ; Yeah . It depends . ; I mean , it takes you have to do an overnight basically , the way it is set up now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1872	if the VAD said ; since the VAD is is is right a lot , ; uh ; Yeah .
Bro027_669	And now he 's he 's requiring it to be done first . ; Well , but I think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . ; Right . ; Well , so you say
Bns002_1337	because well , they probably are very happy of selling a lot of them . ; But maybe for cars . ; Yeah , if your car is the infrastructure , for instance . ; Yeah .
Buw001_19	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1379	We prune very conservatively . ; I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um we could probably tighten the pruning without really ; So we we basically we have a very open beam . ; But , you 're only talking about a percent or two .
Bmr003_2582	Cheap . ; We can start we you can make a hundred of them or something . ; Oh , of the of the boards ? ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bed010_427	I can like I c ; Um . This week I guess um , kind of I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . ; So yes , I might I can be around . ; And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days .
Bmr030_873	Cuz I was thinking that would be a good one to have . ; Non - interactive ; Ones that aren't on people 's desks . ; Well , there 's sort of .
Bed003_1333	So there , two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque . ; You know . ; Really . ; Then again , everything else is free then once you 're ins in there .
Bed015_470	So , you know , we could think of our uh , just like X - schema " walk " refers to this complicated structure , past refers to , you know , a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it . ; I think that 's exactly right . ; So so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it ; you know , having it both ways , right ?
Buw001_156	Eric on channel nine . ; Liz , on channel one . ; Mari on channel zero . ; Katrin on channel two .
Bsr001_1897	Mm - hmm . ; So so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ? ; So so we should ; That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation .
Bmr026_135	Well , that was the other point . ; Oh , was that another one ? ; Yep , that 's another agenda item . ; OK .
Bmr012_1384	s looking into the theory behind that ; and then uh hopefully I get some results . ; So it it 's a it 's a project goes over the course of one semester . ; Great .
Bed002_1235	So this is Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . ; The the full NT and the full Linux version are there . ; I 've downloaded them both , ; and I started to unpack the Linux one
Bmr022_708	They were all things that I could easily listen to and sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other , ; so . ; Yeah , it 's there . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2892	Right . ; And so I did an analysis ; and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate ; Yeah .
Bro004_335	Yeah . ; Um . The ; Yeah . ; For the PLP with JRASTA the the we
Bro028_789	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_907	or you know just ; The ; wa wasn't there supposed to be a link in the ; Right .
Bed017_504	And um , um , ; Right . ; m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . ; So " this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux " or something like this .
Bro023_1578	Uh , so I have to test it . ; Mmm . ; But are you comparing with something ; e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again ,
Bmr016_1207	and if if they actually said " because " , then it 's written as " because " with no w ; " cuz " doesn't even figure into the equation . ; Beca - because ; But but in our meetings people don't say " hey cuz how you doing ? "
Bmr020_1502	Well , we have the unintelligibility convention . ; And actually they have one also , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro015_189	but um it turns out that the one that they 're actually using was not the best , uh in in their series of experiments , which I uh Maybe it 's because they uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something . ; Sure . ; Wh - who 's they they ? ; Uh , I don't know who did it
Bro023_1099	Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1196	and if you have two pieces of ; Yeah . ; No no ; Right .
Bdb001_150	So that you can just change the time - line . ; Except the time - line is gonna be huge . ; If you say ; Yes .
Bmr014_949	No , no . ; You 're missing the point . ; Mm - hmm . ; We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this .
Btr002_1002	Uh - huh . ; Th - that backspace and the little ; Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place . ; and the th yeah , that little evil apostrophe that keeps showing up .
Bro014_353	whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these these systems working . ; So , ; um , ; I think the hope would be that it would uh , it would work well for the good cases
Bmr007_59	OK . ; What about the , um your trip , yesterday ? ; Um . ; Sort of off - topic I guess .
Bro010_870	are these something that you decide ahead of time , ; like " I 'm going to look for this particular feature ; or I 'm going to look at this frequency , " ; or
Bro010_1297	and I was I was about to read them too . ; It 's a , uh , blank sheet of paper . ; So I guess we 're we 're done . ; Yeah ,
Bed006_1174	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; OK . ; So so I I mean for for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about .
Bro019_1398	And , um , so I I been I been thinking about that ; and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , um , exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need , ; what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . ; And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I how do I get labels ?
Bmr009_1420	You like it ? ; OK . ; Yeah , I do . ; Good .
Bro018_1052	Yeah . ; And the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer ; which sort of implies that the networks are bushier , ; you know , there 's more things it 's considering
Bed003_1313	meaning " It 's way out of my budget " ; um ; There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter ? ; Um , nothing comes to mind .
Bmr020_1206	And because ; But after we 've done Thilo 's thing . ; No . ; Yes !
Btr001_1539	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; but it took a really long time and I 'd get frustrated with it . ; And I think that I would lose my
Bmr008_948	They 're r generally not very good at assessing their own abilities . ; Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it . ; but ; OK .
Bro019_210	If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make ; Just do P - make . ; and and you basically write a Make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , ; s
Buw001_1675	and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape ; and give it to a transcription service , uh , that will ; Oh , is this IBM ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_517	Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was ; but it was smaller than ours . ; Well , that might help a bit . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1141	Yeah . ; That 's what they 've been doing . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed015_1987	Yeah , uh ; Um , yeah , there should be I I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , ; yeah . ; where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents ,
Bro023_845	Mm - hmm . ; Um , doing just this , uh , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , um , t doesn't yield any improvement ; Oh ! ; Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ?
Bed008_1477	Mmm . ; right ? ; So this is what we wanna learn . ; Yep .
Bed015_1916	And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion ; but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've we really want to get done . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1236	Oh , right . ; So . ; Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ? ; Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought .
Bmr016_2107	The word . ; The word " seven " , OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_108	Yeah , but I think also u I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is , when the two speaker ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Then , that 's a problem right there . ; So . I think you should at least be able ,
Bns002_495	Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; So ; in fact , this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception , that will start in in a moment , is over .
Bro023_1528	I 'm confused . ; Mmm ? ; You said five hundred milliseconds ; but you said sixty - four milliseconds .
Bmr031_444	That 's what I was saying . ; Why are why are they asking us ? ; So so ; Yeah .
Bed012_674	And , um , we won't meet next Monday . ; So . ; Cuz of Memorial Day ? ; Yep .
Bsr001_2182	No , ; yeah . ; Yeah , ; I I mean ,
Bro010_1030	e Um , ; um , ; I mean , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff ; but that 's very similar to sonorance .
Bro014_680	And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation , ; so spectral subtraction , ; and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this . ; So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization ,
Bed002_1336	and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted , ; Yeah . ; and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality ; Right .
Bmr027_587	I don't think , uh They 're so recent , these visitors . ; I and and I they 're also so ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_872	OK . ; Good idea . ; And see if it see if it see if it feels easier to you . ; OK .
Bmr019_1452	Well , u i ; And so so you can you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do , ; but , you know , they they they had something specific . ; But , one of the reasons I have Chuck 's messing around with with the back - end that you 're not supposed to touch
Bmr007_540	Sorry , what were you saying ? ; It 's hard to do both , ; huh ? ; Um no , when when when there 's backchannel , I mean , just I was just listening , and and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person
Bmr020_1697	And there 's there 's one point which I uh yeah , which which I r we covered when I when I r listened to one of the EDU meetings , ; Great . ; and that 's that somebody is playing sound from his laptop . ; Uh - huh
Bro005_1171	But one way or another we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . ; So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that ; um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , ; which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we if they look at more constrained conditions they they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .
Bro016_1057	Um , ; this is a paper by Hubener and Cardson Benson Bernds - Berndsen . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bmr003_1678	If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yes . ; Which allows five .
Bed010_51	So , you have a basically , a goal ; and it , you know , says " OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal , ; Mm - hmm . ; so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold .
Bmr030_79	So And uh , this was the one also that was , ; uh , ; Was it with Susan Ervin - Tripp ? ; I don't remember .
Bro012_341	Hmm . ; And so . I 'll let you know what what happens with that . ; But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_6	so ; So , I got , uh these results from , uh , Stephane . ; Also , um , I think that , uh um we might hear later today , about other results . ; I think s that , uh , there were some other very good results that we 're gonna wanna compare to .
Bro027_288	Yeah . ; Or if I did ask him , he didn't reply . ; I I don't remember yet . ; Uh , I 'll I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again .
Bmr020_525	So , ; and then we looked at the disti ; so we looked at the distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall ; uh , and and and particularly at the interruption points .
Bro013_699	and um the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer ; um so he does this um method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um frequency resolution . ; So I don't really know the theory . ; I guess it 's these are called " time frequency representations "
Bed014_850	but it 's ; OK . ; D i ; That 's normal .
Bro017_607	Eh Is this in the baseline ? ; or in uh ; In the ; No ,
Bmr026_328	and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms , ; An ; Right . ; so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around .
Bmr025_95	and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , ; so the front - end is the user interface ; and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . ; And so I 've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats .
Bmr008_1053	don't forget it . ; Oh yeah , that 's bad . ; So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate . ; Thanks
Bmr018_211	Like I I mean I guess if we have to do it again anyway , ; but , uh ; Yeah . ; I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um ,
Bns001_1226	and we come to the conclusion , " OK , uh Multicast , we must deal with both approaches " , ; that you have eh application layer Multicast ; as well as maybe some other Multicast and maybe really Multicast ; and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the server elsewhere in the network you want to use any application .
Bro008_324	Mm - hmm . ; the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine uh p percent error per digit . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_505	And ; Yeah , I think what is important to see is that there is a big difference between the training modes . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1137	and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard . ; Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you is Amaretto . ; Right . ; Yep .
Buw001_1904	If I don't get something ; Who ? ; Landay or Jason ? ; Landay .
Bro011_507	then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . ; I see . ; And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength . ; And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities ,
Btr002_2227	This is this is a new experience . ; Cuz I have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while , ; but th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_245	And do you splice them into the waveform ? ; Or ? ; Yeah . He then he d I recorded Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked . ; Right .
Bed006_1101	Yeah . ; yeah that would be that would be nice . ; and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week . ; OK .
Bmr027_357	or ; That will happen . ; That will absolutely happen . ; Right .
Bed012_951	But , I mean , in the practical sense , it 's impossible . ; Right . Cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons ? ; Yeah . ; So the best - case scenario would be the number of constructions
Bro014_675	we 'll see what happen with this . ; And ; Yeah . ; So what happened since , um , last week is
Bmr002_1385	Interesting . ; Very interesting . ; Wow , ; I 'm just really impressed by this ,
Bed009_499	I mean it does matter ; because it does have to keep track of you ; we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth ; Yeah , th there there I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters .
Bmr003_982	did we ? ; I mean , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into
Bed016_271	I could hear it . ; I I can hear it . ; I heard it . ; They might not hear it in the
Bed014_261	Was it OK ? ; I did . ; Was it ? ; I I wa I was looking at it .
Bed005_531	also not very interesting , ; and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes , ; route elements , ; and , again , as we thought it 's really simple .
Bro019_834	I mean , to cleaning it up once more . ; Yeah , it might be . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro004_282	Um It 's two times , ; Yeah , um . ; actually ? ; Yeah .
Bro026_404	So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , " oh , yeah , I understand " , is is very helpful .
Bmr006_1520	the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , ; and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says " Hey Roger " or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? ; No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . ; OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .
Bro003_1967	To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and and see where everything is , ; and we 're not gonna do that . ; So , ; uh , the second class way of doing it is to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled
Bmr001_116	That 's a little bit . ; Can I have something to write on the back of ? ; So , so where are we in this ? ; Thanks .
Bmr006_404	And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert . ; Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_845	I think so . ; Yep . ; Yeah , ; y right ,
Bmr010_103	And you you might ; So there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion ; because I I thought that it was it 's interesting to look at what features are useful . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_357	Yeah . ; Yeah , I have a real problem with that . ; Well , it sh I mean it 's the same micropho ; see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting ,
Bmr008_503	OK . ; That that so that 's why I didn't have circle forms . ; but I mean . ; Because it would be different depending on what your language is .
Bmr008_1160	Yeah . ; So , I mean , for today , for instance , ; and ; this is the second meeting recorded today .
Bmr026_389	Yep . ; I have um I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . ; Alright ! ; So
Bed015_2065	Uh - huh . ; OK , that 's that 's a bit unfortunate ; So ; Yeah .
Bmr009_336	Yeah . ; maybe ; and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1080	right ? ; Yeah . ; And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe . ; Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well , uh the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one .
Bmr003_310	And so they 're applying , I think I B ; Is that right ? ; I don't know . ; Something like that .
Bmr028_1099	or is that Mathematica ? ; and and , uh , thi this , uh first result he got , uh , was really great . ; It actually , uh uh didn't exactly eliminate the reverberation , ; but it completely got rid of the speech .
Bed006_1175	right ? ; OK . ; So so I I mean for for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about . ; It can be either A , B or C .
Bmr011_1528	of Yes . Really . ; And I don't mean that they 're angry ; but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . ; So if anyone has ideas ,
Bmr019_1576	Well ; We don't even have enough channel ; Because it would be a different kind of meeting , ; Yeah .
Bro024_363	If it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same . ; It 's gonna you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gonna differ depending on the person and so forth . ; But at least the basic acoustics are gonna be the same . ; So f if it 's really in one kiosk , then I think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to
Bro022_84	I remember now . ; Yep . ; So , um . ; Have you d ?
Bed010_1007	Yep . ; E o do y ; Well , we we 're connected to uh ; Yeah .
Bro024_225	So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do . ; But then , yeah , the LDA i uh , is interesting because it would sort of say well , suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion , ; what would the filter look like then ? ; Uh - huh .
Bns002_1328	where we can have a kind of uh dual mode uh wireless network adaptor ; So if we are not able to reach any access point but we are able to reach another network node , well , maybe this network node could do me the favor to reach or to forward my packets to the access point . ; So the main idea , the driving force here , is to uh try to obtain uh , let 's say , hybrid mode ; which allows an adaptor to work either in the access point or in the eh in the ad - hoc mode in a seamless way .
Bro003_74	So um the issue is how how how would we ever accomplish that ? ; Uh ; what what what part of town do you live in ? ; Um , I live in , um , the corner of campus .
Bmr015_183	Yeah . ; But it 's just two thing ways that you can say it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Btr001_863	Mm - hmm . ; It 's not a great example , ; but you know ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_250	The medical . ; I think ; Yeah . ; but I like this .
Bro003_320	we 've got something much better than mel cepstra . ; It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . " ; OK ? And so we give them these gobbledy - gook features ; but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language .
Bsr001_1411	Well , just just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's quite an interesting issue .
Bmr010_385	which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we discussed on some methods to do it .
Bro017_1139	Yeah ? ; Because I Like , I 've noticed in the higher cepstral coefficients , the numbers seem to get smaller , ; right ? ; So d
Buw001_728	yeah , way of of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile . ; I agree . ; And if it 's simple as I mean , as simple as just the digital ; Otherwise you 'd you lose it .
Bro024_1110	I think I 'm confused . ; Well ; OK . ; Alright .
Bed006_1065	Yeah ; because they 're two different things ; one of which is l ; you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second .
Bed004_538	Ah . ; Ultimately . ; W ; Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this .
Bro021_1205	uh ; And I can calculate this . ; What is the first variable in that probability ? ; Uh , this is the Gaussian .
Bmr016_1404	Yeah . ; You say arg - C and arg - V all the time . ; That 's right . ; Yeah
Bmr006_917	Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , ; because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed011_135	That 's the data collection . ; And um And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? ; Something ? ; Yeah .
Bro024_728	because we never had any noise compensations . ; Mmm . ; So that 's where the biggest improvement came up . ; Not much in the well match and the medium match and TI - digits also right now .
Bmr011_94	I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; so , better quality close talking mikes .
Bro021_568	data that resembles read speech , ; like these digit readings , ; because he feels that the SmartKom system interaction is not gonna be exactly conversational . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2088	So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's that 's a tip off . ; That 's good . ; And then the , uh would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time . ; Uh , so this this notion of putting down the P Z Ms and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table
Bmr018_1623	But anyway , I I I think it 's it 's just the the i it 's it 's it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd came up with ; But we could talk about this stuff , ; I think this would be fun to do . ; Right .
Bro025_650	Um , it is used , uh ; Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping . ; Um , it 's used for end of utterance ; Mmm .
Bmr005_613	I thought you did forty - five minutes of ; No , forty - five minutes is the is the session , ; all the session . ; Oh , you haven't done the whole session .
Bmr019_858	I mean , if it 's if it 's ; You mean like Yeah , word start insights . ; if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags , ; Right .
Bro011_642	So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , ; but um ; i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . ; I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models
Bmr020_1288	Yeah . ; But ; But then we could just use the the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to I B ; Without having her check anything .
Bmr028_455	Nope . ; Or ? ; I think , maybe talk to him first in person ? ; That 's what I would think .
Bro024_348	Yeah . ; The way I currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds . ; So what you just said , about what do you start with , raises a question of what do I start with then ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1367	Yep . ; What was their rough what was their conclusion ? ; Yeah , read Wall Street Journal . ; It works .
Bro024_1629	What was it ? ; This ; Mm - hmm . ; this smoothing , it was over the subtraction factor , so to say .
Bmr013_814	Do the transcribers actually start wi with , uh , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? ; Well , um they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , ; OK . ; but the next , m m
Bro003_928	yeah , ; the Spanish , perhaps , ; Spanish . ; we will have .
Bmr022_814	Like , I don't mind those , ; We abs th ; but it they bounce around . ; We have lots o of choices of microphones .
Bmr031_276	Sure . ; and " Yeah ! " and s stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1271	and that 's not really what I heard . ; And that 's another thing she said . ; Cuz it 's just hard to do . ; This is This is Bever 's Bever 's effect ,
Btr001_1656	that 's the thing . ; It 's true , ; i that 's the thing that makes it harder sometimes . ; Yeah .
Bns002_817	this is during the data transmission . ; Yeah , but again again , what we are adding with this behavior is , uh uh a little bit more , probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate . ; Yeah ? ; then
Bed010_1076	Oh . is it a take - home final ? ; Yeah . ; Who 's doing this ? ; Aikin , Alex , yeah .
Bmr016_1310	now we 're about to get to the to this now , ; I have frequencies . ; So you 'll see how often these different things occur . ; But , um , uh , the very front page deals with this , uh , final c pa uh , uh , aspect of the standardization
Bmr012_383	Mm - hmm . ; I mean there 's nothing ; Right . ; There 's no language model for PZM or
Bro019_1547	It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet , ; but it was just LPC , ; and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , ; And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants ,
Bed011_475	Exactly . ; This is limiting the choices , but yeah . ; Right . ; OK , sorry .
Bmr026_1018	That 's yet s ; Yeah . ; We were probably at least a factor or two off . ; Right .
Bro023_1137	Well , do you get this musical noise stuff with Wiener filtering ; or is that only with , uh , spectral subtraction ? ; No , you get it with Wiener filtering also . ; Yeah .
Bed016_947	Just beyond that . ; How much does it cost ? ; Where is the castle ? ; Yeah .
Bro010_523	So . ; Yeah . ; Is the estimate of the noise spectrum a running estimate ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2356	uh , you say you would say like , um , ; uh like ; OK , ; so he 's laughing
Bmr013_3	So , uh ; Alright . ; Um , so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . ; Oh good .
Bmr007_1187	OK . ; so in the consent form it says , well you we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're unhappy with , yeah . ; OK , and you can say ; OK .
Bro012_251	Yeah . ; Point It 's supposed to be point six . ; Yeah . ; But changing it to point five I think is
Bmr029_862	Uh ; Say this again ? ; Sorry I missed it . ; So i in Th - the problem is that if we proceed like we just described , um , when he goes to m um , create the new s training data with his processing , he throws out some speakers .
Bed017_519	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ ; So , you 're not
Bns002_387	let me ; Maybe it 's better to to uh , draw it on the ; Oops . ; l let me
Bmr010_1470	I see . ; I see . ; in principle . ; Yeah , I mean , I
Bmr027_224	if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , ; I think we should just say that ; say that , you know , i a as um , " per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth ; " and , uh , because we w " these , uh
Bns003_252	But I I I believe , there 's a lot of potential for that . ; And we should discuss it maybe bilateral afterwards . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr025_610	I mean , his point was well taken . ; This data cannot be recovered . ; Yeah . ; And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive
Bro027_1632	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; What about using it in the neural net ? ; Yeah ,
Bns003_802	so , ; they are paying me , ; and I have to do research for them , of course . ; I have to um well , uh , reach some goals and so on .
Btr002_3139	because it 's , like , how effective is , you know , the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make . ; Yeah . ; You know , it 's not the IPA ; and it 's just , I I just sort of think , um , it 's best to leave it with " X
Bmr012_100	OK . ; Um we we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once ; but everyone does need to do it . ; And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera .
Bmr014_682	I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say " here is a here is " ; I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? ; and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " . ; I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .
Bro014_1202	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1242	No . ; No , no , no . ; so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . ; That 's That 's fine .
Bed002_517	If i if Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah . ; Yeah . ; But it wouldn't . ; OK .
Buw001_1129	But ; n ; Hello . ; Dan here .
Buw001_899	Right ? ; And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries ; and are we gonna do anything about that . ; Well , before we leave the CrossPads and and call it done .
Bmr010_1432	so that you 're not trying at every time interval . ; OK . ; And so those are the putative places where he tries . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1273	And it was a problem , uh , with the scale . ; Eh , the scale . ; With what ? ; Scale .
Bdb001_699	So , you want to be s you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But the phrase is not part of the sentence
Bro010_278	And it felt to , uh , the users that it was instantaneous . ; I mean , as fast as talking to a person . ; It th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay . ; Yeah ,
Bed016_360	OK ? ; Yeah . ; which , ; uh , actually , i i
Bmr012_1236	So they 're still working . ; Pretty close , ; Wow . ; I j and this I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something
Bro027_333	So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters .
Bed010_172	OK . ; So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . ; And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement . ; That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,
Bed009_323	Mm - hmm . ; There are only three possibilities and the uh ; what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_37	that 's uh much more comfortable . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro004_1312	Yeah . ; Yeah , well . ; But ; Yeah .
Bro017_1065	right . ; So if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_560	Mmm . ; Well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at . ; Yeah . ; So it 's pretty much the same problem ,
Btr001_2376	Huh . ; Yeah . ; It 's possible , ; now what I 'm thinking
Btr002_3127	B but y t finish your point . ; So , y ; Oh ! I was just I was just saying that , um , I I can I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced . ; Yes .
Bed002_530	They wanna go there . ; That 's what they say , is , " Where is it ? " . ; Where is that damn thing ? ; And the parser would output
Bmr020_993	so what is the sort of how tight are they ? ; Uh , it looks much better . ; Yeah . ; Looks good .
Bmr002_1369	Five . ; We have five of the wireless . ; Oh , OK . ; OK .
Bmr006_1725	Yeah . ; I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two ; Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and ; Why do you have to know his name ?
Bed017_292	Uh , ; I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , ; I should say . ; Yeah .
Bro011_493	Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . ; Right . ; For the full band . ; But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is
Bed008_821	I I don't yet know how to do this , ; I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties ; and we don't know what they are yet . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_685	Loose . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and if it got touched , it would s it would send an impulse ,
Bro003_305	Because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set . ; Right ? ; And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_348	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 'm just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ? ; Hmm ?
Bed006_874	Hmm . ; and that that may or may not be what you guys intended . ; But if it is , then the top block is sort of like ; um , you know , you have to list exactly what X - schema
Bmr031_488	i ; You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere . ; If people are doing a wide range of things , ; doing location ,
Bmr008_920	It it gets into a can of worms . ; Well , you ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , the more you ask , the more you realize that you 're not getting great answers to what you 're asking and
Bro012_726	So there are clearly are spectral effects . ; Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies . ; But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way . ; The reason I put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different .
Bed016_320	I was like , " where 'd you get that ? " ; Yeah , that looks familiar . ; OK . ; " Looks familiar . "
Bed008_16	Oh , ; so there you go . ; Anyway , so my idea f for today ; and we can uh decide that that isn't the right thing to do
Bmr028_495	I mean , they they were people who didn't have accounts at ICSI , ; so they 're they 're harder to find . ; Well , not the ones that ; Are you su ? Are you sure ?
Bed011_341	OK . ; And y and always ; But well th but you did say something important , which is that um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with the simple cases for quite a while . ; Yeah .
Bed003_608	I forgot to uh ; Ach ! ; I 'd like to do that again . ; One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this .
Bmr010_854	when ; So , um , ; Hmm . ; if they laugh between two words , you you 'd get it in between the two words .
Bmr010_771	Right . ; It 's sort of ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bro011_68	Was there any conclusion about that ? ; Uh " try it " . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bmr002_199	Shall I n ; or d ? ; I 'd like to hear one ; Let her fill it out and go ahead and read .
Bns002_1032	eh of course , uh these uh two approaches can be can be uh somehow mixed ; and some hybrid proposals are also on the on the paper , ; and eh ; these proposals are are trying to get the advantages of both uh mechanisms
Bed002_1169	Yeah . So in terms of of the , um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . ; You don't You know , you don't really like it . ; So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . ; We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format ,
Bmr016_2037	Master copies of superset . ; When things change then the the script will cham change ; but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things . ; Good .
Bsr001_505	We could ; Yeah , ; those are pretty bad . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_3298	I 'm getting down to like the really eensy - weensy stuff . ; But , um , once I found a comment that , uh , in in curly brackets about mumbling . ; And , um , ; i g
Btr001_615	Eh . Yeah . ; You know what ? ; There might be a gender thing there , though , too , ; Yeah .
Bro024_1181	well , the reference alignment . ; Because right now I just use an alignment obtained from from a system trained on channel zero . ; And ; I checked it a little bit
Bro021_1358	OK . ; Well , I guess we 're about done . ; Um , ; so some of the digit forms don't have digits .
Bmr021_911	Yeah . ; Did you try uh ; It was mostly MSG , PLP , RASTA . ; I see .
Bro003_418	I don't know anything about Finnish . ; well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family . ; But they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1356	So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . ; I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , ; just by looking at at papers and status reports . ; Hmm .
Bro014_1465	I don't know ; w ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_299	Right , just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line , ; and number of digits in a group , ; and the pattern of groupings . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_813	And , um , ; you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately ; and and the focus on reliability . ; He expressed a lot of interest in reliability .
Bed002_253	For whatever reason that may be . ; What 's it what 's it made out of ? ; Um , r red limestone . ; So maybe you would wanna touch it .
Bro011_590	And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case , ; and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . ; So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits ; and a fixed length model for all of them
Bro024_219	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; as I was saying , I think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything , but just to do some sort of , uh , uh , hamming or Hanning , uh , kind of window , kind of thing , ; Right .
Bro023_1590	Oh , you 're not doing this with our system ? ; In i I 'm not ; No , no . ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_127	You didn't try to find speech ? ; No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel ; um sampled ten minutes randomly . ; Right , OK .
Bro014_1112	Yeah . ; Uh , yeah . ; It 's the ratio . ; Um .
Bsr001_2272	Yeah . ; Right . ; Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before ; but I think it it it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done .
Bro019_207	Yeah . ; Um , ; but uh , you can also ; If you have that level of parallelization um , and you don't wanna have to worry about writing the logic in in a Perl script to take care of that , you can use um , P - make
Bro019_377	I just found that I have to reduce the value ; I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . ; That 's all I found ; So I have to .
Btr001_2664	Yes . ; Yeah . ; and sometimes they say " zero " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_465	I thought it was eighty ; Oh , OK , ; eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six . ; Eighty - three point six .
Bro019_1508	Um , ; it 's ; Well , um , it I don't think it directly relates . ; Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi
Bed014_1030	so why don't we plan to meet Monday ; Mmm . ; and we 'll see if we want to meet any more than that . ; OK .
Bmr026_533	So the question is where are you gonna hang them ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room . ; Right .
Bmr027_937	and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , ; but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , ; because then , you know , they 're they they have a it it 's in a category , ; it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking ,
Bmr009_325	and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way , ; because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it . ; No prayer . ; That You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .
Btr002_3158	you know ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's it was only set up for
Bns001_1725	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and then get rid of SDH . ; There 's the problem is is , you see that the providers eh have always there broken view for for the management .
Bmr010_1177	is we would take , ; um , da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation ; and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , you 'd break up the word , uh , into five equal - length pieces ; which is completely gross .
Btr002_465	Good . ; But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel ; Yes . ; is , uh is much more common .
Bed011_446	you know , any of that stuff . ; uh You know , " Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning ? " ; Yeah . ; So yeah I th that seems pretty straight forward .
Bmr006_1238	Yep . ; Yeah . ; But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , ; No .
Bmr013_433	And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone ; and and , you know . You could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth . ; But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , ; um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .
Bro010_714	and ; Oh , yeah , ; sure . ; It 's the same .
Bmr022_850	Yeah , that 's right . ; So should I just go do that ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr028_925	Mmm . ; you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the far - field micropho signal . ; Yeah . ; N well , but you can use the
Bsr001_2367	d ; yeah . ; If you definitely shouldn't use your last sample . ; Right .
Bro003_36	Um And then uh Another topic I had was that uh uh Uh Dave here had uh said uh " Give me something to do . " ; And I I have I have uh failed so far in doing that . ; And so maybe we can discuss that a little bit . ; If we find some holes in some things that that someone could use some help with , he 's he 's volunteering to help .
Bmr011_92	Alright , why don't we start off with this , ; u u ; I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1843	I I want to introduce the word " snot - head " into the conversation at this point . ; We can have ; You wanna word that won't be recognized ? ; You see , cuz uh , cuz
Bmr022_419	But it sounds like a k a a a short conversation with Brian might be might be helpful to get a sense of what 's going on . ; Yeah . I 'll I 'll I 'll write him an ; Yeah , the numbers are a good idea . ; Yeah .
Bed005_287	Where it gets that from ; It 's correct , ; but I don't know where it gets it from . ; " See " .
Bed002_879	Well , we 'll see what people do . ; There 's no ; OK , so it 's just like , " Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances " . ; Yeah , and and we will record both sides .
Bmr019_607	and we 've talked about this in other contexts ; we want to have the ability to feed it different features . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK .
Bmr026_794	And , the ; But a percent and a half ? ; That 's ; Yeah , it 's pretty impressive .
Bed015_1040	you know , the room ; th but they would be represented in this list somehow . ; And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . ; Um , it should be either category or in or instance .
Bmr019_1435	Oh , you don't like HTK ? ; Yeah . ; I don't h I don't have any stock in HTK or Entropic or anything . ; No . I mean , this it it 's the HTK that is trained on a very limited amount of data .
Bed013_460	and we write about it . ; Hmm . ; About how all of these things ; What 's the part that 's not pretend ?
Bed012_751	Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days . ; This week ? ; So , this week , yeah . ; OK .
Bmr028_327	It is , for prototyping and user interface . ; It 's just really the language is awful . ; There you go . ; Oh .
Bed003_990	Maybe another thing that uh ; But I mean its interface is not the greatest . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1520	But you can listen to any of them . ; That 's excellent . ; Yeah . ; He also has version control which is another nice
Bns002_689	this is the deployment area of or or node , ; and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here , well maybe these nodes in this area , cannot reach the nodes on this other area . ; OK ? ; Uh , so what can we do to avoid this ?
Bmr031_1160	actually , I wanted to say off - line with you about any literature reviews I should do beforehand . ; " War and Peace . " ; " War and Peace . " ; That 's a good choice .
Bmr003_683	Yeah i ; s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that that are you know , and and stuff like , you know , how much ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bro003_780	OK . ; And , ; um , ; oh yeah ,
Bns003_908	he didn't answer , because he still had mentioned that there 's some minor funding , that I think would help , ; for instance , to have initial meeting either here or in Europe or or wherever . ; I 've , uh , contact one more time the professor , ; what is his name ?
Bmr011_500	Wow . ; And it 's and , um , ; in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing ; and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff ,
Bmr002_966	Yes , T " Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions . ; Yeah . ; It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . " ; Cool .
Bmr013_140	What do you mean , the prosodics ? ; H how do ; Um , just what we were talking about with grouping . ; That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end .
Bmr008_143	But but but it 's gonna depend on who 's ; And this particular form ; I know . ; So , this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker ,
Bmr021_507	but we should definitely double check on it . ; Yeah like like the same meeting shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording , looked , to the backup software , as if they had been written , you know , every single night , i for f you know , a week in a row , ; Yeah . ; Every night .
Bmr020_989	I think Jane tightened these up by hand . ; OK , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed004_260	so . ; Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to ; We 're already ; Yeah .
Bmr016_362	Yeah . ; and so you don't get ; Same same acoustics , ; same microphone ,
Bns002_377	Yeah . ; It is a reservation mechanism , ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr019_168	And then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses . ; And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances , ; and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent . ; So , it 's , um that 's the number there .
Bmr015_807	I mean that 'd that 'd be nice ; but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . ; Um , I mean cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_43	There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before ; but I don't think everyone here has seen all of this . ; So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . ; Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are
Bmr008_1409	Yeah . ; But ; even if you make a mistake occasionally , that that i is roughly i is there some corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if if uh if you ; right
Bed011_86	No . ; you didn't . ; OK . We were gonna put this in front of people . ; They give us some information on themselves .
Bmr006_743	I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , ; Whew ! ; Great . Great . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_300	Uh , he didn't know what to say , about , what is the sequence of phones there . ; They came up with some compromise . ; Because that really wasn't what it look like . ; Right .
Bmr021_613	So . ; I Actually I was gonna do a global search - replace on all entries at at ICSI ; Everybody will use it . ; Yeah .
Bro005_578	Variances . ; Yeah . ; But ; Is it i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances ,
Bmr005_1014	I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know ; maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty , ; but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits . ; Right .
Bed008_513	Mm - hmm . ; it 's not either or ; mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1403	It 's not that hard . ; disfluency tagging , ; um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . ; And Mari 's also interested in it ,
Btr002_1852	And he got to transcribe this meeting . ; Yeah , ; And there was all this meta stuff about ; that was fun .
Bmr025_679	Hmm ! ; Good . CrossPads ? ; CrossPads ? ; Uh got an email from uh James Landay
Bed014_1228	OK . ; That - that 's not that 's not saying it 's bad , ; it 's just that ; Right . Right . No . Of course .
Bns001_1514	but I don't know ; you know , I 'm not an application expert , ; I ; We have some content .
Bro018_434	But I think for for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um I think that ICSLP and Eurospeech are much more targeted . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; And then there 's these other meetings , like HLT and and uh ASRU
Bro003_1047	Well , so ; I mean , ; so i it doesn't increase the number of trainings . ; No , no ,
Bed006_1495	Maximum incompetence ; and then you can throw them up the stairs ; Yeah . ; Alright .
Bed003_1101	so this is probably ; The other thing is it is in Java ; Yeah , it 's ; Yeah .
Bed003_1713	I haven't done it yet . ; Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . ; Oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult things . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1605	OK . ; But the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires a a noise estimate . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_546	u ; And if you if you look ; is that fifty percent improvement ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2267	uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated ; and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions . ; OK . ; But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing
Bmr020_1344	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they listen to each section and say " yes , no " whether that section is ; And erase
Bro003_1506	Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there . ; And then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others . ; Mmm . ; That 's the idea .
Bed013_396	and uh sort of the rest is position paper , ; " we wanna also do that " . ; Which is not too good . ; Might be more interesting to do something like let 's assume um , we 're right ,
Bmr003_2123	That 's good . ; There we go ; s ; And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic .
Bed013_1443	Can a do more funky stuff . ; Sure . ; Yeah , I 'll have to look more into that data . ; Is that around ?
Bmr009_109	Yeah . Yeah . ; Then , that 's a problem right there . ; So . I think you should at least be able , ; Oh yeah .
Bmr019_1203	And then there 's a then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts . ; That is Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels . ; So you you id identify by some criterion , ; which is pause length
Bsr001_239	Mmm . ; but that 's a @ @ fine . ; I think we have to add that to the to the form they sign . ; I mean
Bro004_317	OK . Well . We we we may just need to uh ; So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , ; and going to a different language um ; It doesn't seem to matter
Bed004_591	This is uh ; so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the X - schema ? ; For for for ; Yes .
Bmr031_558	You 'll have to just work on little subsets of it . ; There 's just no way you could get it all . ; We 're we 're estimating that ours ; if we collect say a hundred meetings
Bro014_955	Yeah . ; I mean , uh , what I 'm arguing is that that that 's givi you gives you your intuition . ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_971	So it 's not just a particular word 's ; OK , so the you 're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to sorry , a few specific cues to some intention . ; You can dynamically look up keys , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1818	No , not default . ; Well , as it comes back , we have a uh when we can use the channelized interface for encoding it , then it 'll be easy for us to handle . ; Yeah . ; But but if if out of context , they can't tell if it 's a channeled speak uh , you know , a close - miked speaker or not , then that would be confusing to them .
Bro012_151	Yeah . ; It 's not the square . ; OK . ; Uh . What else wh what 's what else is going on ?
Bed015_261	Right , right . ; That 's the idea . ; Yeah . ; Yeah yeah .
Bmr008_1334	Yeah . ; I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different ; and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_1912	Oh , she 's here . ; I haven't seen most of them . ; I haven't either . ; She 's got a nice voice .
Bro010_132	Yeah . ; Um , ; so we will try also to add a nice downsampling ; having a filter that that
Bmr030_255	Audio . ; Yeah . ; And the stylized F - naught features are pretty cool . ; Hmm .
Bmr028_1475	So , segment whether you have segmentation or not , is it male or female or not Um , do you know the signal - to - noise ? ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Like , that 's another one I see all the time , where you assume it 's known .
Bed002_269	So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . ; So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some ; Uh , I didn't look through all the data . ; um , and there there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people uh , the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place .
Bed010_847	Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh ; It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . ; So . It 's always been out of phase ; but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that .
Bns002_717	but this is this is a way that it is it is being explored by other researchers , ; but not not uh , by me . ; But uh , there is , uh one , at least one person who is who is doing what they call " topology control " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_427	So , uh , what was the date there ? ; Monday ; or ? ; No , no , no .
Bmr003_1030	So that 's three that 's three hours . ; D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for uh , TV ? ; OK . ; Right .
Bro027_1114	it 's i All the noises are from the TI - digits , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; So you i
Bmr019_35	Talk about aligning people 's schedules . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_174	Right . ; Right . ; So at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr026_372	What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? ; Yep . ; I see Oh , I see . ; Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten ,
Bmr009_1002	Well . ; Well just a little ; You know , it doesn't have all the detail , ; but you sort of
Bmr013_694	They might be OK . ; OK . ; It you know it really depends on a lot of things , ; Yeah .
Buw001_365	But I think I think thinking about queries is a little bit dangerous right now . ; And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , ; but ; Right .
Bmr020_1561	They 'll just listen . ; Yeah . ; It 's just wasted time . ; Yeah .
Bro012_989	Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero . ; And so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw everything . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well .
Bro012_1065	and you inc incorporate the different V A ; And it looks like the the French VAD is actually uh better significantly better . ; Improves the baseline ? ; Yeah .
Bro024_1704	Right . ; Um . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I think when
Bmr028_872	Yes . We could we could try tha ; Cuz you have scores for that for the other case . ; Right . ; Right . Exactly .
Bmr001_139	and then that 's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there . ; And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that so that it 's not open to fiddling . ; So that 's what 's gonna happen . ; Right .
Bmr021_810	It 's actually more sophisticated than ROVER ; but it 's ; Um , here I got forty - eight point five ; and here I got forty - six point five .
Bro027_523	median . ; Mmm . ; Forty ; And then forty
Bro024_299	No , but those are all different people with different I mean , i in y ; So for instance , in in the in a telephone task , these are different phone calls . ; So you don't wanna @ @ chain it together from a from a different phone call . ; OK ,
Bed013_1144	That it has a location or something like that ? ; or th the ontology will tell us where actually it is located ? ; No . Not at all . ; OK .
Bed010_461	So uh ; but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it . ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1692	Um . ; Anything else that ; I a a Actually started out this this field trip started off with with , uh , Stephane talking to Hynek , ; so you may have you may have had other goals , uh , for going up ,
Bro019_747	Yeah . ; Uh , it 's not guaranteed . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro025_306	and we take th the third . ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_177	Oh , no . ; You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , I 'd imagine . ; So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something . ; Right .
Bro018_848	Uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did ; but with the mel cepstral features . ; Sort of , you know , back up from the system that he had . ; I thought he said he was gonna
Bmr025_634	Yeah . ; Uh but we do need more disk . ; So we can get more disk . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_122	And , again I want to emphasize this is just one particular um one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but I , um I took the coding of the ; I , you know , my I had this script figure out , um who was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in a two - person overlap , I didn't look at the ones involving three or more . ; And , um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who who else , ; and if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom , you get the totals for an individual .
Bmr009_238	Yeah . ; much as you 've plotted them here , ; You know , but just but just just uh do it ; Yeah .
Bro014_597	Right ? ; I g ; What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ? ; Yeah .
Bns001_1224	And if you assume something , like we discussed it , very hard with with Multicast , that you assume that Multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end , this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet . ; Otherwise it makes no sense , ; and we come to the conclusion , " OK , uh Multicast , we must deal with both approaches " , ; that you have eh application layer Multicast
Bns002_1220	Yeah . ; In the RSM band . ; S ; And the good thing is that now , especially with the new version , all you
Bmr018_1249	So it 's really supposed to go more like this than like this . ; Yes , exactly . ; But then isn't that going to ; That that that tilts ,
Bed002_896	Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? ; You wanna m have it more more steps , sort of ? ; Yeah , I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction ; I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system .
Bed002_326	Nuh ? ; " I need to get to " . ; Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . ; And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered .
Bmr011_950	Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_595	Yeah , ; and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning , ; Oh . ; when really they 're both silence .
Btr002_1615	Like ; the very beginning . ; Yeah , in the very beginning . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr031_95	So wha what 's up with IBM , Chuck ? ; Do you know ? ; Um , I think Brian is on vacation now ; but , uh , before he left we gave him , uh , another set of meetings to give to the transcribers .
Bed011_625	I mean this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing . ; He sort of had it in there . ; " Who is the the tour is the person ? " ; So it might be a tourist ,
Bmr019_160	Um . ; A a a couple percent or some ; I mean ; Well , I don't know it Overall
Bed015_1610	um , you know , you say something like or or I was thinking you can say something like , " oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican " or something like that . ; Where as in English you would say , " I thought you were " . ; Right . ; Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there ,
Bns001_1602	Yes . ; Can we both have together , maybe , I think it 's a little bit more easier , a discussion on Thursday ? ; I 'm out for th one a week and a half . ; So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop at Stanford
Bro004_1105	From the baseline . OK . ; I think this was I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon . ; Yeah . ; I think I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy .
Bro018_780	Right . Right . Right . ; I see . ; I wo did they compare that I mean , what if you just did phone recognition and did the reverse lookup . ; Uh .
Bmr008_1481	So then you you 'll you know ; hamming window . ; Something , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_467	Oh . ; In ge in in in a general point of view . ; Oh . ; OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?
Bmr012_1412	About doing some of the echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , ; so . ; Cool . ; Yeah .
Btr001_695	Yeah , ; Um ; I always adjust the time bins . ; Yeah .
Bns001_606	Mm - hmm . ; Ah ! ; And then from Nokia I came to this that project , ; Ah !
Bmr015_366	because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Or something like that ,
Bmr006_472	What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? ; Alth ; Oh , yeah . ; I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out .
Bns002_1125	Hmm . ; which include ; Yeah , we can discuss later , off - line . ; Yeah .
Bed012_288	I don't think it can handle French , ; but anyway . ; So . ; Assume we have something coming in .
Bed002_752	But It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . ; So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , ; Mm - hmm . ; there was n there was no label ,
Bmr013_441	Well , you know , um I mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , ; You know , you ; The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? ; Or do they do that on , Switchboard ?
Bro018_779	Right . ; Right . Right . Right . ; I see . ; I wo did they compare that I mean , what if you just did phone recognition and did the reverse lookup .
Bmr001_391	We figured out that it was t twelve gig twelve gigabytes an hour ? ; It was more than that . ; For for all the channels ? ; Was that with or without the
Bmr021_277	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the door - slam phone ? ; I guess , ; right , the door - slam phone .
Bmr010_352	So Brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that , uh that our ; that they are making progress ; and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription ; and
Btr001_1470	um , ; um , there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance ; and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_161	Right . ; Yeah . ; Oh ! ; And I told them , um , if he decides to use multiple examples for , um , the prosody demo , to open up separate Transcribers .
Bmr010_164	What kind of , uh , front - end processing did you do ? ; Hopefully . ; OK . ; It 's just our our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum
Bro017_380	But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down . ; So essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands . ; But if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more , ; so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much .
Bmr024_1484	the boot models are recur ; Well , mis for making things better . ; Yeah . ; But , this for making things worse .
Bmr025_611	This data cannot be recovered . ; Yeah . ; And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive ; and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup .
Btr002_2152	gesture , ; whatever . ; Right . ; That raises a question .
Bmr026_565	Which ; But this this is a very specific question for me . ; Basically , we can easily get one to four disks , ; I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it ,
Bro022_761	so , whi that shows that when the SNR decrease , uh , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for some particular noises , ; uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically . ; I i Just to clarify something for me . ; I
Bmr018_386	So you have a separate ribbon for each channel , ; There 're separate ribbons . ; and and i i it 'll be because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his with Thilo 's new procedure , ; then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins uh across the ribbons
Bmr020_1634	Yeah . ; Excellent . ; Oh , I 'd be delighted with that , ; I I was very impressed with the with the result .
Bro003_325	Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call , ; and you know , I mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh , ; uh how do you know what language it is ? ; Somebody picks up the phone .
Bmr008_286	Well , one thing , so you understand he he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ? ; Yes . ; OK , OK . ; So I 'm saying there are going to be What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data , a chunk of it will be uh , the same people many times
Bro004_1344	So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . ; And more are supposed to come soon ; and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . ; So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it ,
Bns001_1404	So ah ; the difficulty I see is that ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology . ; Which is not bad , ; but uh , I 'm just saying that it will be able It will
Bro018_63	Auto - correlation ? ; Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that ; Ye - Well that 's the variance , ; but if you just say " what is "
Bed015_2220	Oh , you already told me no . ; One , ; But we can do four . ; OK , it 's fine .
Bmr018_1335	right . ; Yeah . ; But it sounded like they were pretty well thought out ; Yeah , th that 's true .
Bns002_527	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1367	Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , I shouldn't say that . ; I have no clue .
Bmr027_700	Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk . ; You have to do all You could just do it in that time period , though , ; Well ; but I guess it 's a pain .
Bmr020_1713	but ; That 's life . ; It 's a little bit confusing . ; Yeah .
Bro022_990	Mmm . ; Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ? ; Yeah . ; So , to get something that 's would be closer to what you tried to do with Wiener filtering .
Bed002_713	and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . ; So , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry , ; except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . ; So our job is to figure out how to solve these problems .
Bro012_1300	we used we d did some of this stuff . ; Uh I I did , some years ago , ; Yeah . ; and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different
Bmr021_86	You know , pretty ; um , and then get duplicates . ; Hmm . ; I mean , there 's no problem with that .
Bed006_1297	Which is why I would think you would say Enter ; and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to Enter . ; And then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well . ; And that 's why the bindings become useful .
Btr001_1866	they agreed . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right , ; Mmm .
Bmr002_297	And that doesn't matter ; cuz I think there was probably an a uh y an indication that that I was interested in advance ; Oh . ; Yeah . That would be m That would be my fault .
Bmr021_872	But the good news is that even with this with the ICSI system being that much worse , you still get a win out of combining the two . ; So that gives some hope for the future . ; Um . ; Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation ,
Bmr024_1133	And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , ; after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . ; OK . ; NW ?
Bmr019_384	But you could if you want . ; Yeah . At any rate , I don't know if w ; I don't know . ; And Andre - Andreas , your your microphone 's a little bit low .
Bed005_441	It sho it creates this , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; " Confirm Goodbye " .
Btr002_2372	or whether he was meaning it in conversat ; Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue . ; Mm - hmm . ; But then sometimes it was more ambiguous .
Bro011_536	Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately ; so that would be a little more like what he did . ; Um . ; But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's um setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band .
Bed016_319	Oh . ; I was like , " where 'd you get that ? " ; Yeah , that looks familiar . ; OK .
Btr002_2564	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then there 's the other kind which sounds similar , ; but it 's really part of a laugh .
Bmr009_915	No , either way is fine ; I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to . ; Alright yeah , I was comparing ; so th this is So I was looking at the change first .
Bro025_230	so we have to be a little conscious of that . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; So there 's the neural net issue .
Buw001_366	And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , ; but ; Right . ; We don't even know what
Bed011_9	Yeah , let 's get started . ; Um Hopefully Nancy will come , ; if not , she won't . ; Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every uh ,
Bro012_299	For for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . ; And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four ; and um it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases ; and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched
Bmr025_215	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; And you have to have all the o ; But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf
Bmr023_427	I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks ; Yeah . ; just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating ; Yeah .
Bro023_1692	Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; For this it might help ,
Bro024_1363	Yeah , ; the that was my idea . ; I mean , if if it ha if it is not the same labeling which is taking the spaces . ; Yeah .
Bro007_237	S sentences . ; Some sets have five hundred sentences , ; so . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1948	Mm - hmm . ; All the other ones were five percent , ; the ; I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now ,
Bmr031_124	So we gave them four meetings before he left ; and , um , ; that 's it . ; So , um , I don't think we 'll hear from him before he gets back .
Buw001_172	PZA - right ; PDA - right , ; PDA - left . ; OK .
Bmr019_1037	There you go . ; But there are fewer I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_907	uh ; the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices . ; So it it ac ; the covariance matrix of the noise .
Bmr024_1549	and I 'm not sure why . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I 'll keep working on it . ; But the what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll Absinthe will be a good machine .
Bro017_285	Because there are some reasons I can I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands , ; and also experiments with release of masking , which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands . ; And ; Well how do you how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ?
Bed015_97	So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , ; often a human . ; Right ? ; So if I you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I
Bro022_99	Right . ; Well , I was , ; um , ; I think one of the perplexing problems is ,
Btr002_1452	and so I use that sometimes . ; So , on the on that on that bar you were describing . Clicking ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_656	but you may as well . ; I but but ; what uh I mean , can you spare like a minute or two of a ; Sure . Sure . Sure .
Bro027_1982	for the Meeting meeting ? ; Yeah , that 's just cuz of something on campus . ; Ah , ; OK ,
Bro028_392	that 's not what we 're used to hearing , ; and is , um ; It 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_420	I we don't know what they are yet . ; So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether ; Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . ; Now , they may wanna call that part of context .
Bed012_965	across , uh lots of different neurons , to specify different values ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , yeah , but there 's , like , a certain level of ; There 's a bandwidth issue ,
Bmr002_1446	That must be it . ; That that makes sense , ; That 's it ! ; right ?
Bed006_793	I 'm not it 's hard for me to exactly s ; So basically that will store the the object that is w ; the Source will store the object that we 're going from , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_550	Now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour . ; What 's this idea of " next tour " ? ; I mean ; It 's sort of next day ,
Bmr029_110	Do you remember ? ; Hmm . Uh . ; I don't know , ; something something like something between thirty and fifty hours , maybe .
Bro021_1119	And for that , well , the goal is to obtain , um est estimate a PDF for the noisy speech ; when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech . ; Mmm ? ; And when w
Bro011_606	Mm - hmm . ; And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um ; how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up uh th you know , the model for " one " , which wants to have nine states , you know , ; what is the uh what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ?
Bmr021_30	Um , ; Me too . ; So do I . ; I prefer these ,
Bmr020_722	Right ? ; The same the same as the mailing list , ; and ; Yeah ,
Bro003_1372	I 'm sorry , ; Labels . ; I have a p I had a problem with the pronunciation . ; I 'm sorry ,
Bed008_404	Yeah , all all of these ; if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things ; Right . ; So here here 's what it looks like to me .
Bro021_711	and it seems to be , like , somewhere ; OK . ; some silly stuff . ; And , um , the other thing , uh , was , uh , uh
Bmr012_506	cuz I think the their language models are quite different ; so ; and I I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel . ; Right .
Bro007_476	We lost time uh Wednesday maybe because that the difference in the time may be is a long different of the time . ; E excuse me ? ; Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in Europe . ; Yeah .
Bro012_314	Yeah . ; So it was like it was a better match . ; I think you know if we make a better silence model I think that will help a lot too ; um for a lot of these cases
Bmr018_458	That 's actually what I thought of , loading the chopped up waveforms , I mean , you know , that that would make it faster ; An ; So ; Hmm .
Bro026_254	mmm , then the downsampling , ; And then uh ; downsample , ; DCT ,
Bed013_1093	We wanted something that represents uncertainty uh we in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is , for example . ; Some generic information . ; OK . ; And so this is prototypically @ @ found in the " where is something " question , surface structure ,
Buw001_1498	Hmm . ; You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people . ; Yep . ; In fact , they 're very meaningful
Bro026_565	Oh . ; Well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_913	So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer ; and we can , can run these . ; So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . ; And , you know , start , working on it ,
Bmr019_1613	But ; Is it changed now , or ? ; I hadn't heard back from Mari after I I u u uh , brought up the point abou about Andreas 's schedule . ; So , um , maybe when I get back there 'll be some some mail from her .
Bmr030_233	So , instead of having um , utterances in the bottom , it 's like just word by word . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you can see exactly where the overlaps are . ; Oh .
Bro028_287	that 's the the flaw of the experiment . ; This is just i j it 's just one subject , ; Yeah . ; Getting close .
Bmr014_258	Their maintenance people . ; Well , we 'll see what it it 's like . ; Yep . ; That tha that can be quite good .
Bdb001_266	Exactly . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bns001_698	that uh the base station thing is different ; and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different ; but from the point of view of the mobile things uh I 'm not sure if if ; It 's packaged data oriented .
Bsr001_1841	it 's hard for them to give us money ; but they they seem to be willing to give us time . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus .
Bro018_240	That 's all ? ; It 's ; Yeah . ; That 's pretty bad .
Bmr018_925	yeah . ; I think it 's ; Well the problem is I you know I I it 's a it 's a really good question , ; and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things
Bmr015_663	and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . ; Yeah . ; Cuz there are large s spaces of the ; That 's a good point .
Bns001_161	Then everybody sees the structure , how it is uh , structured really structured . ; Yeah ; and ; Then maybe you wi can easy offer some additional input which should be presented , then , on the web pages .
Bns002_1201	OK . ; OK . ; But , in fact , there is an ongoing new version , I think it 's c version - A , ; but it is not uh commercially available
Buw001_2021	Yeah . ; Not not entirely modify it , ; but lessen it if if it 's desired . ; But if if that 's sufficient data
Bmr003_689	Yeah . ; But then you have to take the time to mark it . ; Yeah . ; And then there 's the issue of it 's easier to hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of somewhere in the middle ,
Bro012_1316	Mm - hmm . ; and roughly independent errors , ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's a good choice for
Bro012_1248	where w we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything . ; But we what we ; uh ; I guess we could
Bsr001_1629	That 's good . ; Oh , absolutely . ; Yeah . ; Great .
Bed011_610	Never . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No .
Bmr028_1291	Yeah . ; So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file , it will actually compare the words based on their time marks . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_451	so they want to be as similar as possible . ; A and , so I gue ; So . But I think the answer is , if if we tell him " no , that 's not alright " , what he 'll probably say is " well , we 're gonna do it anyway " . ; It could be interesting .
Bro008_458	Uh Uh I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know . ; We 're talking about thirty to sixty percent , uh , error rate reduction . ; That 's that 's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time . ; But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , uh , no one could really use it .
Bmr025_132	Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows . ; And so I think that 's the way we should go . ; I Can I ask a question ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_215	the Robustness meetings ; Switchboard ; and CallHome , ; and , found and sort of compared the numbers .
Bns002_1213	and the new ones are the the eleven megabits uh are uh two point four m uh ISM band . ; Megahertz , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_225	It 'd be interesting ; Yeah . ; So four four minutes all together with none none . ; Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ?
Bmr013_182	And we 've only recently got it to anywhere near human . ; It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , ; Pre - prehistory . ; yeah .
Bed006_1689	Yeah , sometimes things belong and ; So actually I 'm not sure ; I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . ; Like I know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that ,
Buw001_1013	Well , that 's the interesting thing , though . ; and wasn't ; If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . ; Oh .
Bed013_441	I 'm sorry I didn't mean to ; I 'm sorry . ; I 'm sorry , oh these are all the same . ; OK ! th this is not very on target .
Bmr019_472	but for the everybody , it 's little under a factor or two . ; Yeah . I I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone , ; at least from the good one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_321	Some objects are more picturesque , ; and you more f more highly photographed . ; Then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . ; Um . Sometimes I found in the Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint ,
Bmr014_141	Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is well , a couple things . ; First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . ; So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in , ; and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them .
Bro023_1340	Um , it helps a lot over the ba the baseline ; but , mmm ; By how much ? ; it
Bmr008_837	But I think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful ; instead of " Region now " , say . It 's a little bit unbounded . ; um so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there . ; well , you know , there 's this issue of of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns , whatever they are .
Bns001_1774	and if I stay longer of course we can go on ; but nevertheless I rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody , ; and it 's in their own interest ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bed013_295	Do it next week or ; I 'm gonna finish it today , uh hopefully . ; OK . ; I wanna do one of those things where I stay here .
Bmr023_171	OK . ; Uh ; But one issue actually that just came up in discussion with Liz and and Don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_337	Yeah . ; and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . ; I mean this is the kind of reason why ; I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , " can't be done " .
Bro004_1354	Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine . ; And if we can do things on Linux , some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um It seems pretty fast .
Bro005_723	even though I really like JRASTA ; and I really like MSG , ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it it may be complicated .
Btr001_456	Mm - hmm . ; So maybe I mean , depending on where she is , like maybe ; But she was also very low volume . ; ch
Bmr013_898	Right . ; Yeah . ; And uh , Jane had this nice , uh , idea of having , like an extra , uh couple tiers , ; An extra channel .
Bmr028_371	OK . ; I put that in just for you . ; Terrific . ; Well , since you didn't answer the emai
Bns003_356	Mm - hmm . ; so how maybe how you did it or whatsoever . ; OK , ; I will send you some because I have something in mind .
Bed004_823	And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom , ; i that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction that there 's uh something about the intent ; you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff , ; in independent of whether it about what is this or where is it or something , that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way .
Bro013_589	If you look at this um spectrum , ; Yeah . ; What 's this again ? ; Is it the mel - filters ?
Bmr024_610	This is to get acoustic and language model training data for SmartKom. OK . ; It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom system . ; The English system ? ; Yeah .
Bmr014_539	Maybe it was a technical ter ; exactly . ; But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you ; know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses
Bmr009_1136	like ; You know am I speaking with German accent ; Oh . ; I don't think so .
Bmr008_853	yeah ; I mean , I think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now , ; di ; the whether they picked it up at the one age or another .
Bed016_147	but . I already read half of it , ; Um , I don't I , uh I don't need it . ; so it 's OK . ; OK .
Bmr022_545	Right . ; and , um , have a student or a transcriber run this alignment , ; or we can do it ; Yep .
Bmr021_907	Yeah . ; So w ; different feature sets ? ; Yep .
Bed005_602	OK . ; Uh , take what they have , ; send it to everybody saying " this is what they have , ; this is what we think we should add " ,
Bmr014_1074	I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . ; You know . ; I ; Well , but they won't get that feedback .
Bns001_1433	but because you can have several mechanism ; really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description , ; you can have more of a qualitative description , ; you can have taken into account moving patterns ,
Bmr016_1863	Yeah that 's it . ; Um ; That 's it . ; Yeah , that 's that 's been changed .
Bed003_494	" Nice walls " is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , a Oh ; yeah . Sorry . It is binary .
Bed003_106	" Nice walls " which we can look up ; because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode , ; right , ; there 's gotta be a reason for it .
Bmr014_1102	OK . ; Uh , fair enough . ; Turn about is fair play , ; Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever
Bed011_325	Mm - hmm . ; Maybe I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects ; Mm - hmm . ; and then take a breather ,
Bmr028_837	Ye - It 's also an interesting problem to come up with the reference . ; Mm - hmm . ; And ; So , the reference file for the relative times at which
Bmr024_1385	Here we 're - we 're saying that we there gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . ; And it ; See cuz , i i there could be lots of things . ; Right ?
Bmr024_340	Yeah , I 'm I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . ; I mean I ; I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . ; And and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet .
Bmr029_612	Y y you said it would be easy for you to do that top one there , ; and I guess Don can do the segmentations of the , uh , channel F ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um
Bed004_606	Right . ; But , presumably that that that functionality 's there when when we ; So the immediate problem is just deciding w which ; Aspects of the X - schema to add .
Bro005_162	and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . ; Um . for the ne rest of experiment I use multi - English , ; only multi - English . ; And I try to combine different type of feature ,
Bro013_626	Yeah . ; What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT ; you could you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate estimate uh pitch . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_900	fe ; You 'd you wanna not . ; OK . ; So we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out
Bro010_879	so the ; OK , ; so at each for each sub - band there are basically , uh , several measures of SNR and and correlation . ; Ah ,
Buw001_1820	Yeah . ; Um , anyway ; I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up . ; My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it
Bro023_917	Uh , on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake ; because you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated .
Bro013_676	OK . ; And ; um ; so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work
Bro012_346	So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I increased the number of Gaussians . ; Right . ; Sorry . ; So um , how 's it going on the
Bmr003_2481	Well ; I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed009_903	Right . ; But it it it doesn't look like i you 're using it . ; I didn't n see it being used in the current template uh parser . ; I I didn't see any Uh
Bro004_132	So for Italian on the Italian speech @ @ . ; The second test is trained on a single language um with broad database , ; but the same language as the t task data . ; OK .
Bro012_665	That 's cool . ; And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , ; so . ; Oh great .
Bro019_1494	My my cardboard box is actually a nice spacious two bedroom apartment . ; So a two bedroom cardboard box . ; Th - that 's great . ; yeah
Bsr001_917	I mean Broadcast News is for this third - party listener , ; Hmm ? ; right ? ; Right .
Bro012_728	But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way . ; The reason I put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different . ; Uh . And so I thought " Oh , this is good . " ; but I I just
Bed012_116	Well i well , it 's an XML Structure that 's being res returned , ; Oh . Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; So every part of a structure is a " Struct " .
Bmr002_315	You 're going to listen to these things and ; I 'm going to provide I 'm going to be ; once I 'm given the data , I will provide w word - level transcripts with uh indication of speakers , ; OK .
Bmr010_350	You saw that ? ; OK . So you probably did get that . ; So Brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that , uh that our ; that they are making progress
Bmr028_1494	Hmm . ; And so that was important to know as a baseline . ; And and then , once you knew that , then s you go " well , now how do I know that that 's noisy ? " ; Hmm .
Bed014_70	Forge ahead , yeah . ; Cool . ; Are you in charge ? ; Sure .
Bns002_1277	you know eh Bluetooth eh is using a frequency hopping system ; and uh ; mmm ; both uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping , spread the spectrum techniques , are also intended to provide uh interference l uh less , uh data transmission .
Buw001_1325	Say I I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , ; I 'm more of an acoustics person " . ; Right . ; But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is what was that part that that that , uh , Mari was saying ? "
Bmr028_242	Yeah . ; And then still do it ahead of time , ; but then at least you 're covered if if , uh if there 's a problem . ; Yeah , if there are any problems .
Bed014_208	Try Oregon . ; Oh . ; Oregon Graduate Insti ; Ah .
Bmr002_862	Yeah . ; But you asked me about uh tools and things ; and um There 's this one ; Yeah .
Bmr018_928	and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things ; because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line ; and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down ; I mean , i it depends on how lar
Bmr028_1273	That 's true . ; You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that . ; Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem . ; It 's
Bmr008_290	So . ; and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_807	S ; Well , Dan Montello sort of , ; he he does the uh uh th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . ; And he he always talks about these
Bmr031_901	it 's more than a ; And so these right here have been through the double - check . ; These haven't . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_191	and this new system has eighty - nine . ; But I don't think it indicates something , really . ; I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_1464	but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff . ; OK . ; OK . ; OK , thanks .
Bed010_569	OK . ; Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . ; So . ; Right .
Bmr026_758	Mm - hmm . ; We are doing recognition in both of them . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_692	de audio data itself ? ; until people have a chance to edit it . ; Mm - hmm , exactly . ; Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there .
Bro003_1821	Well , creating the mappings , actually . ; and then creating i m changing labels on TIMIT ? ; Yeah . ; Or on or on multiple language multiple languages ?
Bdb001_925	I mean , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want , ; but if we use the ATLAS external file representation , um , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl , ; Yeah . ; and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure ,
Bro024_1347	But did you use channel did you align channel one also ? ; Or ; I just took their entire Italian training part . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1040	It 's more like " uh - huh ! " ; rather than " uh - huh " . ; I 'm ; Yeah .
Bed003_396	Yeah , ; Then ; that would be whatever building they referred to . ; Prosody .
Bed015_923	Right . ; Yeah , all all of those . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr009_298	Yeah . ; What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_540	Sure . ; But not if it costs more . ; Right . ; Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns
Btr001_2392	But it 's stuck in ; maybe it 's a little louder than usual . ; It 's not any of the extra , um , you know , glottal thing . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_34	have filled out speaker forms . ; Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . ; So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms ; and for meetings in which the " key " file and the transcript files are parsable .
Bmr018_1240	and so that should be should be ; if it 's right against your head there , which is what it 's supposed to be , that balances it ; Ah . ; so it doesn't slide up .
Bmr011_1135	but but that 's the one where we 're , um , trai training on , ; so that 's a little bit ; Oh . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr024_182	Yep . ; Right . ; So th ; Well , you know , actually , are we having them
Bmr015_687	I I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , after the the last experience . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; And and I 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , I I implement . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1231	Yep . ; Yeah , it 's timing difference . ; Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . ; It - it 's not amplitude ,
Bns001_549	yeah , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; that 's right .
Bmr014_515	and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . ; So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " . ; Hmm . ; And the other one didn't .
Bro021_114	So , well . ; It seems pretty ; Wasn't there some experiment you were gonna try ; where you did something differently for each , um , uh I don't know whether it was each mel band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or someth
Bro019_828	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean they just do the same thing again once more .
Bmr011_1799	The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , time things . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you
Bns001_1166	OK . ; My impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already . ; So , multicast . This means that there are many things done . ; Oh , what was it ?
Bmr025_1038	Initiate him . ; We we could . ; Should we do simultaneous ? ; Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ?
Bmr003_2053	this is the table cross section . ; I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at . ; You trying to screw up the m the microphones ? ; Yes .
Bro004_242	What would you say ? ; Around one point four ; yeah . ; OK .
Bed016_1182	It was a very early one . ; The very very first one . ; I don't know if it 's the first one . ; Mmm .
Bed015_2081	I don't know . ; We 're really running late , ; so I had , uh , an idea yesterday ; but , uh , I don't know whether we should even start discussing .
Btr001_1832	But then some people tend to ; There 's one guy in particular who does that . ; It 's really cute actually . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_998	Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error . ; And uh it was ; I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . ; We never did really fix up the dictionary .
Bmr020_1133	That would be more natural ; Well , ; but ; that 's that 's right ,
Buw001_397	Mm - hmm . ; and you want to ask questions to get more detail . ; th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . ; Well , it doesn't have to be .
Bed013_1347	with context and enough user information , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Absolutely fine .
Bro027_454	Two outputs . ; OK . ; So I guess about eleven thousand parameters , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_486	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , uh ; Um . ; So it 's
Bed002_632	Muh . ; So , I know . ; Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ? ; Yep .
Bmr008_1113	I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , source , destination , relation . ; Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ?
Bmr008_187	You can always get more specific . ; And , it may be ; I mean , so what would you suggest ? ; I don't know .
Bed002_167	to give ourselves something easier . ; And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , ; which is a common connected digits corpus . ; So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made .
Bns001_962	I mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing ; and uh I 'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation . ; I mean , are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology ? ; Or , are ju just they discarding this technology
Btr002_2712	You can see the little little peaks , which is interesting . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr011_979	Cuz you know , if you don't know ; Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . ; Just out of curiosity , I mean ; They also all have h heavy accents .
Bmr003_1290	He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . ; OK . ; The the It 's a good suggestion . ; So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now .
Bmr028_429	And you need a better user interface for displaying the results . ; But this helps a lot . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro004_620	That sixty - one point four ? ; Yeah . But it 's not a clean case . ; It 's a noisy case ; but uh training and test noises are the same .
Bmr009_1018	The problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to it you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent , ; but New York and Boston are two ; well , I guess they have the NYC , ; but New England has a bunch of very different dialects
Bed015_1183	And I think again , um , it 's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you " is this static or is this dynamic " . ; So we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . ; Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ? ; Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?
Bmr009_1307	That 's what I thought . ; it just said Region colon . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1781	But , eh , for me and for my problems , is uh is enough . ; Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , uh , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment ; what happened with the the different parameters . ; And only with a different bands of color for the , uh , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ .
Bro028_1095	As as we were talking about this I was thinking , um , whether there 's a relationship between um , between Michael 's approach to , uh , some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets . ; Yeah . ; So , like , if we have , ; Hmm .
Bed002_762	Mm - hmm . ; um , that that will help us along those lines . ; But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . ; So , to Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing .
Bmr019_718	we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together . ; Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . ; And we also ; There was some neat or , interesting cases ,
Bed005_540	First of all , I was little bit ; It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before . ; t ; It seems to me that some notions were missing .
Bdb001_651	And you could either say that ; No . ; I don't know ; I take that back .
Bmr011_483	but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . ; Hmm . ; And so , uh , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . ; But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , uh , one or more other people i uh , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be .
Bdb001_642	Right . ; You would have another tag somewhere . ; It 's well , there 're two ways of doing it . ; S so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without a time - mark .
Bro027_260	And it compiled fine . ; Eight . ; Oh , eh , great . ; No problems .
Bro027_1385	And then feed it to HMM . ; I mean , it 's you know , you 're just basically i ; Yeah , so this is like a two d two dimensional tile . ; You 're shifting the feature space .
Bro007_97	Um and how does this compare to the numbers ; oh so OGI two is just the top top row ? ; Yeah . ; So yeah to
Bed013_1072	Um , look at it this way , ; i ; Yeah . ; What did we decide .
Bmr024_331	Well , we we know what they read , because we have the forms . ; No , they make mistakes . ; Right . ; But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits .
Bmr031_324	uh uh uh uh , it 's not a it 's not a conference . ; It 's not a workshop , really . ; Right . ; It 's just connecting with them .
Bmr015_469	and and there there would be expansion , ; but , ; also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , ; grants that are ending ,
Bro026_715	and So the noise is There is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files . ; And there are noises that are different from the noises used on TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , I wouldn't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge .
Bro013_351	and so you accumulate the delay ; so the VAD should be before the LDA ; which means perhaps on the terminal side ; and then smaller and
Bmr016_1748	Tickle ? ; they meant " tickle " as in ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bmr027_1091	um , uh , ; instead of " from something - or - other cards " , it 's " for multicast " . ; And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " . ; This was changed to an acronym initially
Bed015_1152	Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . ; Um . ; S so again ; Then " predications " makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not .
Bsr001_1747	Yeah , ; Really ? ; that 's pretty ; Mmm .
Bro018_892	Let 's go back to what you thought I was asking you . ; Yeah ; no and I didn't have a chance to do that . ; Ha !
Bmr019_136	So , also , Andreas , on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head . ; And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much . ; It is against my head . ; OK .
Bmr008_809	Right . ; I mean , even like Cal - LA is totally different than ; And then ; I mean , you really can't um
Bmr005_230	And we did mention who " he " was . ; Yeah . ; Early in the conversation . ; Yeah .
Bro012_725	Yeah . ; So there are clearly are spectral effects . ; Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies . ; But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way .
Bdb001_601	yeah , channel is what the channelized output out ; It doesn't ; This isn't quite right . ; I have to look at it again .
Bro024_933	or ; No their filter is not M domain . ; Yeah . ; S so they did filter their time signal
Bro005_189	I ; Um , the uh , baseline system ; when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? ; That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing ,
Buw001_29	We know exactly how much you have left in your cup . ; So are we recording now ? ; Is this ; Yeah .
Bns001_1099	But ; Yes . ; that shouldn't be your only way of ; There 's a gate You can put the gateway
Bmr024_479	It 'll give you a lot more data , too . ; Won't it ? ; Yeah . ; So , it 's basically
Bed002_977	Yeah , it 's @ @ . ; Go back . ; To v ; OK .
Bro017_1322	The way that it works is each person goes around in turn , and uh you say the transcript number and then you read the digits , the the strings of numbers as individual digits . ; No . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you don't say " eight hundred and fifty " , you say " eight five oh " , and so forth .
Bed011_1096	Mm - hmm . ; So , you know , as as the SmartKom people have . ; This is sort of their standard demo dialogue , which is , you know , what the system survives and nothing but that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_594	Yes . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So that that uh
Bro007_90	Uh not yet . ; No . ; OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good ; Mmm yeah , yeah .
Bro022_491	um , ; there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct . ; So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , ; and I subtracted that phase off
Buw001_1332	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around ; and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff .
Bns001_177	Or , is it planned or not , ; Yeah su You can have ; or ? ; Yeah , you can have it .
Bdb001_166	How would you ? ; I would use just an existing an existing way of doing it . ; Why ; Mmm .
Bmr026_647	Alright . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; I think I have a pretty good idea
Bro004_1202	So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same ; so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way ; and then it 'd be OK . ; Ah .
Bed006_1328	which will probably be f richer and fuller and have other stuff in there . ; Yeah . ; This sounds like a paper I 've read around here recently in terms of ; Yeah it could be not a coincidence .
Bed013_716	here is understanding if you wanna do it right , ; and you know without going into technical ; Mm - hmm . ; But then in the end we 're not doing like those things right yet , right ?
Bed003_1410	OK . ; This person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business . ; Um , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . ; Um , I don't know .
Bmr015_75	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; a short meeting would be fine . ; This does sound like we 're doing fine , ; yeah .
Bed016_1069	Yeah , I was gonna say , like ; Uh ; Oh , you can do that ? ; Really ?
Bed003_286	Yeah . ; Stab at it . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr026_1250	Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed003_1423	It 's in the these these these plan schemas . ; I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate , ; you know . ; " What do you need need to buy a ticket ? "
Bmr027_685	OK . ; That for every meeting ; any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of . ; Oh .
Bmr002_683	Right . ; So they probably will have tools to address the actual the the the transcriber support ; Oops . ; and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you ,
Btr002_47	Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time ; and maybe , uh , go over some some ideas about , um , ; well , i the return to the conventions , ; but I also wanted to , uh , share with you a couple of the things that I 've picked up in terms of checking .
Bmr014_990	Yeah . ; but but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . ; And and I ha ; I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage .
Bro017_180	Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically , ; which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise , ; and so far not much uh success . ; Hmm .
Bmr029_543	and cross correlate them , ; That 's right . ; so there 's no point in not using that knowledge for speaker identification . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1480	Great . OK . ; and uh ; But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1103	Right . ; So th so the sorts of questions I had were one Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting , ; I mean , will we re will we require it . ; I would tend to leave that e spontaneous ,
Bro010_566	you estimate what they are , ; and , uh , ; so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . ; And then you look over the whole thing
Bro012_704	I noticed that in the pictures . ; yeah . ; I thought " hey , you know th " I ; My initial thought was " this is not too bad ! "
Bed012_471	No , there 's No . ; But ; It 's through the ; So th s so , yeah , but some So , some things would drop out , and some things would still be important .
Bmr020_1902	So ; What time is it ? ; Uh , why don't we do it together , ; Uh , quarter to four .
Bmr024_189	Because , uh , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it . ; We we didn't cut those out . ; Yeah . ; They are not transcribed yet .
Bed009_1067	So th the and this is an again attempt to get very wide coverage . ; So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2768	Hmm . ; So yeah , you 've s they slip through . ; Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice . ; but I 've seen a several " breath " 's too .
Bro017_611	in the proposal . ; in ; uh - huh , uh - huh . ; So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w
Bns002_1578	And , maybe you take a look to the uh last two slides , ; um Um , ; maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available . ; So you have , in principle , here now the mapping of the different areas , um within GPS ,
Bed005_302	Uh , I 'll tell you why . ; Because it gives a you a score . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bmr027_57	But . ; Um . So , w what follows ? ; At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? ; No .
Bns001_1655	and you have a GPS , ; and they know , OK , it 's based on satellite . ; And there 's UMTS , that is based on base station . ; There 's all that they consider .
Bed003_151	I don't remember w ; Uh - huh . ; It was a long time ago . ; There 's a lot of those .
Bmr009_671	Mm - hmm . ; And hopefully it 's more like on the order of ; I 'm not sure that 's necessarily true . ; Yeah ?
Bmr030_183	but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all . ; I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight . ; Hmm . ; I think he had one twenty - eight ,
Bro022_746	first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , ; Yeah . ; and then take the likely candidates and go further . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_762	There were a few people you , and like , three or four people who really like them . ; The uh ; The Crown . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr027_534	and they wouldn't actually hear from us , ; and then they find this thing is in there ; and we 've already distributed it to someone . ; So , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,
Bro027_86	Yeah , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it 's it 's a weight on the ball spectrum .
Btr002_2089	No , I don't ; Yeah . ; Really ? ; Occasionally .
Bmr007_832	Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ? ; No . ; I certainly could though . ; But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do .
Bmr009_46	but um uh Jose and I were just talking about the uh uh , speech e energy thing , ; The @ @ ; Yeah . ; and I uh
Bro018_744	Um ; or to come up with these vectors to see how closely they match the phones , ; Oh . ; Right ,
Bmr003_1553	So th ; So . ; And that 's w that 's where I added comments . ; Hmm .
Btr001_771	So ; I don't know . ; That 's kind of interesting . ; Usually it 's not
Bed003_1633	I think it 's Ben actually , ; Ben , then , ; Ben . ; yeah ,
Bro014_85	And so , ; um , I I ran a couple of experiments where I reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , I think , ; and I got almost the exact same results . ; And but it runs much much faster .
Bmr025_236	How does it play ? ; What I ; But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . ; Yeah , right .
Bmr019_37	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean
Bro026_159	And it uses , uh , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , ; the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . ; And after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins . ; Mmm .
Bro005_1290	But they 're working really hard , too . ; So by the time you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score ; Mmm . ; and now there isn't any difference ,
Bsr001_168	That 's a nice user interface , Dan . ; That 's that 's really something . ; Very ; what does " solo " mean ?
Bro023_427	So , what was the , um , uh , corresponding number , say , for , um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ? ; Mmm . ; Do you know ? ; Yeah ,
Bed015_1683	Mm - hmm . ; And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . ; And so , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_158	Yeah . ; So " all the slides " it 's w started too late . ; Right . ; It 's another case of devoicing at the initial
Bro004_1092	ASP . ; This is ; Oh . ; Anybody know any
Bed012_429	So , someone asked a question . ; Yeah . ; How do we decide how to answer it ? ; Well , look at look Face yourself with this pr question .
Bed008_1320	X - two voted for V ; Mm - hmm . ; and so forth ? ; Y right .
Bro026_133	You 're talking about the meeting with Hynek ? ; So . ; Yeah . ; Cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of
Bro007_362	I mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; that 's that 's that 's not proper
Bro012_1173	you know , uh even with the voiced - non voiced - unvoiced ; Mmm . ; um ; I thought that you or somebody was talking about
Bmr016_1336	and then everyth i well , actually later today probably . ; Hmm . ; And so then we 'll have everything following these conventions . ; But you notice it 's really rather a small set of these kinds of things .
Bro010_631	Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , ; you know ? ; yeah , ; because
Bmr014_946	But we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all . ; Well , we do because of privacy . ; We can't just make it openly available on the web . ; No , no .
Bro018_504	It 's probably a good place to start . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah and a short short amount of time ,
Bmr031_742	See , and that 's probably what we should send around for these to d for distribution of this corpus . ; This s s isn't any ; A whole handful of microdrives . ; Yeah .
Bro019_168	You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job ; Uh - huh . ; A thousand times ? ; right ?
Bed013_244	As far as ; That 's @ @ That 's big . ; Actually ; Oh ! We calculated a different number before .
Bro004_1158	Huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . ; Yeah .
Bro013_206	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's ; You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here . ; Yeah .
Bed016_160	That was the most recent one ? ; Uh , yeah , I think so . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bed013_623	I got an email . ; OK . ; By the way , Keith is comfortable with us calling him " cool Keith " . ; Oh . Cool . Keith .
Btr001_1839	Yeah . ; cuz they 're always , " Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm " Um , reacting . Yeah . ; Reacting . ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_16	and um I I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands . ; OK . ; It has a mind . ; Got it .
Bmr013_969	Yeah ? K . ; the microphones the new microphones , ; when do we get , uh ? ; Uh , they said it would take about a week .
Bro007_466	OK . ; Mmm . ; Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1290	OK . ; Now do we know , either from their experience or from yours , that , uh , just having , uh , two parameters , the the mean and variance , is enough ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , I know you don't have a lot of data to estimate with ,
Bmr010_986	You know , I can I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . ; But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions ; and , you know , the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back ; so these th sort of calibration issues .
Bmr027_42	I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . ; But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2360	" tisk " . ; and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . " ; Like a shrug or a vocal some some sort of like , " Well , there it is " . ; Yes .
Bro024_1727	uh , so not not right now maybe . ; Well , maybe . ; Maybe . ; The VAD later will be much better .
Bed013_651	OK . ; Yeah , that is something for the rest of the gang to to g ; The thing with the goats and the helicopters ? ; Change the watchband .
Bro021_1373	So . ; Uh , OK . ; S so , we switch off with this ; Whenever you 're ready .
Bsr001_1952	It is a unification base , ; it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular , ; although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds . ; I see .
Bro008_116	And , um they they differed in some respects , ; but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , uh , which is the biggest difference , I think . ; But but there 're there 're there 're some other differences , too . ; Uh , and and , uh , they both did very well ,
Bro014_749	Isn't it ; is ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_125	OK . ; Yeah . ; And ; I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good .
Bro012_480	Oh , no , I 've ninety - four . ; Oh , the baseline , you mean . ; Yeah . ; Well I don't I 'm not talking about the baseline here .
Bmr030_511	I mean the o the other problem is you would wanna r do it on an unloaded machine . ; Right ? ; Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering . ; Yep .
Bns003_1022	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I 'm do not remember whether w whether you were ; That must be three weeks ago ,
Bmr023_645	Right . ; Right . Would they give you the same number of words , though ? ; It 's either early or late . ; Right .
Bmr030_38	It 's it 's um , it 's some money that we can use ; It 's government - run , I guess . ; Uh , I mean , we 're in conjunction with uh , SRI , Washington , and , um , Columbia . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_214	uh ; M ; Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah , ; Ah .
Buw001_1151	So so that was the prosody thing . ; We - I don't remember it . ; Um , we need to finish the ; Oh , OK .
Bed003_1370	and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , ; what happens is you know the parser parses it ; and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . ; It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented .
Bro013_666	Mm - hmm . ; um ; thinking of maybe using um um m modulation spectrum stuff to um as features um also in the in the sub - bands ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1504	Oh , is that what you 're talking about ? ; Oh . ; If you use that ; Mmm .
Bmr003_470	I mean , I s I I saw that write - up . ; Yeah . ; Maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did ; Yeah ,
Btr001_2159	Do you people ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , does everyone agree with that intu ; I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn .
Bmr006_630	Yep . ; No , no , ; well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is . ; I think it 's DI .
Bmr010_1346	Mm - hmm . ; dividing , eh , speech , eh , of from a speaker and overlapping , ; to try to to do , eh , eh , a fast a fast , eh , experiment to to prove that , nnn , this fea eh , general feature , eh , can solve the the the problem , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_271	So , is it , uh , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which which are all like where where your tongue comes to rest . ; Uvular .
Bro021_1354	It 's another type of approximation because i because it 's a statistic statistic approximation to remove the noise . ; I don't know . ; Right . ; Great .
Bro027_407	Oh , OK . ; So . ; Wow . ; Uh , so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets ,
Bmr012_860	OK . ; Right . ; it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long ; Mmm .
Bro003_1164	Running on what ? ; Uh , M MFCC . ; No , ; I 'm sorry ,
Bed004_111	And now comes the ; This is the phone - in phase of ; Wait , can I I have a question . ; So . So there 's no system ,
Bmr013_802	Absolutely . ; yeah . ; I did I did , um , uh , so , last night I did , uh , ; Oh gosh ,
Bed002_735	Uh , ; N no , no not ; i it was mobile ; but not not with a w a real wizard system .
Bed008_1189	you click on " endpoint " , ; OK ; Mm - hmm . ; and everything else fades
Bro026_47	But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , Pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; And , uh and and I guess actually , uh , after Eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too .
Bmr026_900	Mm - hmm . ; and and uh , um , and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT . ; Hmm . ; Uh But uh which So that 's what they 're they 're using now .
Bro003_278	So w f for for uh Italian , which is close to Spanish , French and , i i uh , TI - digits we have both uh , digits training data and also more general training data . ; So . Mmm . ; Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for English . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1194	And I ; does anybody remember the GUI on this ? ; Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know N - many belief - nets ; and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one
Bro010_898	And , uh ; so ; so that 's just that 's just one detector . ; So you can imagine building many of these detectors on different features .
Bro019_458	So . ; So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , ; because you don't have the mistakes in it . ; Yeah .
Bns003_164	He did a lot of work ; Right . ; and I could only pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages . ; Ah , the messages .
Bro018_1160	yeah , ; it 's a lot more training data . ; So ; So probably it should be something we should try then is to is to see if is at some point just to take i to transform the data
Bmr010_1503	and , ; um , ; as with a lot of things , it is not uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds . ; And then there 's , you know Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it is it is it , uh , delta of those things ?
Bmr003_2261	Wow . ; But , you always ; Uh , ; well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the the , uh , powering system .
Bmr016_66	So the there are no errors in the digits , ; you 'll always read the string correctly . ; So I can't imagine why anyone would care . ; So the other topic with digits is uh ,
Bmr026_156	I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . ; He 's sort of been been volunteering for everything ; and and uh ; Yeah .
Bro012_1215	And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So um that 's something that is sort of finer ,
Bmr011_112	So And I also talked to Mari this morning ; and she also had a strong preference for doing that . ; And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1431	Yeah , the though I think uh there was one problem with that in that , you know , we used canonical mapping ; so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics . ; Uh - huh . ; Hmm .
Bro012_90	so . ; Yeah . ; um uh But . ; So it was it was a bad example in that way ,
Bmr012_946	well well it 's sort of related ; but um ; good news also ; uh I got
Bro003_1706	but to to do something on this project . ; So the question is , " Where where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? " ; Um , ; yeah ,
Bmr028_648	Oh , yeah . There 's that pressure . ; Uh , Abbott disk ? ; Uh . I know they 're in . ; OK .
Bro018_1175	OK . ; So the question is how close to that one can you get if you transform the data using that system . ; r Right , so so I guess this SRI system is trained on a lot of s Broadcast News or Switchboard data . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_171	We hafta cut the , uh ; Right . ; So . ; W s so is Morgan , is the plan to just pick one of the far - field mikes ?
Bmr019_1695	And and ; but , I mean , this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too . ; I don't I have no idea . ; I think this is something that would need to be checked .
Bmr028_427	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And you need a better user interface for displaying the results . ; But this helps a lot .
Bro013_778	That 's right . ; It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things . ; Oh . OK . ; That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups .
Bmr010_1078	Yeah . ; And , uh , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr002_612	Yeah . ; I think you got it as a prize or something . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bro016_161	So , if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range , and taking the appropriate root . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know ?
Bro023_564	so what happened here is that , um , the overall improvement that they have with this method ; So Well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments ; and then they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence ; but they keep , uh , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech .
Bmr025_34	So can you just ; Oh , it is . ; OK . ; Uh - huh . No change .
Bro011_670	I mean , I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um ; where did six come from ? ; Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_650	And the other th ; given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever , ; rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , ; and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .
Bed015_1745	I mean , those those tend to be , um , funky anyways ; because they blur ; So we don't have that in here either do we ? ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1208	Yep , yep . ; Good point . ; I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress ; Yep .
Bed006_720	and right now the way the interface is " action go " and then they have the what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type " going into " , goes of type " want to go to a place where I can take a picture of " , et cetera . ; So this is sort of what it looks like
Bdb001_57	So ; I it 's it 's a question both of what the representation is and ; You mean , this ; I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board .
Bmr016_1414	Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Ah ! ; Uh ,
Bmr002_254	Just as long as it 's with you know , uh within the constraints . ; What - what 's your mike number , Jane ? ; Number four . ; Oh , Sorry .
Bmr007_368	Let let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across . ; And and there well may be , but ; What what I what I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too i too imprecise . ; But what I mean is that , um in Switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap .
Bmr010_569	Oh . ; and I imagine they still plan to ; but but , you know , I haven't spoken with them about that recently . ; OK .
Bmr025_164	The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK ; Yeah . ; um you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits ; and you can type on them and listen to them .
Bed008_1456	Which is slightly tricky . ; Right . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1192	So , Don sort of , um , propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber ; Right . ; so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , um , you know , comma and things like that , ; and we kept the and disfluency dashes uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps
Bmr025_268	Oh , OK . ; So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats , ; Yeah . ; so that 's all going pretty well ,
Btr002_3061	It 's not i it 's ; Oh no , I 'm so sorry . ; Yeah . ; It 's not like you said the F - word .
Bed008_327	We can just rename that , yeah . ; Alright . ; You know , but that was actually , ; yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio
Bmr005_311	Yeah . ; Good ; Yeah . ; It 's an inference .
Bro013_201	Mmm . ; So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it for the English - Near you get something like two percent . ; And here you had , you know , something like three point four . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1120	We , uh I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . ; And polysemy , and stuff like that . ; Yeah . ; Hardly anything .
Bro028_671	So it could be I mean , Chuck and I had actually talked about this a couple times , and and over some lunches , I think , that , um , one thing that we might wanna do ; The - there 's this question about , you know , what do you wanna scale ? ; Suppose y you can't adjust these word insertion penalties and so forth , ; so you have to do everything at the level of the features .
Bed006_1258	and you could write it . ; Schemas uh that of that type . ; And then later , you know , there the we have a communication event action where we 'd define it down there as ; Hmm .
Bed003_522	Yeah , yeah . ; but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you ; Yeah . ; Like it 's a conjunction of ,
Bro005_1195	So they did At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . ; So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? ; I mean they they were not not using the neural net . ; Uh I don't know .
Bed005_1278	or ; but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology . ; It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector . ; OK .
Btr002_2681	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bed014_663	Yeah , I mean , if if you ask " how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost ? " and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say " OK How much is , uh I would like to visit the " whatever , something completely different , " then I go to , you know , Point Reyes " , ; Yeah . ; it it 's not more likely that you want to enter anything , ; but it 's , as a matter of fact , a complete rejection of entering by doing that .
Bro023_1063	Uh , so , it 's , uh , three point , uh , eight . ; Uh - huh . ; Am I right ? ; Oh , OK .
Bmr024_1355	Yeah , the likelihoods were lower for the PLP . ; as I recall . ; Oh . ; And so , uh , there 's the question
Bmr018_649	Yeah . ; And the grammar wasn't tuned either . ; It was just a @ @ . ; And it didn't matter whether it was the lapel or whether it was the
Bro005_1217	and using less CPU was better . ; Something like that , ; right ? ; Yeah , but
Bmr010_1373	Mmm , yeah . ; Yeah , but I 'm not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the s detector I I I used up to now , ; Uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1581	Yeah . ; Anyway , it 's colloquial , ; Anyway . ; an and and , uh , it 's it 's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sounds the way it sounds to you .
Bed016_273	I heard it . ; They might not hear it in the ; well maybe they will . ; I don't know .
Bmr020_885	So so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks . ; Whereas Thilo 's won't have that . ; Oh ! ; OK .
Bns001_142	So , I will send an email , then , to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they 're aligned with , um , their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages . ; And any feedback is then , well appreciated . ; No ? ; OK .
Bro024_610	This is next next page . ; That 's the next next spreadsheet , is ; Hmm . ; So that is the performance for Italian , Finnish and Spanish .
Bmr006_370	I I I I I agree . ; Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so ; Uh but I I think that the uh i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . ; Yep .
Bed010_715	Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts . ; But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go .
Bsr001_1223	Oh , well . ; The boxes are cheap . ; Right . ; Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless
Bmr013_491	Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . ; But ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1217	Well , it 's ; Yeah . ; and and and in his case , I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_30	It 's just uh ; Umh . ; Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information . ; And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that ,
Bro010_394	And if the neural net is better than this ; Hmm . ; or , well . ; Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything .
Btr001_421	Sure . ; Right . ; it 's really hard to understand . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_104	but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . ; Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . ; I 'd like to have lots of different people . ; Right .
Bns001_666	But this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; And you have the gateway to the PDN , or the Public Data Network . ; And between both there 's a certain kind of tunnel set up .
Bed014_1226	Sure . ; Yeah . Right . ; OK . ; That - that 's not that 's not saying it 's bad ,
Bed008_88	and so forth . ; yeah . ; So I 'll let ; we 'll see .
Bmr016_858	because disks don't crash very frequently , ; Right . ; as long as you can regenerate it . ; Right .
Bmr007_55	So . ; Um , So , uh so , I 'll go through that . ; Um , And , Anything else ? anyone wants to talk about ? ; No .
Bed016_928	There 's all sorts of stuff going on . ; So ; might be beyond what you want to do . ; let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal .
Btr001_1250	Yep . ; Oh , OK , ; yeah , then I 'm doing that right now . ; Right .
Bed016_1100	So y you don't wanna use one that 's ; Yeah , well ; No , but this ; that 's what I have , you know , started doing .
Bro018_81	Mmm . ; See , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um " does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . R
Bmr023_677	And it depends on speaking rate ; Yeah . Yeah . ; speaking rate . Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first .
Bmr007_972	Then it gets really hard no matter what you do . ; So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well I I have these other data over here , that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . " ; Yeah . ; Uh Suppose you don't use any of those things .
Bro025_388	Um . ; But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better ; and and , um , if , uh , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's you know , a secondary issue . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_259	But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . ; Now before we do that , let 's get back in ; Oh ! ; But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .
Bed009_979	We 're just gonna foreshadow what we saw that ; Right . ; and um ; Now actually ,
Bmr009_775	Are we supposed to keep recording here ? ; Yeah . Let 's do that later . ; Yeah . ; Yeah Right .
Buw001_1307	you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . ; We 'll I mean , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , ; so try to pick things that other people didn't say . ; It 's gonna take some thought .
Bed003_455	do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? ; Yeah , it does . ; OK . ; So then you just have some probabilities over
Bmr011_1762	and we throw it out . ; Mm - hmm . ; But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , ; so you get some speech and then a " mm - hmm " , and some more speech ,
Bmr008_989	OK . ; Yeah , I like that . ; I like that . ; That 's that 's non - threatening , and it 's also an i a good indicator .
Bro005_555	of equal equal weight . ; Maybe it shouldn't be equal weight . ; Maybe . ; Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that ,
Bed003_1746	I like that . ; " Test the wizard . " ; I want that on a T - shirt . ; Um I think it 's it 's it 's I mean
Bro004_1164	Mm - hmm . ; I think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like uh ; well , it 's not isolated word , ; but but connected ,
Bns002_929	Yeah , but anyway , that was the reason for my question . ; If I save with a lot of difficult mechanism , within the air interface and between the base station or access point and the mobile node , one percent of the power whereas ninety - nine percent is consumed by packet processing ; and and and and uh uh C P U or whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1042	Because because i we used X Waves to do the digits . ; Yeah . ; And they were loading the full mixed files then , ; Very quickly .
Bsr001_1561	Delete that part . ; None of that . ; N no eating during meetings . ; Right , right , right .
Bdb001_115	You know ? ; And then , uh , you could either say " time equals a particular time - mark " or you could do other sorts of references . ; So or or you might have a prosody ; " Prosody "
Bro028_436	rather than with with a s periodic source . ; Right ? ; So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise , ; where it 's voiced you use , uh , periodic pulses .
Bmr026_821	So . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system ; and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems ; and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_680	Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But we one of the interesting things was
Bmr007_910	Eh there there exists eh silence between between , eh a speaker . ; is is , eh eh acoustic , eh event , important to to consider . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_92	an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination . ; So ; uh in a sense , what we have in this kind of networks , is that , uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes . ; And this makes a uh difference from other kind of network .
Bro012_570	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; So I think it 's it 's OK .
Bed005_915	Right . ; And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that . ; That , these guys did in a in a day . ; Right .
Bmr025_726	So i if you take notes it 's a great little device . ; Could Mm - hmm . ; But I don't take notes , ; And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things ,
Bro025_69	OK . So a week ago ; maybe you weren't around when when when Hynek and Guenther and I ? ; Hynek was here . ; Yeah . I didn't .
Bed006_1458	and completely redo it , ; Well ; you know and and and it after some iterations we may just do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1619	And everyone is still using it , ; so . ; Yeah . ; But anyway , I I I think it 's it 's just the the i it 's it 's it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd came up with
Bro024_838	And that we , so , introduce again some natural behavior in this trajectory . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Very different from speech .
Bmr008_497	Well , we When we when we discussed it it was it was where where you lived during your childhood and adolescence . ; Um , I don't think we can do that because it would be different for ; Does that mean region of ; Region of the US , or region of the world
Bmr028_1018	I mean that that would be true if w you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes . ; But if you only had your PDA sitting in front of you ; Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much . ; And you have more than one mike .
Bro018_450	And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek , Mike Jordan , ; and I asked John Ohala and he agreed . ; Cool . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed004_730	turn a crank in the belief - net , ; that 'll come out with s uh more another vector , ; OK , ; which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end .
Bro005_788	yeah . ; Yeah . ; And ; Uh . And the other the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is
Bns001_1579	N Not only this . ; We can even use this u platform to to get some European projects in the future ; because you know , sometimes eh it 's a good thing ; yeah
Bmr012_210	but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that ; and then suddenly it turned very bad ; and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the ; Yeah , that might be that might be that might be my fault .
Bmr003_2549	So ; So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? ; Uh , y yeah . ; We we need to figure out what we want .
Bmr003_1720	So sometimes a pers I uh ; in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions , it 's i it isn't just words coming out , ; it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance . ; And sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it
Bro021_1210	In in the one you pointed at . ; v ; What 's that variable ? ; Uh , this is the
Bro011_427	And so ; I don't know how complicated it is to go from there ; What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . ; And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it
Bmr026_396	Yeah , I had . ; Well it 's about I think there 's about twelve gig left . ; So it And you have an X drives installed ? ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1603	but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , uh , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize , ; Right . ; so . ; Right .
Btr002_2679	Like sometimes " Hhh ! " is a laugh . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro028_819	N ; and then , uh ; So this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , I guess . ; Right ?
Bmr015_374	Yeah . ; But they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed011_826	right ? ; So you can s you can be really make it as cheap as possible , or you can say " I want , er , you know , I don't care " ; Money is no object . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_622	Yeah . ; Th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that . ; OK . ; And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that
Bmr002_629	OK . ; I didn't think to bring it . ; Ha - Have you looked at it already ? ; Oh , I have ,
Bed005_152	So this sentence sentence is parses the p the same output , ; Interesting parser property . ; um , even if you leave out , um , all all of this . ; I see .
Bro021_278	So what was the what was the threshold part of it ? ; Was the threshold , uh , how far down ? ; Yeah . ; Well , he yeah , he had to figure out how much to add .
Bro027_416	um ; Hmm . ; So . ; Hmm .
Bns001_1810	and ; We did not forget . ; We are done . ; Yeah , just leave them on for now .
Bmr024_386	I mean it ; sure , there there might be a place where it 's " beep seven beep eight beep eight beep " . ; But , you know , they they 're they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks . ; And so , I I don't think it 'll be a problem .
Bro008_523	Um ; Uh , so , yeah . ; I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_984	I think it 's better . ; How ; yeah ? ; How long have you been in an English speaking country .
Bro023_1318	yeah . ; Five zero . ; Um , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_204	One thought might be to do this uh , on on the digits , or some piece of the digits . ; Uh , it 'd be easier , uh , and so forth . ; The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i ; The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , um , just doing the simple mapping , from , um , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , uh , isn't right .
Bmr016_408	Yeah . ; Well , what I mean is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , ; but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people ; and the beam - forming stuf
Bro022_718	Yeah . ; It 's ; Mmm . ; Well , I mean ,
Bmr011_1404	disfluency tagging , ; um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . ; And Mari 's also interested in it , ; Andreas as well .
Bmr010_968	and ? ; OK . ; Um , um , the I I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us . ; They are , um , um , uh really perceptive and very , um
Btr002_2860	see now I 'm contradicting myself , ; but even when it is very turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people , ; um , ; and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions ,
Bmr008_1246	Will Will somebody go back and fill that in , or we just won't have it , or ; Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway . ; So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it . ; Mmm .
Bed006_1039	Interesting . ; Would you say that the like ; I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , ; but there 's also this sort of like causal ,
Btr001_2124	OK . ; Oh , yeah . ; It 's OK . ; That 'd be great .
Bed012_573	So basically , you 'd have a decision tree query , Go - there . ; If k if that 's false , query this one . If that 's true , query that one . ; And just basically do a binary search through the ? ; I don't know if it would necessarily be that , uh , complicated .
Bro019_1135	yeah . ; the coe the cepstrum coefficient , ; Uh - huh . ; that , like , the auto - correlation , the R - zero and R - one over R - zero
Bed010_889	So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete . ; Oh , OK . ; You don't have a hidden purist streak ? ; Oh no .
Bmr022_1342	Mm - hmm . ; And I I think that it 's , um , ; I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made . ; And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate .
Bro021_584	OK . ; The full ? ; Uh , i so if you trained on half as much and made the net , uh , uh , half as big , then it would be one fourth the amount of time ; OK .
Bro010_701	Yeah . ; We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , ; and built the averages from them . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_207	I mean , the talk 's only twenty minutes . ; It 's just gonna be a couple of ; So . You know , all this time we spent on it 's gonna be thirty seconds of screen time . ; I know .
Bmr016_426	I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious , ; but I really , I mean , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea , ; See , y ; You do the last line , I 'll do the first line .
Bro017_162	Mm - hmm . ; Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution . ; They have solution . ; Now they want to make sure their criterion is
Bed016_466	And everybody gets a trampoline in their office . ; Well , the the offices are actually a little ; the , ; think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix
Bmr005_144	But . ; Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap , ; because i in narratives , you know I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_550	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra . ; The speech . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1394	Right . ; Exactly . ; I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff ; Hmm .
Bns003_521	If there are no events , then there are no events . ; Yeah , yeah . ; But we still have a few which happened in the last year ; and OK ,
Bro004_560	On on um ; So . Um , ; oh I well , wait a minute . ; You have this here , for the Italian .
Bns001_813	Right ? ; It 's no more related to a network . ; I it 's ; We are leaving the network area .
Bmr007_191	and you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , ; so it 's now , universally a ag agreed with . ; And and , als ; I mean , I can't say universally ,
Bro023_1631	Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; I , um , also implemented a sp um spectral whitening idea
Bro015_106	So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit ? ; And and and trying to collate results ? ; and get something from it ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_449	Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , uh uh , learning articulatory feature in I think , in the case of his paper with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , EM . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and Um , ; so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh this is a neat data set .
Bmr011_70	Wha ; But if anyone has ; uh , the main thing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge about ways to , uh , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , ; that would be helpful to know about .
Bed016_961	Uh . So ; Yeah , I think that 's a good example , actually . ; S ; Yeah , that 's good .
Bmr031_746	Well , when they come out with an ; Is is the areal density of the microdrive higher than of a w normal drive ? ; It must be . ; When they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we 'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data .
Bro010_8	Uh , ; that was programmed for yesterday I guess . ; Uh ; Yesterday
Bed013_1027	Yeah . ; I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way , ; and probably not practical . ; Yeah , e ultimately that 's also what we wanna get at .
Bro024_1542	It 's just a constant noise addition . ; Um . ; And I I think w w ; I I 'm sorry .
Bmr006_1223	But it 's another source of information . ; I I Yeah . ; I don't I don't know ho ; I I I think
Bmr011_1850	Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global . ; It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , ; uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word . ; And it tends to do that .
Bmr007_376	and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which I think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1249	Hmm . ; they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh including ICSI software uh not for training on the nets ; Hmm . ; Oh .
Bed003_916	That 's acceptable . ; And I want to edit the function going to that , ; right ? ; No .
Bro003_1423	right ? ; To get these get these things sorted out . ; Yeah . ; So it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out .
Buw001_357	I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is , ; Maybe . ; and ; not what the query is .
Bro007_469	Mm - hmm . ; Yes . ; I guess they have to send it out ; let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh Wednesday
Bro010_20	No , nobody 's told me anything . ; Alright . ; Oh , this was the , uh , talk where they were supposed to try to decide ; To to decide what to do ,
Bro024_81	But , um ; yeah , I wou I would be curious about people 's feedback on this ; cuz I 'm @ @ I p I think there are some I think it 's it 's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem . ; I 'm trying to figure out what 's the optimal way to set this up .
Bro021_1051	Yeah , right . ; and then ; Yeah . ; Capital Y .
Bmr011_543	I mean , we don't care . ; That would be fine , ; So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? ; Buy more disk space .
Bro018_1187	there 's some digits training in there . ; OK . ; O one thing I 'm wondering about is what this mean subtraction method um will do if it 's faced with additive noise . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_899	It 's ; Yeah . ; And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time . ; Right .
Bro026_650	I mean , I think that it it is Uh . ; b ; This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_1661	Uh ; So we 'll do that t maybe uh ; But . ; OK .
Btr002_1677	Oh , I 'm glad . ; and just making fun of u ; Yeah . ; And so it 's really funny ,
Bro003_1607	You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah ,
Bro028_145	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and the silence probabilities also . ; Right .
Bmr022_1344	I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made . ; And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate . ; But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions . ; And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system .
Bmr021_793	So it was the same ; They came up with um you know , same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster ; Um , same The clustering used the same information loss threshold , ; which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall .
Bro017_968	Mm - hmm . ; And this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros . ; So we were getting uh when we did clustering , we were getting groups uh of features ; p Pretty new outliers , interesting outliers ,
Bmr026_46	So they 're just doing their own thing until ; Because I I need to ask Jane whether it 's it would be OK for her um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . ; We 're doing it in parallel , yeah . ; OK .
Bed002_364	Throw it all away . ; Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually . ; What ? ; Now I remember the email .
Btr002_3215	Right . ; It 's just like different ways of saying " and " . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr020_891	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , sure . ; Yeah , sure .
Bmr019_678	I got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data , that when people talk their words are usually chunked together . ; It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . ; They 're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? ; But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average .
Buw001_1635	uh , I need to email Adam or Jane , ; um , about getting the data . ; Who should I email ? ; Uh , how quickly do you want it ?
Bns001_1703	That would be great ! ; Over ; Like only over ether . ; carefully integrated for net
Bro028_688	or the right the right range . ; And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations . ; So it 's it 's , um , another way to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1728	the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do . ; Um , I I think that ; Let 's fall back to that . ; But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional
Bed010_1045	OK . ; So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably ; I I tho ; It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .
Buw001_458	Mm - hmm . ; because that that 's a lot of trouble ; Mm - hmm . ; and maybe it 's not the best way to do it .
Buw001_1154	Oh , OK . ; It 's already four - fifteen . ; I have like no recall memory . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_319	I think we had a very quick need to get something out ; and we 'd like to be able to do some later ; because just it 's inter it 's interesting . ; But as far a you know , uh , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project .
Bro003_1510	So , uh , it 's gonna take us ; It may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now , ; but , uh , ; we 're ,
Bed012_55	Yea - Are you talking are you talking about the the structure ? ; Well it ; I mean when you observe a node . ; When you when you say the input to the v Java Bayes , it takes a certain format ,
Bro028_201	and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other , ; which is essentially what 's happening , ; you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there . ; So you make use of both of them in in what you 're ending up with .
Bmr021_510	Every night . ; Is that right . ; That 's very strange . ; which is really weird .
Bsr001_1625	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , definitely . ; You p you plan to to train actually models based on this data . ; Mmm .
Bed010_291	And it was , uh It was fun to some extent , ; but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman ; um , I know that they enjoyed it here , ; and they r they they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here ,
Bed016_871	Oh , OK . ; I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes ; Oh , the thesis ! ; it 's just for one guy .
Btr002_3121	I can understand . ; Hmm ! ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_943	You you did get me to thinking about ; I I 'm not really sure which is more frequent , ; whether f f laughing ; I think it may be an individual thing . Some people are more prone to laughing when they 're speaking .
Bmr007_1230	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I agree . ; Yep .
Bed004_755	Oh , OK . ; Uh . ; then . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_346	I suggest you ask for their age ; and if they say I don't want to give it say OK . ; In in like the London - Lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1061	So that 's maybe the reason . ; Not me . ; And I 'm not I doubt that it 's not available in Germany . ; It 's would be unbelievable to me .
Bmr015_1129	I ; They have lots of experience with breathing ? ; Actually ; Well , yes they do ,
Bmr022_591	So ; so it 's p so it 's really just doing , yeah , a keyword , like a spotting for beep with ; Right . But it 'll it 'll grab the next beep , in other words . ; It 'll be
Bed016_305	how to get there , ; what actually is happening there today , ; and then maybe talk about the big picture here , ; e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story .
Bro012_35	Yeah . ; A simple thing to do is ; he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail , ; but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested .
Bro004_1304	Disk , and ; I think we 're alright , ; um , not much problems with that . ; OK .
Bro012_1019	There also could be I mean . I can maybe see a reason f for both working on it too ; if um you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction ; I mean it 's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module . ; So it 's it 's almost like everything 's held up waiting for this one thing .
Bmr020_1404	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; If ; Oh , OK .
Buw001_1562	It it doesn't ; Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " , ; you know , whatever . ; But but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query .
Btr002_975	But then when you go to type on your keyboard at home , ; Mm - hmm . You 're so scared , ; do you do this too ? ; I 'm so scared .
Bmr003_2381	It 's going next door . ; We jus ; I 'm serious , that that it it ; Yeah .
Bro027_932	Right ? ; In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all . ; Oh , yeah , I wasn't necessarily saying it should be better . ; I 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel
Bmr026_555	Right . ; An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .
Bmr014_1208	I mean i ; well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks . ; You know ? ; I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript ,
Bed002_616	So where would you get this information ? ; And , expand it to to other things like this . ; But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble . ; I mean th th i i if you can't do this task ,
Bmr019_58	if we had the if we had the telephone on the table ; No . ; But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something . ; No , actually I I have to I have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places .
Bmr011_869	but I just haven't had time yet . ; Sorry , what ? ; The the folks that they 're , uh , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters ; Yes .
Bed012_885	And not meet tomorrow ? ; Sure . ; OK . ; I 'll send an email ,
Bed013_1295	Mm - hmm . ; and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment . ; Um , but ; OK .
Bro024_988	Oh . ; So ; So I got actually just the results for the Italian for that ; and that 's like
Bro004_1441	Uh , we 're also gonna be collaborating with SRI ; and we have their have theirs . ; Um So I don't know ; Um . So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings , no matter what ,
Bro028_265	something that 's different . ; I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there . ; Uh - huh . ; But it may be something else
Bed012_777	The first bad version 'll be done in nine months . ; Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface ; and you can Keith can worry about the discourse . ; I mean , this is pretty Um , I mean , I I I hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values ,
Bmr016_575	And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , ; which you would expect ; but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , ; um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes .
Bro028_675	What could you do ? ; And , uh , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling , ; some sort of root or or something of the , um , uh , features . ; But the problem with that is that isn't quite the same ,
Bmr028_1368	Right . I 'm j Well , ; They can do experiments . ; you can do experiments , ; but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box .
Bro003_1134	Yeah . ; So it 's ; But Yeah . ; But there is the testing also , which implies training , uh , the HTK models
Bro003_145	So , s six AM , in front . ; OK . ; Six AM in front . ; OK .
Bro026_765	Hmm . ; Somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and ; ju Yeah , I th I think . ; Hmm .
Bro023_605	c ; Uh ; Can I ask just a a high level question ? ; Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ?
Bmr008_1566	Yeah . ; It 's based on uh a correlation between frame the utterance ; Yeah . ; but eh I don't know what is ehm eh
Bmr003_1941	b but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking ? ; No ; You 're talking about writing HTML , right ? ; Yeah .
Bed005_1046	That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . ; For example , they could be " time of day " , ; in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning , afternoon , evening , night " . ; So , this could be more
Bro005_1231	If we find ; uh ; I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L ; You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in .
Bmr006_490	That 's a good point . ; right ? ; Right , it can't be the internal one . ; Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone .
Bro016_561	it 's true . ; You know , maybe there 's parameters that other people have used ; you know , th that they have tuned in some way for other things . ; So it 's it 's , uh
Bro019_1655	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Great ! ; Well , welcome .
Bro012_1032	Was it ; There was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits , ; and ; Yeah . But I think they '
Bro013_487	There 's two things on the same graph . ; Yeah . ; I don't know . ; I I think that I have d another graph ,
Bro028_1108	Mm - hmm . ; And this is k sorta like ; Or the or features . ; Right ?
Bmr014_513	And I have t ten minute stretch where I can where I can show that . ; And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , ; and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . ; So um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up " gobbledy - gook " .
Bmr031_713	We should probably do that while we have the space left on the on the th the existing thirty - sixes , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; so that we can
Bmr014_956	Yeah . ; not just for fun , ; OK ? ; but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .
Bmr029_815	Right ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Does this th this ?
Bed004_318	Yep . ; And I separated them out . ; And then I um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot , ; um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer .
Bmr001_326	Yeah ; So I guess this a pretty dense group ; but it it 's getting a lot higher . ; Yeah , but But that it 's
Bmr007_409	I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . ; Well , we 've als ; And and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't . ; Right .
Bed011_383	but what we should be able to do ; and I don't know if , Fey , if you will have time to do this , ; but it would be great if you could , um , not transcribe it all , but pick out uh , some stuff . ; I mean we could lis uh just sit here and listen to it all .
Bed010_152	OK ? ; So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . ; If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great . ; You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .
Bdb001_723	Um , OK . ; Let me look at it again . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed003_1120	Yeah . ; Go up one ? ; Up one . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_789	uh , your volume is is greater . ; But but still , I mean , they they say ; I 've been eating a lot . ; I it makes their their job extremely easy .
Bed008_1250	So it 's not just a generalized situation like ; I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of ; we wanna view each of these as experts ; ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors
Bro005_305	Nnn , we don't know exactly . ; Yeah . ; And And um ; whatever the normalization , actually .
Bro021_598	and , uh ; and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase . ; But it looks like there 's ways that one could potentially just work with the complex numbers and and and in principle get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum . ; But
Bmr008_908	And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize ; and this will be a form a place for us to connect the two . ; And then the meetings that they attended , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1293	So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now . ; And so my next plan would be ; What what do they what do they cover ? ; They 're very minimal .
Bmr014_288	I I don't think it 'll take too long . ; So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect . ; So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . ; Right .
Bro028_33	OK . ; Uh , yeah . There were like two hours of discussions , ; and then suddenly , uh , people were tired , I guess , ; and they decided on a number ,
Bed012_278	OK . ; So you 've been working with these guys ? ; You know what 's going on ? ; Yes ,
Bmr011_994	you know , like we just did , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , um , here 's , uh , a a , uh , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_707	So that that 'll take some reading about the theory . ; I don't really know the theory . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , and um , another f first step is
Bed003_244	So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , ; because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th ; Want to do Vista , ; right ?
Bmr016_2266	yeah . ; uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated ; and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions . ; OK .
Bro023_957	i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , " well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation " . ; It 's just a thought . ; I d I don't know if it would be ; Yeah .
Bmr016_89	Well , we actually figured out a way to ; Yeah , the the ; the the groupings are randomly generated . ; No but , I was asking if that was something you really cared about
Bed009_39	Hi . ; Uh - huh . Nice to meet you . ; Hi . ; Hi .
Bmr030_33	Hmm . ; Alright . ; It 's , uh ; Doesn't say much .
Bsr001_1611	OK . ; So , ; sort of ; Right .
Bmr010_211	Fantastic . ; Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . ; So you have these twenty - four features . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1147	Right . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , don't don't worry about that . ; Yeah . ; So what we 're saying is , there 's no guarantee that , um ; So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed .
Bro003_1923	You 're using this for the feature generation , ; though , not the ; Yeah , but you will ask the net to put one for th th the phoneme class ; Yeah .
Bmr001_254	And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible . ; Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation , you sort of you want them very close . ; And And the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's but it 's there . ; Yeah .
Bro019_845	That 's wh ; Yeah . ; So , ; Right ,
Bmr016_666	but we wanted to know what would need to be done . ; And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . " ; And he We 've given him the data we have so far , ; so these sychronous cases where there are overlap .
Bsr001_2315	You - you 're encouraged to , you know , just utter digits once in a while . ; I was thinking ; Yeah . ; Never mind ,
Bmr001_549	Mm - hmm . ; I think it does that . ; Yeah , so , P Z ; Yeah , well .
Bro005_927	Yeah . ; So . And and when you add other things in to to broaden it , it gets worse uh typically . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bns001_992	Yeah . ; uh it 's a part of a of design like the the ; the terminal has a WAP stick . ; And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick .
Bmr025_375	Sorry . ; Today isn't June first , ; There 's another one . ; is it .
Bro024_244	a actually I was just thinking about what I was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the SmartKom system to do the mean subtraction . ; You said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances ; and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ? ; Can
Bmr006_1257	So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's uh , multiple people . ; OK . ; Wherever you are , even if he moves around . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1493	you saying that there 's an arrow right here ? ; Yeah ! ; OK . And then there 's an arrow right here ? ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr009_422	Consider different class of overlap ? ; Yeah , that we would be working on anyway . ; If there 's time . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1302	Yeah . ; And , so . Right . So . ; OK . This is consistent with um the role I had suggested that he he play , ; Ah .
Bmr026_265	S ; Yep . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1206	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Which was would be really good for funding purposes . ; Right .
Btr001_2759	what we could do is we could do it together one week ; Whatever . ; and then separate the next ; or something like that
Bmr023_388	so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours ; and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . ; And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um Um . ; So they really appreciate it .
Bro023_525	Um , ; so , it 's like ; So it 's the close - talking microphone . ; Yeah ,
Bed003_1800	And uh nothing has changed since then , ; so . ; Uh . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this , ; and especially since um Johno can't stop Tango - ing , we may actually include , you know , those those intentions .
Bed013_652	Yeah , that is something for the rest of the gang to to g ; The thing with the goats and the helicopters ? ; Change the watchband . ; It 's time to walk the sheep .
Bmr030_152	You have olt Alt Tab and ; Hold down at hold down Alt , ; and then tap Tab several times ; and you 'll cycle through all the open applications .
Bmr030_468	But ; Yeah , but you ; Yeah . Pfff . Yeah . ; Right . It 's not a big deal .
Bmr003_2571	Uh , ; using using these ; And it and the f the five thousand for the wires , ; so if I 'm gonna do
Bmr007_499	in which case that those might there may be no upper bound on those . ; I I have a feeling that backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard , uh , don't play as big a role here , because it 's very unnatural I think , to backchannel if in a multi - audience you know , in a multi - person audience . ; If you can see them , actually . ; It 's interesting ,
Bmr011_1597	All America , OK . ; yeah . ; It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of ; I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way ,
Bmr018_516	Yeah . ; oh , oh , ; get you can get the , uh you can get it to switch audio ? ; Yeah .
Bed004_215	Well , you 'll have to . ; Right . ; So anyway , ; N
Bro025_139	Yeah . ; I need to allow it to do everything and even more more than this . ; Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of ; Right .
Btr001_2771	OK . ; OK . ; OK . ; OK ,
Bmr018_166	that we 've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out ? ; He 's he 's ; He generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting , ; but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ?
Btr001_932	Yep . ; Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; and then " PRN " , ; And then in the brackets , what it
Bmr023_354	and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to . ; Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event ; and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way ; in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs
Bdb001_308	But it 's still a lot tighter than than ASCII . ; And we have a lot of tools already to deal with it . ; You do ? ; OK .
Bed011_785	" Little money , some money , lots of money " ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Actually , maybe uh F uh so , F ; Yeah , OK .
Bro003_609	Mm - hmm . ; and so . ; Well , we have that now , too , right ? ; I don't know .
Buw001_1343	Mm - hmm . ; I 've gotta come back and follow up on it " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1559	There 's no way . ; OK . ; We won we wanna I mean , they 're there 's gonna be , uh , Jeff , Katrin , Mari and two students . ; So there 's five from there .
Bmr027_181	OK . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
Bmr030_23	So Morgan 's working on that . ; So , I mean , it 's good news . ; It 's not as good as it could have been ; but it was , uh
Bed010_277	Yeah . ; It 's alright . ; Um . Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is , ; Maybe you 're done , then .
Bro013_91	Mm - hmm . ; but but uh , ; uh , you know . ; But , yeah , so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement ,
Btr002_3034	but if I can tell something if somebody goes " r " I 'll put an " R " . ; Oh , I see . ; I see . ; Eh Um , so if they go " r e m m " , I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " .
Btr001_2140	I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing . ; I mean , computer people speech thing , ; but um , ; Hmm .
Bns002_730	mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; And they are controlling the power to eh this g uh mmm get this this number of neighbors , ; but this is not what I am doing
Bmr026_430	and we won't be using the old ones anymore . ; Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG . ; I have a lot of space , though . ; Uh Oh thats XA Oh that 's X
Bed003_111	The context , which in this case we 've limited to " business person " , " tourist " , or " unknown " , ; the time of day , ; and " open to suggestions " , isn't actually a feature . ; It 's " We are open to suggestions . "
Bmr002_1150	So . ; Right . ; Right . ; OK ,
Bro022_241	Uh ; Y Yeah . ; I I I I don't know . ; So , it 's this room .
Bro021_227	Even if the general kind is the same , the exact instances are different . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and ; so when you whiten it , then it 's like you the the only noise to to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise
Bed010_730	The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , " where is it ? " , ; they do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Give them a stick , long stick , and say " do it " ,
Bed002_734	So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like s using a device ? ; Uh , ; N no , no not ; i it was mobile
Bmr031_800	Yeah . ; OK . ; Any other items ? ; So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff .
Bmr020_312	Yeah . ; You have a lot of a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting . ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bro025_65	Um , it should be ready , uh , very soon . ; Um , and we ; So what 's what 's happened ? ; I think I 've missed something .
Bro027_1904	and ; and ; Yeah . ; And then anyway we would have to reduce this with the KLT .
Btr001_796	Oh , I see . ; Oh , OK . ; Unlike like a " tuh " or a " kuh " that just stops . ; Yeah .
Bed005_308	Right . ; It 's a match . ; So that 's the main purpose . Alright . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_704	t t results similar results , like , eh , the paper , eh , that I I am following . ; But , eh , the the rules , eh , that , eh , people used in the paper to to distinguish the harmonics , is doesn't work well . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I I I not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right ,
Bmr016_1447	" UH " . ; Oh . ; or the " UH " , " EH " , " AH " were all the same . ; And then , we have this additional non - native version of uh , like " eeh " .
Buw001_1417	Yeah . ; Importance ? ; generati generating an interesting summary , um ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_132	and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . ; OK . ; He 's interested in these these knowledge structures , ; Yeah , interesting .
Btr002_1652	So I 'm going " OK . " ; " I 'm just gonna listen to you . " ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2992	but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is , ; Mm - hmm . ; then indicate what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized , uh , parts when there are words involved , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1370	Well ; That would be pretty pretty ; i it has ; Yeah .
Bed015_93	You 'll say " I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here " ; or " I need a directional specifier here " . ; So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . ; Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type .
Btr002_2364	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Or , " That 's it . " ; Yeah .
Bed015_1371	Mm - hmm . ; The context we need . ; Um , so anyway , Keith ; So is this comfortable to you
Bmr028_1131	Yeah . ; Right . Then you can do like an you can estimate the the noise estimates . ; Noise estimate . ; Signal to noise .
Bmr016_1773	" tickle " is pronounced " tickle " ? ; I 'm sorry ! ; So I think it 's the language model that makes it different . ; Oh , sorry .
Bed004_741	we didn't We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I think that 's OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_122	They 're separate things . ; their being nice w ; feature . ; OK .
Bmr016_288	It - it 's different people is the is the core thing . ; So . ; And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , ; OK , fine .
Bmr002_1374	I mean notice that n ; Well . ; your you you stood up and walked around . ; None of the rest of us have .
Bdb001_546	So ; Well , if you look at it ; and Um , ; I guess in my mind I don't know enough Jane would know better , about the types of annotations
Bro014_1313	I can't see you now . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_220	and found that the , ; uh , ; you know , as you might expect the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap ; uh , but next were Switchboard and CallHome ,
Bmr008_1626	You can also look at just the voiced regions later . ; I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure . ; because you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um , you should be much more sensitive to the to the overlaps then if you ; Yeah .
Bro024_85	So , um , I 'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page . ; And I 'll mention it in my status report if people wanna take a look . ; You could clarify something for me . ; You 're saying point three percent ,
Bed005_368	Yeah . ; Yeah , where are those constructors defined ? ; Oh . ; Nope .
Bed013_1069	Or any variants of that . ; Yeah . ; No ! ; Um , look at it this way ,
Bed010_414	If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we we need to solve right now . ; What I 'm what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of of the internal structure . ; Maybe node by node , or something like this ? ; Or should I collect it all
Bro012_238	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's I think it 's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh it just being very ; and I think you mentioned this in your email too ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr027_365	Maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ? ; No . ; No . ; We have what they put on the speaker form ,
Bmr019_204	One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK ; Hmm . ; this , you know , very limited training HTK system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_695	and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that ; rather than ; and sometimes people ; even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better .
Bed014_443	Great , ; Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole that 's fine . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr028_744	Yeah ? OK . ; We store we store our data on Popcorn . ; Anything else ? ; That 's really great .
Bro014_1595	But but , uh ; S ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro028_397	And so it it isn't ; But ; But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal . ; There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away .
Bro016_1170	OK . ; So , he looks at interesting interesting things in in the different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr027_329	Mm - hmm . ; if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , ; but that 's it " . ; I I kind of like this .
Bmr003_1819	Yeah . ; No . ; OK , ; good .
Bed002_1226	let 's say XML , that says , l you know , " These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . " ; We can just add to that ; and there 'll be this this file of them ; and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um this data file .
Bro017_112	It uh ; Oh , but you still have that with the MFCC . ; OK . ; Y yeah .
Bmr019_910	Oh , good . ; I I mean the the one with Dan Ellis in it and Eric . ; Good ! ; Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah .
Btr001_1506	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; God , it must take them a really long time to do these . ; Hmm .
Btr001_2762	or something like that ; Sure . ; to give the variety . ; Sure .
Bmr014_1223	You probably won't listen to it . ; Yeah . ; It is true that tec that the content is technical , ; I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which
Bmr002_189	Right . So the first task is to read some digits . ; Before that . ; Yeah . ; So I 'll go ahead and start .
Bmr026_752	Mm - hmm . ; and I 'd you know , where do we go from here kind of things and ; So , it would be good . ; Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the uh the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best
Bro027_777	Probably half . ; Good ! ; Um , ; Yeah .
Bro017_1181	if we mail to " Aurora - inhouse " , does that go up to you guys also ? ; I don't think so . ; No . ; No .
Bmr025_660	I know that uh that Thilo you were , um , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? ; Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , ; And I wanted to know is th ; yeah .
Bed003_343	Mm - hmm . ; That was like our example . ; That was the initial one that we found . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_881	I see . ; it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise . ; So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a ; Wiener filtering .
Bro024_406	that 's ; So you can always ; Yeah . ; The other thing is that and and I I remember B B N doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick ,
Bro026_754	yeah , this i ; yeah . ; what ? ; Yeah .
Bro021_928	Yeah . ; And , well , ; And , log of ; uh , we can say that E is equal to log of , um , exponential of X plus exponential of N .
Bmr019_706	You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end . ; Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , ; and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , ; where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that
Bro018_602	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; Um , i i if is it eh w ; When is nearest - neighbor good ?
Bro027_1615	So the the di the biggest ; The problem f for me was to find a consistent threshold that works well across the different databases , ; because I t I try to make it work on tr SpeechDat - Car ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_692	Now we bought a little not all that long ago we brought three uh , thirty - six gigabyte disks . ; That 's the un - backed - up . ; Yeah . Those are the u ; Yeah , we 're using those for the for the expanded .
Bsr001_628	where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera . ; Mm - hmm . ; At the same time , our process is somehow , you know , getting all this multi - channel information , doing some sort of , you know , cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and transcribing the individual streams , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_444	Yeah . ; Well , it seems like just shortening them is a good short - term solution ; Yeah , yeah . ; so we don't have to do any coding .
Bmr029_330	I mean , a lot of the evaluations have been ; We have MR ; two , th We have two , three , four , fi ; I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with .
Bed014_612	It would already be higher in the context . ; th that th the the the conditional probability that someone ; So at the time you mentioned it ; This is this is essentially the Bayes - net equivalent of the spreading activation .
Bmr012_320	Oh , interesting . ; Oh OK ; so that 's ; Hmm .
Bro007_433	Yeah . ; And so ; right , ; it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases
Bro023_752	So . ; So that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ? ; Yeah , ; so far I 've seen sixty - seven
Bro004_509	And , ; yeah . ; Actually I I uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives ; uh but with increased frame numbers .
Bmr024_1088	if ; Well we 're g we 're gonna automate that . ; OK . ; My intention is to do a script that 'll do everything .
Bed002_47	Well , we can start doing it . ; Thanks . ; So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . ; All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly ,
Bmr015_1057	but you it 's real data . ; You don't wanna b but you don't ; OK , well ; If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting ,
Bmr016_1019	did they Jane ? ; What 's th u w in what respect ? ; Loading the long ; They loaded they loaded the long long files into X Waves .
Bro018_785	Mm - hmm . ; I expect you could do that . ; I mean uh ; Uh .
Buw001_2285	When when did people laugh ? ; That 's great . ; Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . ; So we need a laugh detector .
Bed010_86	and it was It was a lot of engineering stuff . ; No science in there whatsoever , ; but it 's working now , ; and um , that 's the good news .
Bmr019_257	Right . ; But but , I would ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's easy enough to try ,
Bro026_557	Right . ; Um . ; Have you ever ? ; Very good question .
Bro024_1807	well . ; If we put everything , we improve a lot u the spectral use of the VTS ; but the final result are not still mmm , good like the Wiener filter for example . ; I don't know .
Bmr005_558	Mm - hmm . ; It 's low . ; It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone . ; Yep .
Bro003_1789	Mm - hmm . ; Another year . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Btr002_198	Actually , that comes back to a point . ; We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in " so " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Saying " so " at the end of something .
Bro016_766	Mm - hmm . ; But ; Yeah . ; But , it 's d it 's after
Bed013_567	Oh . ; Is that what you s ; OK . Four pages is , like , really not very much space . ; I don't know
Bsr001_753	Yeah . ; So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power . ; Right . ; I mean , the the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance .
Bmr025_663	yeah . ; It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . Great . ; Yeah . ; Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work .
Bmr014_204	OK . ; Yeah . ; Um , That 's the only thing with them . ; But the quality seems really good
Btr002_3348	The only tags that you need to add , is ; So th uh , there 's like one exception that 's just microscopic , ; and that is , sometimes ; this is again really rare ,
Bro004_934	It 's one net with um twenty - seven outputs ; if we have twenty - seven classes , ; I see . ; yeah .
Bed015_450	OK , so ; Oh , so there was one question that came out . ; I hate this thing . ; Sorry .
Bro014_67	So what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model . ; Yeah . ; Oh , right ! ; This was the mix up stuff .
Bro024_531	And ; uh , ; ps the fifty - six percent is like comparable to what the French Telecom gets , ; but the thirty - five percent is way off .
Bmr028_821	So it 's just , uh ; Five more processors . ; Oh , I know what it was ; Uh . Yeah .
Bmr007_1084	you know , profusely . ; Oh , yeah , that 's really common . ; Yeah . ; Ah .
Bed008_656	And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , we could . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_860	Right . ; Does that matter ? ; Yeah . ; Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing .
Bro019_1562	Well you get these complex pairs . ; And it depends on the order that you 're doing , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro023_530	the close - talking without ; Oh , oh , oh , oh . ; So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only w I mean , the same endpoints . ; But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one ,
Bsr001_1913	Really ? ; Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be . ; Oh , sure . ; If they know that
Btr001_1576	because it 's already there ; so you don't have to pay as much attention . ; That 's true . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_205	So that 's why Chuck was suggesting different tones . ; My original thought was , you could have a different tone for each speaker . ; You know , there 's plenty of tone space . ; And that might help cue the transcriptionist .
Bmr015_85	The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ? ; My opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , ; and have them read again by someone else . ; You know , the grouping is completely random ,
Btr002_1507	Mmm . ; I 've never used been able to use that ; cuz it I s feel like it skips such huge portions . ; Maybe we have resolution set totally different .
Bmr016_182	like , you know , " six sixty - one would be read as six one " . ; Right . ; And I think people will get it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1212	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; It 's it 's let 's say it 's six hours or eight hours , or something for the training of HTK . ; How long is it for training of of , uh , the neural net ?
Bro010_798	Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , ; just , uh , things that that we 've been chatting about ; but haven't made it into these meetings yet . ; So you 're coming up with your quals proposal ,
Bmr023_582	if we could count on them listening . ; But no one will listen to the hours and hours of ; Talk . ; Well , that 's O K .
Btr001_703	I see . ; Really ? ; it 's a very slight difference , ; and then the time bin starts .
Bro003_644	Yeah , ; I have the wireless . ; Yeah , ; so you can walk around .
Bmr010_1302	so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap . ; Yeah . ; Um , I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be , ; Yeah .
Bed005_614	does this make sense to you ? ; Or ; Yeah . Especially if we want ; Sort of , what I my feeling was eh we we sort of reserved something that has a r eh an OK label .
Bmr031_530	Really ? ; They 're recording fifty channels of mikes . ; They 're not recording all fifty of the array . ; They 're they 're cooking it down ,
Bmr006_1756	Mm - hmm . ; And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . ; But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how ; Making some decisions ?
Bdb001_486	or ? ; The last time I looked at it was a while ago , ; probably a year ago , ; Hmm .
Bro014_791	So there is this KLT part , which use just the standard features , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; and then two neura two neural networks .
Bns001_1172	Yeah . That 's ; But So that 's the big problem . ; That is a ; But the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too big
Bmr005_444	for forty - five minutes . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1023	or ; Yeah . ; Thirteen ? ; th th
Bed004_883	Litonya was good . ; Yeah ? ; The uh um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses ; Right .
Bmr027_533	And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something ; and they wouldn't actually hear from us , ; and then they find this thing is in there ; and we 've already distributed it to someone .
Btr001_1577	so you don't have to pay as much attention . ; That 's true . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr021_497	Yeah , after each meeting we copy the data to ; Except that ; Well , I mean , so the wavefiles , or or anything at all , because the transcripts are there as well . ; The wave files .
Bmr020_549	There 's no statement about cause and effect . ; Yeah , ; This is just a statistical correlation , ; right .
Bdb001_1171	I mean , most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with , you know , uh , time alignments and stuff . ; So ; So the the the point is ; Should should we mention some names on the people who are n ?
Bmr007_181	Uh - huh . ; And ; Yeah , exactly ! ; Exactly !
Bro024_1052	which is like a four on either side , ; Nine - point . ; which is like ; OK .
Bsr001_2262	And and I think , you know , there are always gonna be backchannels , ; I think that 's natural and lovely . ; Mm - mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_622	Mm - hmm . ; you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline , ; just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_38	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean ; Right .
Bmr010_1339	Yeah . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I think that , eh , the possibility , eh , can be that , eh ,
Bro010_1099	Yeah , ; so that 's ; yeah , ; that 's , you know , a neat neat thing
Bmr001_339	OK . ; But . ; So uh so where are we uh now ? ; I mean so we 've just uh We 're doing this recording so we show we can we 're capable of doing recording
Bmr012_498	Yeah so ; Oh that 's I 'm glad . ; It got all two genders ? ; Yeah
Bmr022_291	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So I think , certainly , doing two beeps is is no - brainer . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1454	The other thing one could do is Couldn't ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , it 's So you have two categories ; and you have Markov models for each .
Bmr018_671	And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something . ; But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and it was a nice uh , you know , it it was zero was the most of them , ; Yeah . ; A normal .
Bmr026_952	yeah . ; But then ; And then something ; Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features
Bsr001_176	The solo actually ; So you can feed it to the ; Solo means you just ; Ahh .
Bed008_1166	you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different uh ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . ; Alright . ; So we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them . ; But um What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer
Bmr003_1718	Oh , yes , ; I I wanted to have ; So sometimes a pers I uh ; in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions , it 's i it isn't just words coming out ,
Bmr029_700	Yeah . ; and then create the finally , the mean subtracted , um , little files . ; And then I can get rid of the big files . ; But st while I 'm doing the processing , I 'll nee I need twice as much disk space .
Bed003_1435	It 's amazing what human beings can do . ; W when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station ; and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says New York ; and you say Track seven ,
Bmr016_654	because of insertion ; Insertions aren't bounded , ; so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . ; Uh - huh .
Bro012_374	right ? ; Yeah but what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H HMK 's , ; uh like five percent uh absolute , ; and this will not affect the final score almost
Bmr010_573	Uh - huh . ; Well , uh , my suggestion now is is on all of these things to , uh , contact Brian . ; OK . I 'll do that . ; This is wonderful to have a direct contact like that .
Bmr016_1928	Now you already know i that I had , uh , in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers , I put " numbers " in place of any kind of numbers , ; but there are places where they , ; um , it th this convention came later ; an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers .
Bns003_550	So it 's just a su suggestion ; I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that . ; Yeah . ; Huh !
Bmr026_50	Yep . ; Um and we want it You know , we need ; The Again , we we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich ; and get it transcribed and get it back .
Bmr005_964	Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files . ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; Oh , that 's right , that had those have not been sent .
Bmr018_1437	Maryland . ; um , I wo it was ; Columbia have anything ? ; No .
Bns003_641	This is that from from Mark , right ? ; No , ; in ; Not ?
Bed015_534	The information in the sentence tells you that much ; but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it what the point of doing so is . ; So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be ; like the question is for example , what does " Watergate " refer to there ?
Bmr025_532	u ; on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro005_1124	u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , ; um Suppose we said , " OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , ; but PLP seems pretty good . " ; If we take the approach that Mike did and have
Btr002_2094	Yeah . ; Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored . ; Yep . Or , like , I 'll think ; Right . It 's something you 're not interacting with ,
Bro021_855	is the estimate of the PDF of the noise signal ; when we have a , um , a statistic of the clean speech and an statistic of the noisy speech . ; And the clean speech the statistic of the clean speech is from a codebook . ; Mmm ? This is the idea .
Bed002_455	I have one more point to to Bhaskara 's question . ; Um , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . ; We can start , you know , basic from human beings , ; model that ,
Bmr009_1414	Be easier on the subjects . ; I think that 's fine . ; So . ; No .
Bro011_763	um four point something or . ; If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff ; The basic stuff , right . ; that 's perfect .
Bed013_1317	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's like you infer the speaker intent , ; and then infer a plan , a larger plan from that , for which you have the additional information , ; Yeah .
Bed015_1523	And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to . ; So that 's " I " ; but , uh , uh , should we say it it refers to , what ? ; Uh , if it were " Harry " it would refer to like some ontology thing .
Bed005_773	Trying to ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; And , again , it 's just a question of which of these things , uh , people want to dive into .
Bmr025_954	I don't know . ; Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , ; as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . ; The point is that we haven't used it at all
Btr001_2712	You can say one or the other ? ; Yes , ; mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed003_1695	Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , ; see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . ; And I talked to Liz about this ; and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data .
Bro012_778	Where where is it ? ; Where is the word ? ; Uh - huh . ; This is this is ,
Buw001_491	and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? " ; Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . ; I 'd have to get started someplace . ; So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting ,
Bns002_518	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this node should hear it before . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2137	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr009_1433	Cockney ? ; CO ; N E ; Yeah .
Bmr020_83	There 's an agenda ? ; I sort of condensed the three things you said into that . ; And then just I only have like , this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before I go to Japan for ten days . ; So if there 's anything that n absolutely , desperately needs to be done , you should let me know now .
Bmr011_770	So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , ; and and and so ; Uh - huh . ; And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases .
Bmr018_1703	And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about , uh , the exact details of the algorithms . ; And and then you hit this ; Except when they have a Eurospeech paper . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_224	So does the recognizer . ; Oh , really ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1389	Right . ; But but but but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences , uh , between the two . ; Course . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1102	what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things . ; Huh . ; Right . ; What kind of , uh , hypotheses have has this caused you
Bmr024_322	well , not a small number ; only a subset of that has been transcribed . ; And so we need to decide what we wanna do . ; And , uh , Liz and Andreas actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment .
Bed015_1105	And it 's unclear whether ; I mean , you could just have in your scenario , " here are some extra few things that are true " , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ?
Bmr028_1231	But it does help to get the backchannels back in , and things like that . ; Right . ; So , whenever the Right now , the s the scoring is based on segments . ; Um , which is not great
Bmr016_2165	OK . ; But if if you know , and I and he 's gonna give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_445	with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames . ; Mm - hmm . ; Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise ; and then I found that it works
Buw001_519	this one being different , ; but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop ; Um , you can just make it be on a laptop , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1168	So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? ; Yeah . ; But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour . ; And the question is what 's the difference
Btr002_998	or vice versa ; it 's just , uh it 's like I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different , ; Or vice versa , yeah . ; and I have to just get used just get used to it again
Bmr031_482	Yeah . ; Yeah . It 's four or five times . ; And it 's , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_475	Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . ; Adjusting ? ; Yeah , exactly . ; Scoot the voicing over a little , because
Bmr014_489	Right . ; And uh , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running ; and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet ; cuz I 'm working
Bro027_1549	Mm - hmm . ; but Um . ; I mean , part of why ; I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ?
Bmr011_603	Mm - hmm . ; But , e I think for ; I mean , how we 're gonna decide ; For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .
Bro021_703	So . ; OK . ; So , it was real ; I mean , I thought it was all fine
Bed010_187	But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain , ; Mm - hmm . ; but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being . ; Yeah .
Bns002_926	In the same way , at as as it happened with with processors , for example . ; Now processors are much more uh power efficient than before . ; OK ? ; Yeah , but anyway , that was the reason for my question .
Bmr024_367	Um , or we could try some automated methods . ; And my my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it . ; Well ; Yeah , it 's Y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically
Bmr002_1403	I do find myself whispering . ; I mean , I suspect My normal s . ; Why ? ; I don't know why .
Bed012_253	That 's the one that 's painful . That hurts . It hurts so bad . ; I 'm h I 'm happy that they 're recording that . ; That headphone . The headphone that you have to put on backwards , with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it ? ; It 's a painful , painful microphone .
Bro005_117	Ah , yes . ; Uh , @ @ with SPINE ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data ,
Bmr010_1375	Uh ; Mm - hmm . ; the to speech - nonspeech as ; I think with
Btr001_980	Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that they should be able to handle themselves ,
Buw001_1030	Mm - hmm . ; because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . ; Running to ; Yeah ,
Bed013_130	Cuz that 's basically what needs to be added to the system for it . ; Well , look at th ; eee , I think even think even ; What it would be the the prior intention .
Bmr009_723	no ? ; yeah . ; Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow , ; There you go .
Bmr026_439	Yeah ; not for long . ; But I mean it 's not going f ; Maybe I 'm confu
Bro004_993	Yeah . ; Right . ; Whether you would transform together or just one . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1103	There you go . ; Oh , much better . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed003_1258	However these are of course then ; the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . ; So this again points to " final destination " , " doing business " , " tourist hurry " and so forth . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_287	Um , because my name was was mentioned when I wasn't around , ; but I 'm most happy . ; OK . ; Oh really ?
Bro028_92	No . ; OK . ; It 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the MIPs , I think it fits , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_90	Yeah . ; OK , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Alrighty .
Bed006_847	OK these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role . ; Right , so the the the roles will be filled in with the schema ; Hmm ? ; OK , go it .
Bmr001_79	Just write it down . ; What are we why are we writing it down ? ; So that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing . ; Oh .
Bro011_589	So my guess uh ; And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case , ; and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . ; So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits
Bro026_920	Mmm . ; So that 's th that 's the hard thing . ; I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . ; And it 's something that you really think you can pick up .
Bro011_498	if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? ; Is it sonorant in that band ? ; Is it sonorant in that band ? ; Right .
Bmr031_658	Most of them . ; All of them are like that . ; Yep . So they won't shorten nearly as well . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1469	so it 's not a not a issue for ; Yeah . ; It 's only ; Them Canadians .
Bed006_1670	Well the the the binding is technically no problem ; but it 's it for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s if if there if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature , ; we should distill them out ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1923	Oh , forget this ! ; Well , but that 's not very much . ; I One less action item . ; I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders .
Bro005_1014	Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? ; Mmm , ; Um . ; And y
Bro011_647	just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . ; Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . ; Mm - hmm . ; Not do anything that 's really finely tuned ,
Btr002_2503	I would say " tongue click " for that . ; Yeah . ; But I would also probably put in parentheses it that I thought it was a vocal gesture . ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_592	it 's starting to grow on me ; and it 's night . ; And the time of day is night ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr002_970	Boy , the recognition on what you just mumbled is going to be really horrible . ; Yeah . ; It 's the French one . ; Oh , cool !
Bmr009_1373	It does seem ; U ; I mean . I I would think that these categories would be more w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself . ; I think that that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst .
Bed015_2156	But we 'll we 'll have to see . ; Uh ; But , uh , ; Yes .
Bed010_164	You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in . ; Right . ; OK . ; So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us
Bmr003_1299	Yeah . ; and this is a way which meshes well with with , uh , making it so that , uh , you know , on the At the ; Yeah . ; Boy , it 's such a nice interface .
Bmr020_307	Right ? ; Cuz not everybody talks . ; Because you ; Right .
Bmr016_1953	So you say , " Seve - seventy eight point two " , or whatever . ; And there 's no way of capturing that if you 're putting the numbers off to the side . ; You can't have the seven and ; So what 's to the left of these ?
Bmr013_961	If it 's not then we 're really then we def definitely ; Yeah . ; uh , but for free recognition I 'm it 'll probably not be good enough . ; We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things .
Bro008_505	About ; Anything ; About other experiments ? ; Uh , now , I 'm interested in , um , uh looking at the experiments where you use , um uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net .
Bro027_1844	because it 's it has a high rate energy ; No . ; the VAD has a ; Ah .
Bed005_551	There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? ; No , this is very straightforward . ; Great . ; So this is just trying to
Bmr008_1464	to to begin to work with the eh with the one single channel . Now . ; I have another another thought . ; Um , this is this is frame energy , ; of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them
Bed009_771	Mm - hmm . ; And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors ; and ; OK .
Bmr012_883	There 's one level that 's already happening right here . ; OK . ; This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs ; Oh .
Bro028_747	Uh , w what do you mean when you say " what kind " ? ; Is it ? ; Um , is it like a Gaussian mixture model ? ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1022	OK on the uh ; are we done with that ? ; So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , ; so I got a quote
Bmr027_93	You said you wanted it to be available then . ; OK . ; Right . ; I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline .
Bmr003_1632	that 's a fine idea . ; Then , so question mark colon is fine for that . ; That 's a fine idea . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_2189	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; so we have no problem with that . ; I mean , there is no LDC database .
Bro017_211	And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically . ; Hmm . ; But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down , ; but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much ,
Bro016_633	No . ; Well not just expensive . ; I I I don't see how you could possibly do it . ; You can't look at the whole utterance and do anything . You know , you can only
Bro021_724	and then I told him . ; And then he gave me a whole bunch of filters ; what Carlos used for his , uh , uh , thesis ; and then that was something which came up .
Bmr028_1716	You know , maybe if we could pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting 's content . ; Uh - huh . ; Instead of losing the content altogether . ; Well , it 's even If y if you could still transcribe the words based on the far - field microphone or something , you could , uh , still use it for , say , language modeling ,
Buw001_417	but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? " ; And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for .
Bro014_1591	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's
Bro023_1233	And it 's not a bad thing to do . ; It 's another approach . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_417	Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , ; And then you ca then you can do a s ; Yeah . ; i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier .
Bed010_890	Oh , OK . ; You don't have a hidden purist streak ? ; Oh no . ; OK .
Bed015_2133	P R Ms - uh , PRM ; I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net ; Beca - because it b because ; No , no , you can't .
Btr002_2870	yeah . ; And so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more . ; And ch what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been , ; they were just very small ,
Bmr020_822	OK . ; Alright , then I 'll hold off on that and I 'll wait for you ; um ; Probably by tomorrow
Bmr001_29	Oh , hang on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it is at the moment . ; OK .
Bmr023_266	Yeah . Huh ! Maybe . ; And she said it wasn't gonna the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep . ; OK . ; So for them it 'll be very quick
Btr002_1334	Yeah . ; I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked . ; Mmm . ; But it was difficult finding them for some reason .
Bro010_1004	Mm - hmm . ; I don't remember that . ; Hmm . ; That would that 's
Buw001_134	And the other things , people can write whatever they want . ; I mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit . ; So , ; if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .
Bro022_216	uh , at n ; And , ; um , ; what if you did ?
Bmr005_1202	I think it 's hard to record those . ; To be allowed to record them ? ; Yeah , people will get ; OK .
Bro019_1636	That 's sort of the point . ; But Yeah . ; i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban uh , formant centers are ; Yeah .
Bmr023_450	Yeah . ; Um . ; You know , a completely non - cheating version . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_775	that 's what I 'm doing now . ; And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate the P - files I need . ; Cuz we already have the feature files in the SRI format . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_37	So what are you doing ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , uh , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . ; To improve
Bro023_777	so we c ; so I mean , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the VAD ; Yes . ; we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better .
Bmr027_1463	That was ; Dodged that bullet . ; Yeah . Nicely done , Liz . ; A woman of few words .
Bro014_1007	But each one of the mixture components ; Yeah . ; I mean , you have , uh , uh , variance only , ; so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , um , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture .
Bro016_1125	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed005_1369	Let 's assume there are only twenty object types in this world . ; And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings . ; So , in a sense , " I " used as Institutions for some s in some sense or the other . ; Which makes them enterable . Right ?
Bmr027_1479	So . ; Yeah . ; But , we haven't actually ; And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process
Bmr003_1999	I 'm not sure how how important that distinction is . ; I don't think we should say , " oh , it 's internal ; therefore we don't have to make it very good " . ; I mean , you can say " oh oh , it 's internal
Bro022_63	Oh , oh , you mean the the quals . ; The quals . ; Yeah . ; Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth .
Btr002_854	Yeah . ; I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time . ; Mmm . ; And that I would it would crack a lot .
Btr002_2306	I don't erase the " um " 's and " uh " 's , ; I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , ; and " And they 're ; I don't know .
Bed009_169	well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data . ; Yeah obviously . ; um um Not this type of data , ; no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such
Bro019_229	If you " Run command " , that I mentioned before , is doesn't know about other things that you might be running . ; Uh - huh . ; So , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , ; Right .
Bed011_806	S so I think there are a variety of things in which um ; Tour - tourists really do have different styles eating . ; Another one , ; you know .
Bro012_442	Like ; Like , it 's difficult to say ; because again ; um I 'm not sure I have the
Bro022_203	if you ; if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , ; and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . ; So , what what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero
Bsr001_641	but worse , you know , environmental conditions . ; Worse acoustics . ; Yeah . ; An - and then , you know , there is , all all these issues about processing all this information , you know , transcription ,
Bro017_848	I mean , no , the If you set it to a mean , that would ; No , you can't do that . ; Oh , that 's true , ; Y you ca you ca Ch - Chuck , you can't do that .
Bed014_111	Just gonna be you know ; Oh ! ; You were gonna send me a note about hiring ; Yes .
Bmr009_1578	So I I don't think it 'll be bad . ; So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people , ; and it 's likely that uh ; So . And and they responded favorably
Bed012_536	Right . ; Show us the way , Bhaskara . ; I guess the other thing is that um , yeah . ; I mean , when you 're asked a specific question and you don't even
Btr002_927	Mm - hmm . ; yeah , dragging is really f efficient . ; But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_586	Yeah . ; And the noise is different in th ; And perhaps the noise are quite different from the noises in the speech that Italian . ; Do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the Aurora ?
Bmr020_1853	Yeah , I think if we just m send it all to them . ; you know . ; Good . ; Worry about it when we get back .
Bmr008_797	But Other is there , and people will fill that out . ; e But do you think those three are OK ? ; They 'll see by example . ; Yeah that 's I think that 's fine ,
Bmr028_735	Temporarily . ; So . ; They 're stored on Popcorn . ; This is on Popcorn ? Or ?
Bro017_881	Yeah , multiply this component uh i it by number b larger than one , ; Mm - hmm . ; and you put your data in power higher than one . ; Then it becomes more important . In the overall score , I believe .
Bmr028_318	It 's always exciting to hear that Java 's faster than something . ; Yeah . ; Well , e everything is faster than Tcl - TK . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1066	Mm - hmm . ; So I did . ; And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now written in Java ; and it comes up , you know , in a couple of seconds .
Bmr002_962	I 'm sure I 'm sure It 's a TCL - based thing . ; I 'm sure it 's just wonderful . ; Cool . ; Cool .
Bmr002_1146	Right . ; Right . ; But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table . ; Right .
Bmr010_191	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all ,
Btr002_2991	And of course , potentially they 're codable , ; but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is , ; Mm - hmm . ; then indicate what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized , uh , parts when there are words involved ,
Bsr001_639	Mm - hmm . ; you know , ; but worse , you know , environmental conditions . ; Worse acoustics .
Bmr025_180	Guess who I practice on ? ; At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , ; that keeps coming up . ; Yeah .
Bed005_698	And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure . ; W we 'll we 'll look at that , ; but uh ; I 'd be s I I 'd be surprised at
Bmr025_475	how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? ; Yeah . ; The square bracket . ; Cuz I mean I haven't been putting it in
Bro026_613	Using our features . ; Yeah , ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bmr019_1903	Why don't we do a simultaneous one ? ; OK . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed012_185	the nicest way , ; use a cab , ; or so s ; wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there , because he wants to visit t it or whatever .
Bmr016_1885	glosses . ; because you see " beep " ; Right . ; and you know I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling ,
Bed016_964	Yeah , that 's good . ; u ; But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . ; Ellipsis .
Bmr019_149	Um . So . Um . ; And we know ; Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ? ; No .
Bed014_302	that she 's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August ; and then we 'll figure out a way for you uh you to get seriously connected with , um their group . ; So ; that 's , uh looks pretty good .
Bmr027_1063	Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . ; That 's the next example , ; the next one . ; The , uh , version beyond this is
Bsr001_1692	Hmm , hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah , so you so you ; Why why is that ?
Bmr025_967	Maybe we could do like a student project , ; and ; you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_304	Because it 's Again , it 's , ; um ; So you were doing like ; So each meeting each meetings takes , uh , something like
Bro016_629	Hmm . ; Could be expensive . ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bed006_1118	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; You have a further specific intentions to left to lift your right foot ; Hmm ?
Bed006_439	and then take the test away the the the the the text away ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote ,
Bmr006_628	Is that the one that has is that DC ? ; So . ; Yep . ; No , no ,
Bmr008_946	Oh , OK . ; I was just saying , looking at applications of people over the years for post - docs here . ; They 're r generally not very good at assessing their own abilities . ; Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it .
Bmr024_337	Right , Morgan ? ; Um ; Is that what you 're ? ; Yeah , I 'm I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about .
Bed005_476	Oh , this is German . ; Sorry . ; e ; So , now , this , it cannot do anymore .
Bmr002_284	So , I 'm just curious how how h how exactly you got roped into this . ; I mean ; Oh . ; Um , because my name was was mentioned when I wasn't around ,
Bsr001_665	Yeah . ; which is non - trivial . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_578	Well maybe we can ; It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_149	And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . ; So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more . ; Right . ; But uh the back - end was pretty smooth .
Bro028_871	Hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . And they do they said that they could do it for the test ; So you don't have to change the training .
Bro023_1374	Oh yes . ; Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative ; because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something . ; s
Bmr011_1599	It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of ; I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , ; aren't they ? ; I mean , I sort of feel like they have
Buw001_678	L ; Liz , you ; Just to archive . ; u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh , subcommittee meeting or whatever
Bmr030_657	Mmm . ; So . ; Hmm ! ; I think it only saves , like , half .
Bed011_1105	you know , that 's definitely gonna be uh , a major one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , yeah .
Btr001_1815	It 's it depends on the person , ; I mean , some people don't tend to do aren't that involved in the meeting , or something , ; and they don't tend to say as much , ; Mmm .
Bro016_820	And those ; OK . ; And tho that 's what goes into HTK ? ; Uh , almost .
Bro021_176	mmm , ; as a first experiment , I think I ; Yeah . ; Well , what I did is t is to take , um to measure the average
Bro028_292	but still , uh , what happens is is that , uh , the digit error rate on this is around one percent , ; Yeah . ; while our system is currently at seven percent . ; Um , but what happens also is that if I listen to the , um a re - synthesized version of the speech
Bmr024_1202	So . ; Well , let 's just say that men are simple . ; So so , when So I I had I ha ; That was a quick response .
Bmr001_448	If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bmr018_825	and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . ; So , um , if we d ; it might be possible to take Thilo 's output ; and like if you have , um , like right now these meetings are all ,
Bro003_1541	are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ? ; I 'm I 've been kind of out of it . ; Yeah , ; I think , yeah .
Bmr022_502	Which means , you know , even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take You know , nearly all the time , ; there would be no ; Yeah . ; W if it 's a hundred , then you know , that 's not the issue ,
Bns002_783	I mean , it will be a start with another RTS CTS . ; Oh , ; so ! ; OK ,
Bmr029_762	So so , um when you You did some TI - digits t t experiments training on Macrophone . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; But that 's not necessarily any less data than the SRI Hub - five
Bmr008_537	Very just a limited number ; OK . ; and then if you 're American you would just circle the region where ; Yeah .
Bmr015_153	Wow . ; Yep . ; Yep . ; Which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set .
Btr001_1694	or like inbreaths , ; like as though you 're gonna start speaking , ; Yeah , ; you 're about to s speak .
Bmr002_268	I I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms in . ; Oh , right , right , right . ; Anyway . So , why did I call you all here ? ; Yes .
Bed011_985	And um the ; see this this this uh ontology node is probably something that I will try to expand . ; Once we have the full ontology API , what can we expect to get from the ontology ? ; And hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the
Btr002_2117	Cuz I also tend ; Like , we were talking about " so " . ; I do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_834	That was that was exactly the notion that that that we discussed . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Thanks .
Bed015_249	there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um to talk about there also being a designated object ; and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? ; So the ball is the head of the phrase , ; " the r the " , um , " big red ball " ,
Bro005_1133	Um If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them . ; And put put them together . ; What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean ; I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones .
Bed002_98	Right . ; Um , but uh , ; um , it w uh , ; I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .
Bmr006_1082	And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe . ; Uh , and uh on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well , uh the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_41	so I thought we could do , uh ; I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too . ; But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_114	Mm - hmm . ; and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that . ; I see . ; I don't think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads ,
Bro011_274	It 's good to delegate . ; I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk ; and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . ; Great .
Bmr011_679	Right , so we have we ; Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , ; that you have an infrastructure problem , ; you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped ,
Bed003_794	What ? ; The size of the landmark . ; Um . Not when we were doing this , ; Cuz if it 's
Bmr031_512	Yeah . ; As long as they have only , like , three people per meeting . ; They 'll just pounce . ; How many channels ?
Bmr019_1906	OK . ; Mmm . ; Simultaneous one ? ; OK .
Bro015_164	OK . ; Uh , disk crash and uh covering things . ; u ; OK .
Bro022_540	Yeah . ; They have speaker adaptation . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed014_834	but um ; I haven't . OK . ; not ; It it might even be interesting then to say that I should be forced to um , sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the , uh out of the top hat
Bed002_432	So if someone says something you could ask them . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And Now , one thing you could do is always ask them ,
Bsr001_1448	Even if we don't make any decisions we 'll have a lot of data . ; That 's right . ; But it will be all documented . ; Sorry .
Bsr001_703	Yeah . ; I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand .
Bmr029_594	I mean , it ; it , uh might might not work out . ; But , uh , f figured I may as well ask for it . ; OK .
Bns003_764	You have to to provide a certain a certain prime for the subject too , ; O ; Of course . ; but , you know , sometimes , especially in the in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open
Bmr006_1516	Right . ; So that 's gonna stay that person 's name . ; Yep . ; Now , in terms of like the transcript ,
Bns001_345	uh ; What about the user who is switching from one let 's say zero - cost area network to another network where he has to pay . ; It is OK for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another . ; But probably , the user wants to be aware that he 's switching from one place from one network to another .
Bmr016_1871	You need a lot of ; What I meant was " beep " . ; You need a lot of qualification Adam . ; That 's been changed .
Bmr015_204	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , if there 's space , though , between them . ; I mean , you can
Bns001_677	or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1091	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean I can only think of like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while . ; Hmm .
Bmr029_969	Or are you is there another interface that you use ? ; For w for Festival ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , you can just use it from the
Bed008_349	yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; But that 's - that seems to ,
Bro016_938	OK . ; Right . ; So . ; How are , uh , uh how are things going with what you 're doing ?
Bmr019_1111	Good . ; They do ? ; Oh . ; Yes .
Bro024_429	And uh , should I should I explain , uh , more about what what I 'm proposing to do , and s and stuff ? ; Yes , briefly . ; Yeah briefly . ; OK .
Bro014_73	Right . ; That 's right . ; I remember now . ; And so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh for all of the the digit words , you end up with , uh , three mixtures per state ,
Bed008_263	climb , emerge ; No no no , ; Uh ; Well some of those are subsumed by approach .
Bro027_1501	as soon as I finish this other thing . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2369	That people do that one a lot . ; And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly . ; And after a while , I started getting confused as to whether or not he was , like , just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself , ; or whether he was meaning it in conversat
Bed008_761	Viewing usually is cheap or free . ; Is that always true ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know .
Btr001_1473	Mm - hmm . ; and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing . ; Yeah . ; Because i it 's just i n
Bed013_1122	What is the uh ; Well ; And then given that we know that the construction has these two things , we can set up probabilities ; we can s basically define all the tables for ev for those
Bro026_955	You know , however we do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , ; because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that .
Bmr016_663	And also I just wanted to mention briefly that , um , uh Andreas and I called up Dan Ellis who 's still stuck in Switzerland , ; and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . ; Not that we were gonna do it , ; but we wanted to know what would need to be done .
Bro017_614	So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w ; Mm - hmm . ; driving in the car with Morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1280	Oh , no ? ; Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , ; or ? ; Uh , yeah ,
Bdb001_341	Yeah , so there is something like that ; but it 's , um , probably not as sophist ; And I think there 's ; Well , what does H T K do for features ?
Bns002_1584	Um . You always have the SGSN and UMTS , ; they are called three - GSGSN . ; And you have the protocol stack ; um in on the slide number five , to see what uh is going on .
Bro014_792	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; and then two neura two neural networks . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1065	Um , ; now we have this um , meeting data . ; You know , like the stuff we 're recording right now , ; Yeah .
Bed003_141	Like you m might be able to " Vista " it , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And be able to
Bmr009_1576	And it 's also also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing is proposed to the ; Hmm ? ; So I I don't think it 'll be bad . ; So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people ,
Bmr016_981	and it 's embedded in the file name . ; And so , you know , you just say ; We - yeah that 's so that 's part of it ; y so you just say you know " asterisk E asterisk dot wave " , and you get what you want .
Bro027_978	That gives you this . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know what it does in combination . ; You don't necessarily know what
Bmr022_1408	But I could be wrong . ; Probably not transcripts , ; but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files . ; And they 're certainly gonna wanna change tools .
Bmr023_1214	Yeah . I , uh , th ; what I don't remember is which came out best . ; So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT , ; and another one , since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs
Bed013_1252	and g a and t make conclusions about the user 's intelligence . ; OK . So in some ways ; I don't know , ; yeah .
Bmr019_1419	I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round , ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's very specific . ; uh w in ninety - nine
Bro012_61	I mean I think there 's some effect above twenty ; but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild . ; So , I mean it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild . ; I don't know in the in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the
Bmr003_1684	can't it also ? ; Yes . ; But their but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , then i they a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1485	but wouldn't say exactly when it happened . ; I 'll be right back . ; I transcribed a minute of this stuff ; I see .
Bsr001_2432	Yeah , ; that 's right , ; TIMIT . ; So we actually talked about that .
Bro028_825	You have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever . ; And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . ; Hmm . ; You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation .
Bmr013_479	Yeah . ; Right . ; Well I think what I mean I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , uh , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . ; But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment .
Bmr014_182	OK . ; I see . ; along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1159	So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , but but what I 'm thinking is that in the EDU meetings , they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers . ; And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . ; It seems to me that um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , ; but then there 's this question of the time @ @ uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be uh y y y
Bmr026_971	And the dictionary made a huge difference . ; Uh . Yeah . ; Uh . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh to the dictionary about two years ago ; which resulted in a uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard ,
Btr002_1370	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then there was some conversation in addition , that that , um , needed to be transcribed . ; Mmm .
Bmr024_38	Reorganization status . ; Oh . ; Files and directories ? ; Files and directories .
Btr002_2649	transcribed ? ; and then two dots , ; like the next bin will be empty , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1315	and ; It could be that our recognizer 's actually doing relatively well ; because it has a reject model for , you know , mismatched speech , essentially , ; or for unspecified speech .
Bro004_1265	I don't know . ; Hmm . ; But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_861	but it might be a useful , neat part of the project ; that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time ; that happen that you just wanna make a note of , ; like what Jane was talking about
Bmr010_1345	not only , eh , nonspeech and speech , but , eh , in in in the speech class , ; Mm - hmm . ; dividing , eh , speech , eh , of from a speaker and overlapping , ; to try to to do , eh , eh , a fast a fast , eh , experiment to to prove that , nnn , this fea eh , general feature , eh , can solve the the the problem ,
Bro023_1055	Yeah . ; Right . ; On Italian . ; But on Finnish it 's a little bit worse , apparently .
Bed016_768	Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of there 's resource , ; Yeah . ; right , ; and like , what is film ,
Btr002_1349	Actually , you you also did a different type of transcription i uh , with res respect to , um , our sister project , ; the SmartKom project , ; which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through Germany , ; Oh , right .
Bro013_492	Yeah . ; So w which is clean and which is noise ? ; I think the lower one is noise . ; The lower is noise and the height is clean .
Bed011_967	Same ; OK , that . ; Got it . ; Like what What have I got now ?
Bsr001_2355	And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them ; so please pause between ; but it 's very people don't like doing that . ; And so there is this prosodic thing which is which is indicating when whe the pauses between these digit strings .
Bmr025_797	I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally ; and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads ; and so that means synchronizing the time ; You know you want it pretty close
Bed008_665	" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome or do I just have to " " time to take a picture of the outside ? " ; Right . ; It seems like everything in a user model a affects ; Well that 's what we don't wanna do ,
Bmr001_192	I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy . ; Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway . ; Are we ? ; Sure .
Bns003_352	I ; I don't know . ; I will take a look and I will tell you something . ; Yeah ,
Bed002_311	And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data ; That was the wrong one . ; um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . ; First of all ,
Bmr003_1264	Yeah . ; Yeah , I see . ; That 's a ; OK .
Bro004_319	and going to a different language um ; It doesn't seem to matter ; The difference between three and four is not particularly great , ; so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal .
Bmr022_686	or ; So , just ; I mean , you 've already broken them into chunks , ; so if you have if you have a th if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred , or or you know .
Bmr020_465	And then we looked at locations where , ; uh , ; if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , you know , where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really , but you know , sentences , ; Ah .
Bro012_702	because you 're you 're you 're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out ; you know , you you look at the good one , you look at the cru the screwed up one , and and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @ ; I noticed that in the pictures . ; yeah .
Bro027_1570	After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . ; So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . ; And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . ; So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands ,
Bmr003_1019	So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour . ; Of of tape ? ; Or of action ? ; Thirty
Bed006_640	Mm - hmm . ; unless we get some some topical German movies that have just come out and that are in their database . ; Right . ; So the person may select " Huehner Rennen " or whatever .
Bed006_437	but but uh i uh uh i you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture ; and also uh I think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task ; and then take the test away the the the the the text away ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1848	Oh yeah , I had that one . ; Yeah ! Y yeah ! ; Oh yeah . ; Yes . Oh , yes .
Bro003_1185	I I think it 's - it 's - it 's not so long ; because , well , the TI - digits test data is about , uh how many hours ? ; Uh , th uh , thirty hours of speech , I think , ; It 's a few hours .
Bed011_1027	I have to do uh uh unbounded dependencies , ; you know , which have a variety of constructions in uh uh ; instantiate that . ; On the other hand I have to have , you know ,
Bmr024_468	What was the other problem ? ; Oh ! ; That Thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_216	I mean ; Boy ! ; Clearly I mean , my impression is i if I have to wear this thing , you know , more than five minutes , uh , uh , uh , I mean , I I will be completely affected by it somehow . ; Huh .
Bro026_658	I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . ; Mmm . ; So it 's it 's a double check . ; So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight .
Bro027_1576	Uh , ; the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can ; Mm - hmm . ; g And it gave me like , uh , one point One more than one percent relative improvement .
Bmr026_871	That 's e ; Yeah that was the interesting thing . ; That was e ; Because because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better ,
Bmr003_491	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Well they 're ; this is clever .
Bmr022_215	You could have , um , each speaker in the meeting say " beep " and record it ; and that will be their pro ; No , I just thi I don't know . If you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one , ; Sorry .
Bmr008_332	I mean a lot of corpora ; Uh , sure . But if someone doesn't want to write it down I don't want them to say you can't record me ; yeah , so we ca we have these age ranges or something ? ; Oh , right .
Bmr024_977	because the C Ds are so slow . ; See ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr016_376	and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . ; So . ; The only thing that we don't have , ; Great .
Bro026_656	Mmm . ; And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . ; I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . ; Mmm .
Bmr031_160	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's not quite not quite fifty percent ; but really getting close .
Btr001_450	and uh , ; And ; um ; isn't it Catalan ?
Bmr008_1410	But ; even if you make a mistake occasionally , that that i is roughly i is there some corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if if uh if you ; right ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1747	but I I think the rest is cross - talk . ; That that may be true . ; But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods ; Yeah .
Bro005_493	you know , ; d Was that experiment done ? ; No , not yet . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro026_657	And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . ; I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . ; Mmm . ; So it 's it 's a double check .
Bro019_898	So . ; So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine ; s some something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage , ; Yeah .
Bed009_300	cuz we wanna not Pa - pass over any you know , questions or concerns that you have . ; Well there 're there 're two levels of of giving an answer and I guess on both levels I don't have any um further questions . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_2587	right . ; And then we could ; Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what 's based on these ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1897	Yeah . I may I may hold off . ; But if I was eh , but maybe I 'll get some later . ; Mmm . ; Thanks .
Bro005_907	But it seems impor important to use the delta . ; Uh , with respect to the network size , ; there 's one experiment that 's still running ; and we should have the result today ,
Bro003_504	Mmm . ; Ah , but which Dan ? ; Uh , Ellis . ; OK .
Bed011_991	not the discourse , the utterance as it were , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; in terms of uh
Bmr029_982	Oh , that 's neat . ; OK ? ; Digits ? ; Ah . OK .
Bed002_210	I guess these g have got better filters . ; Cuz I sent it to everybody . ; You just blew it off . ; Ah .
Bmr031_1111	I don't know ; what type of utterance , ; whether it 's a question or a statement or whatever . ; And then you have an , uh you know , an a tag attribute
Bed016_1160	you know you know , where r ; Yeah . ; What color was this in in in the nain nineteenth century . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1323	Yeah . ; More classes . ; Yeah . ; That 's what I mean .
Bmr025_421	Just marks ? ; So it 's implicit in in there ; but you have to do a lot of processing to get it . ; Yeah .
Bro017_663	And . But so they may be a way to to fiddle with the f with the f ; Insertions . ; Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_724	um how do we do this ? ; What do I have under user state anyhow ; cuz I named that already something . ; Oh that 's tired , fresh ,
Btr002_1167	Yeah , it doesn't really matter . ; Same here ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_566	And so . ; Yeah . ; We are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction ; but of of our own , I mean , another spectral substraction .
Bro021_377	You mean the ; I ; The whatever you , uh , tested with recently . Right ? ; Mmm ?
Btr001_1899	Or something , ; I went on I actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago . ; so . ; Neat .
Bed016_726	Yeah , I I believe all that , ; it 's just ; right ? ; " he 's on the standing on the bus waving to me . "
Bro010_968	or if he did he didn't talk about it . ; It 's it 's just ; And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um , the , uh , ; uh he he did a comparison to , uh , you know , our old foil ,
Bmr026_190	And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . ; So hopefully that will work . ; Really ? ; So is that
Bmr026_382	mmm . ; How much space do you need for these ? ; I don't know . ; I don't know what his schedule is .
Bmr028_1014	So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location . ; Speaker ID . ; Yeah . ; Well , there 're different ways of thinking about it .
Bmr008_178	But but you want to have that information . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; So , if you don't have that information , how are you gonna do anything ?
Bmr018_277	so , I mean , the question is " should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? " ; And I th eh so far as I 'm concerned it 's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point , ; and ; That 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to .
Bro019_1193	And ; Uh , is it with TI - digits , or with ? ; No , I work with eh , Italian and Spanish basically . ; OK .
Bmr001_822	or do you point , ; or I don't know . ; There 's supposed to be some out out out - of - work shepherders or something in Scotland but ; Yeah .
Bro010_738	But it 's it 's i i i ; using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech
Bsr001_1368	That 'd be cool actually . ; Yeah . ; I mean , that 's the question . ; If if we are collecting these at different sites , different kinds of tasks , different people , what is there that 's gonna be uniform about this collection ?
Bmr021_971	I actually have one more thing that ; I don't know if it 's i if if it 's allowed to to bring up after the dis ; After digits , ; I don't know .
Bed006_1062	See that that bothers me that they 're the same thing . ; No , no , just the ; Yeah ? ; Yeah
Bed006_953	So it 's g it 's the spec is there ; and it 's gonna part of the M - three - L AP API filed by the end of this year ; so that this means we can start using it basically now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1077	But they have coded zero delay for that . ; Because they ch I know they changed it , ; their compression . ; They have their own CRC ,
Bed015_1224	So , ; uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . ; So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_72	No I 'm just ; I mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . ; And if they are , then they can't be used . ; Right .
Bmr029_774	There wa it is a subse ; Yeah . ; No . Only the portion that was in the Hub - five training set . ; Oh . OK .
Bed016_292	What is the s ? ; Oh ! ; OK . And so forth and so forth . ; Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing ,
Bed002_358	if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . ; Which I think we maybe want to ignore . ; But . That 's my idea . ; It 's up for discussion .
Bmr006_1107	Eh , why ? ; Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . ; Right . ; PDA speech file is eh it will be eh difficult .
Bmr021_299	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , so ; I know that the files that you 've been cutting up for us f for the recognition experiments ,
Bro019_1140	Mm - hmm . ; and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si uh , spectrum of the signal ; and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank . ; I 'm so sorry .
Bmr014_1008	Fair enough . ; so . ; Yeah . ; Sh - sh
Bmr021_106	Right . ; I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it ; and still not reasonable , ; yeah .
Bro026_400	So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot .
Bed015_1918	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and and all that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_400	There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away . ; And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in . ; So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , ; and see does that is that does that make the difference ?
Bmr031_1610	But that 's th that 's the first thing to do . ; maybe this will work , ; I don't know . ; And then you know , then the next thing is , " well , let 's just look at the voiced regions " ,
Bmr023_858	So ; Right . ; Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . ; So and and
Bns001_823	Well the ; And ; So " network applications " , if you look at the name of the group , one thing is that um the they used to call a a n a " network " that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network . ; If you look at " network " from the OZ layer , then it 's uh , level two or something or maybe level three , but everything below three .
Bmr011_1225	Yeah . ; Well , yeah , ; but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1263	Mm - hmm . ; But typically a person has to , uh , mediate you know , which changes actually get go through . ; So ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1194	so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , um , you know , comma and things like that , ; and we kept the and disfluency dashes uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr013_292	Right . ; and it really , ; I actually think that data should be used more . ; That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence .
Bmr028_1008	S does the clustering ? Do you give it sort of a target number of clusters ? Or is it ? adapted in some way ? ; Um , you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use as a threshold . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants .
Bro011_686	But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things ; Yeah . ; how much better can you make it ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_506	Because it would be different depending on what your language is . ; So ; Do you mean state , or do you mean more broad than the state level ? ; Hmm .
Bed014_639	Renew ; re re essentially re - initiali you know , re - i essentially re - initialize the state . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed009_290	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So if if this is additional information that could be merged in by them . ; And then it would be available to action planning and and others .
Bmr003_643	Well th there is als ; Yeah , really . ; There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , you can you could get people to to um , to do it in exchange . ; Well , i b but seriously , I I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this
Bro018_910	Yeah , I don't think it 's in there , ; I think it 's in the uh uh uh the filters . ; So , the F F T is on everything , ; but the filters
Bed003_265	There we go . ; But uh ; So . The mode basically has three different outputs . ; The probability whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter .
Bed015_1488	Right , so the constructions might of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; In which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . ; But when you actually say that " he walked into " , whatever , um , the " he " will refer to a particular
Bmr008_934	Proficiency . ; That 's a good idea . ; Uh , I ; That 's hard though , for self - identification
Bmr002_159	Should we start it over ? ; No . ; OK . ; Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now ,
Bmr016_1751	Huh . ; Right . ; But at some point I mean , we probably shoul ; We 'll probably add it to the language model .
Bro017_320	I mean the so the minimum is one . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ? ; So we somehow made arbitrary decision , " yes " .
Bmr019_1540	But , um , clearly when we actually get here we 'll move things around this , as we need to , ; but ; OK . ; so you can't absolutely count on it .
Bmr001_433	OK , that is a bit more than I thought . ; How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space ; cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory . ; Yeah .
Bro022_6	Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; We were two
Bmr002_286	Oh . ; Um , because my name was was mentioned when I wasn't around , ; but I 'm most happy . ; OK .
Bmr019_1490	You know , that 's that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation stuff . ; Yeah . ; I will send you the the final version , ; Yeah .
Bmr026_883	I could also put in uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2967	they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say . ; I mean , you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed004_503	It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once . ; Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways . ; Mm - hmm . ; Good .
Bmr009_339	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of of people that can overlap . ; Yeah .
Bed003_334	" What is the admission fee ? " . ; So that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to Enter the place rather than uh to Tango or Vista , ; Uh - huh . ; Right .
Bmr011_193	Right . ; but @ @ but uh , ; sounds sounds fine . ; Sounds like uniformity wins .
Btr001_661	but . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened .
Bdb001_437	And I actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose . ; Yeah . ; So maybe it 's maybe oth you know , ; if if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't .
Bro019_480	But but ; so ; so that is when uh , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . ; And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now .
Bmr015_1051	because the people will want it in there . ; OK , so maybe the question is notating it . ; Yeah . If it gets ; Yeah ?
Bmr006_887	Yeah . ; It 's just sort of that the the background acoustic ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed016_279	Mm - hmm . ; Sounds like Fey . ; Yeah . ; But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer ,
Bmr024_653	And then ; Now th ; Yeah . ; So we save it because it 's it it 's potentially useful .
Bed013_1135	Right ? ; So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question . ; So what what would the outcome of of your parser look like ? ; And , what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get , squeeze out of that utterance ?
Bmr003_1463	Yeah . ; and if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " , ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Btr001_2022	and you 're like , " Oh , no , ; Right . ; something something 's going on that I don't know . " ; Yeah , they 're referring to this or that and the other thing
Bmr026_371	Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . ; What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? ; Yep . ; I see Oh , I see .
Bro014_795	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm , ; and it doesn't seem to help . ; Um , however , we just have one result ,
Bed015_57	And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . ; There there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . ; But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . ; I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .
Bmr015_906	doesn't work . ; And I don't know ; why . ; But the instantaneous frequency ,
Bed014_343	or my beliefs and your beliefs , ; or any of these other ones of of multiple models . ; So um ; you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those
Bmr020_541	but it is sort of interesting from ; It 's nice to actually measure it though . ; Yeah . ; I wonder about the cause and effect there .
Bmr011_541	That 's right , I mean if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , ; Right . ; I mean , we don't care . ; That would be fine ,
Bmr015_368	Yeah . ; Or something like that , ; Well we 'll have to see what the numbers are . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1134	It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , ; Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos . ; But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted ; so that it 's decision about what the right you know , right right uh delays are is , uh is right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect .
Bmr019_530	I don't know how different they are from each other . ; You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker . ; To be best ; For this particular digit ones , I just picked that one .
Bns001_920	Because Multicast you still mentio uh you mentioned that there is no potential . ; I think it 's described here that the potential , if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map Multicast ; because they do not use it . ; And to figure out whether they 're useful inse instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels
Bro021_856	when we have a , um , a statistic of the clean speech and an statistic of the noisy speech . ; And the clean speech the statistic of the clean speech is from a codebook . ; Mmm ? This is the idea . ; Well , like , this relation is not linear .
Bmr026_127	So you want people to be able to listen to them . ; So , um the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? ; Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and ; Oh , that 's a good point .
Bro011_412	Oh OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_906	and it was a Meeting Recorder meeting . ; Um . ; But , yeah , we should try to use what you have . ; I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one .
Bmr013_422	That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? ; Yeah . ; I thought ; Yeah , so I mean , what , what where this is , I mean , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind ,
Bed009_767	Mm - hmm . ; so it 's speed is crucial . ; uh ; And they are not fast enough .
Bmr016_1099	So three on this side , ; three on this side . ; And I stapled them . ; OK .
Bro007_93	Mmm yeah , yeah . ; then we could compare the two and say what was better . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1715	which is , ; yeah , It 's fine ; so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say " well if you really look at it , you just need our RAD . " ; You can throw the rest away ,
Buw001_2128	I 'm not . ; u e e ; I think you are . ; We haven't sent anything to the list yet .
Bmr031_117	Channel B . ; I 'll Let me raise the gain on that a little bit ; OK . ; Channel B .
Bro021_570	because he feels that the SmartKom system interaction is not gonna be exactly conversational . ; Mm - hmm . ; S so actually I was wondering , how long does it take to train that Broadcast News net ? ; The big one takes a while .
Bmr024_1554	A few more processors ? ; How many are you shooting for ? ; There 're five now . ; It can hold eight .
Bro010_1126	OK . ; So . ; Yeah , I think it 's an interesting interesting way to go . ; Cool .
Bro003_289	Yes . ; To fill in the cube . ; To fill i fill it in , ; yeah .
Buw001_565	Never . ; and ; Never . I 've never seen it at ICSI . ; Does anyone ?
Bmr024_1072	OK . ; Yeah . ; Good . ; It 's good .
Bro018_1077	Trying to track it down . ; Yeah . ; I guess this was a little bit off topic , I guess , ; Yeah
Bro023_499	I 'm actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum ; which they 're not doing . ; They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter , ; Yeah .
Bmr023_320	Right now they 're in the process of being edited . ; Um , the , um ; Let 's see , ; I hired two transcribers today . I 'm thinking of hiring another one ,
Bed005_1486	So , I will , e e before next week , uh , @ @ p push push some more on on this stuff that Dekai Wu did , ; and try to understand it . ; Uh , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give to people ? ; p Sure .
Bmr005_945	I wanted to get a feel for that ; to sort of be able to know what what can be done first ; and like how many meetings are we recording ; Right so there 's this this There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .
Bmr010_135	Jose . ; Adam , Dave , and I , we did , ; for that dialogue ; and I trained it on that .
Btr001_2443	you know , you can stop laughing now " . ; Right . ; That 's possible . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_476	I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something , ; Mm - hmm . ; but if if , uh if we 're getting thirty - five , forty percent or something , u um ; Actually if you run , though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error .
Bro014_1146	and that 's that should be flat for ; Yeah . ; I see . ; So do you have a picture that sh ?
Bmr015_897	eh , was ; th it was very interesting . ; Because I I saw eh , how the spectrum concentrate , eh , ; Oh !
Bed010_155	You should probably move the microphone closer to your face . ; Mm - hmm . ; But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts ; There 's like a little The twisty thing , you can move it with .
Bed015_1731	Yeah , it 's an it 's an evidential . ; It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . ; People have talked about it this way . ; And you know , you can do sort of special things .
Bro003_1263	Yeah . ; So this is ; Yeah , I mean , ; I kind of like this because what it
Bro013_51	That 's true . ; And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr020_107	and they said yes . ; And then she said " Did I say three ? ; I meant four . " ; Oh ,
Bro019_144	So . ; So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , ; Yeah . ; is the rough division of
Bns003_587	Yes , ; but you have no ; but I won't go back to the university ; yeah ?
Bed013_834	The th ; So . ; The SUDO - square is , " Situation " , " User " , " Discourse " , right ? " Ontology " . ; Oh I saw the diagram in the office ,
Bmr003_1514	Yeah . ; That 's true . ; Right . ; Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " .
Bmr013_919	uh , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that doesn't the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either . ; I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient
Bmr003_2423	I do ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; If if we bought you the thing would you mind using it with i the the
Bmr014_138	Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . ; Um . And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . ; And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . ; Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is well , a couple things .
Bmr003_2180	Right . ; N none of these and no P Z Ms then . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bns003_261	The pages are already on the web ? ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yes ,
Bns002_467	You have checked that the that this frame has received uh without errors . ; Naja to to ; Yeah . ; OK ?
Bmr028_368	I just figured you p ; There 's a link there that now says if you want to search by filter by a regular expression , you can . ; Oh , my gosh . ; OK .
Bmr018_882	Yes . ; And so i and may you know , I mean , it 's ; I think that there always th there would have to be some hand - tweaking , ; but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things .
Bro019_160	that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . ; Um , I have I have a question about the uh , parallelization ? ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1208	But ; Yeah , so I don't know . ; Yeah , but I li ; But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we
Bmr018_1157	It 's one of the NSA 's . ; I sent email before the conference , before last week . ; Oh , OK . ; That might might have been the one one of the ones that we did .
Bmr021_735	So the f the bandwidth of the um SRI front - end is from hundreds hertz to th th thirty - se ; Thirty - seven fifty . ; thirty - seven fifty or something like that . ; And I do not know what the um ICSI um front - end would do .
Bsr001_1704	You mean , you ne ; The microphones are different ? ; You mean , uh , bu to combining the the posteriors on full band recognition like from from three different or four different mikes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_362	and I was gonna test to see which front - end I 'd I wanted to use , ; I would try to weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in . ; If I ; But but No .
Btr002_2406	So it 's sort of like , " Wait a minute , I 'm thinking . " ; Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's not lexicalized .
Bmr008_655	There we probably have to have a category " Non - American English " and then a few choices . ; And we should have something that 's simple , that people can circle , like these TIMIT regions or something , so that we have something that minimally you can ; cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use . ; They 're gonna want some small set of places ,
Bmr003_762	But then , you know , it 's like , uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . ; But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key ; Yeah . ; so it 's slightly delayed ,
Bmr023_84	No . That was all , um , previously here . ; Oh . ; I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them , ; Oh ,
Bmr003_630	So . ; There 's a reason why he 's resisted . ; But . ; Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription .
Bmr027_50	So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies ; and , uh , ; so far no one has made any Ach ! any comments on them . ; So , no on no one has bleeped out anything .
Bed013_768	Yeah , I guess four pages you could ; I mean you could definitely it 's definitely possible to do it . ; It 's just It 'd just be small . ; Like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail ,
Bmr002_722	When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM , ; but if we 're rather than rather than designing our own format , we 'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think . ; Yeah , I guess that 's true . ; Yeah .
Bro004_589	Do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the Aurora ? ; And ; Mmm , no . ; No .
Bed016_829	There was ? ; Well , there I thought or there was a paper on it . ; Who ? ; Out .
Bmr007_1178	Uh , audio pix wh he did it , ; so why don't you explain it quickly ? ; It 's just , uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting ; so , you know you can say things like , " Well , this should probably not be on the record , but beep "
Bsr001_367	apical - alveolar kind of thing . ; Yeah . ; I don't know . ; Right ,
Bro019_1090	yeah . ; yeah . ; Now there are some adaptation though , ; OK .
Bmr009_432	And ; But I guess I was just saying that that right now uh from the means that you gave , I don't have any sense of whether even , you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct ; and I would imagine there should be some you know , there should be The distributions should be somewhat separated . ; Yeah .
Bro023_367	it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it . ; No , what 's what 's the number ? ; Uh , so I I don't have that number here . ; OK , OK , OK ,
Bmr031_480	because it 's it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . ; That 's like three times three times as much disk space . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . It 's four or five times .
Bro019_917	So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise . ; So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , ; first of the colo colored noise ; Yeah .
Bro021_439	but without , uh , compensation it was like fifteen was s slightly better than thirteen , ; Yeah . ; so that 's why we stuck to thirteen . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1490	but but , uh , ; I mean , the missing thi ; so so what they were saying it 's one of these things is you know , all you need is more data , sort of ; But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , uh , improperly ,
Bmr018_584	Yeah . ; Did you run the Andreas the r SRI recognizer on the digits ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , I thought he had sent that around to everyone ,
Bmr018_1101	Yeah . ; Especially the batteried meter popping up , ; that was hilarious . ; Yeah .
Bro010_991	Uh , and so in that sense it was an unfair test . ; Um , ; so I think that the questioner was right . ; It it was in that sense an unfair test .
Bsr001_1944	So , ; yeah , that 's that 's the way we 've been approaching it . ; Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do do that anyway . ; Eh if we if we 're ge
Bns001_692	Ah , delay is also considered in these networks . ; So , ; uh , in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter , and a a a specified um data speed . ; So you can scale up scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels .
Bro024_413	Then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all . ; Oh . ; And then your second pass , uh , uh , eliminates those most of those hypotheses by , uh by having an improved improved version o of the analysis . ; OK .
Buw001_1221	How to do this ; I , uh ; Yeah . ; from the summary .
Btr002_1467	Um , it 's not on the resolution part . ; It 's where you have it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting . ; So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along . ; Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line .
Bmr012_1313	number two would be sort of a the the transcription process ; so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the the multitrans interface ; which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments ; which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing
Bro005_45	Summary of experiments since , well , since last week ; and also since the we 've started to run work on this . ; Um . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization ; but with delta also ,
Bns002_1091	Of course , there are also some some solutions ; like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source route routing , ; so you don't have to put all the all the route ; This one , for instance .
Bro004_711	yeah . ; OK . ; So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down ; but perhaps not not so much
Bmr005_1192	So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours . ; I mean , is there Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci ; I mean , that are less ; well I don't
Bro024_532	uh , ; ps the fifty - six percent is like comparable to what the French Telecom gets , ; but the thirty - five percent is way off . ; I 'm sort of confused
Bed005_663	Yeah , yeah . ; This is this is everything that that , um , you know , um we might want to do in the next couple years . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So what would
Btr002_894	Oh . y ; and then " shift " ; and then " shift " ; " shift " , what is it ?
Btr002_2672	Oh , well , yeah , that 's that 's a different thing . ; That 's right . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . OK .
Bmr025_1047	Right , so ; Well OK , so let 's do one of those simultaneous ones . ; so we might n we might need to do that actually . ; OK .
Bmr029_456	We want to i incorporate certain data that would not be available during final tests , uh , under a a full fair test of it , much as we are in the all the numbers that we have so far . ; OK . So we assume we assume knowledge of the speakers as as , um in a way that 's compatible with the close - talking test set . ; Oops . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1615	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Same things happens with pronouns . ; There 's languages where , um ,
Bed006_359	OK . ; Because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , or as much as they can , of that phrasing . ; Hmm . ; Um , are you worried about being able to identify
Bmr028_406	So . ; It 's hard to find . ; That makes it g ; That 's a compliment to you .
Bro003_1232	I I think the neural net SPERT . ; Y you did a you did it on a SPERT board . ; OK , ; Yes .
Bed009_968	Set . ; Maybe yeah . ; Some extensions uh have to be made . For for a English version ; Mmm .
Btr002_1321	You 'd have to find where the digits were . ; Oh . ; And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere , ; Oh wow .
Bmr027_1484	when he can get these ; You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous ; and that caused a lot of problems ; Mmm .
Bed003_439	Or un unknown , ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; OK .
Bmr018_644	What we 're calling . ; Oh . ; Hmm ! ; which which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for for it .
Buw001_790	Mm - hmm . ; And they had ; they just turn on these cameras . ; They were they were not moving or anything .
Bed010_997	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I may have to go to Switzerland for in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that . ; OK ,
Bmr018_123	Eurospeech is due on Friday ; and then I 'm going down to San uh , San Jose Friday night , ; so , if you know , if we start nice and late Saturday that 's a good thing . ; No , I mean , they 're flying up from from
Btr001_700	Yeah . ; Sometimes the beginning the person started to say something , ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bmr006_1836	I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like " Mister White " , " Mister Pink " , " Mister Blue " . ; Mister White . ; Yeah . ; Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ?
Bmr005_1110	and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike . ; When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone ; and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . ; Yeah .
Bns001_700	but from the point of view of the mobile things uh I 'm not sure if if ; It 's packaged data oriented . ; It 's not really circuit - switched . ; In UMTS you have always GPS as a a involvement in the core network .
Bed017_145	and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , ; um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . ; And so ; this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .
Bmr022_899	The k kind that guys that like to look like they 're really cool at airports wear . ; or the ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_101	I I run down the street , ; it 's typed , uh , " I " , ; meaning category is what 's there . ; The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair
Bed015_1295	Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , " source , path , goal " has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or whate whatever . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1217	So UW records a meeting , ; we transcribe it . ; Yeah . ; A few months later they listen to it
Bmr023_385	f for just very few days you were away . ; Yeah . ; But it happened to be during that time I needed one , ; so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours
Bmr018_801	Actually y we can tell from the data that we have , ; From the insertions , maybe ? ; fr fr from the ; um , yeah , there 's a way to tell .
Bmr009_1486	Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels . ; Thank you ! ; It 's really great . ; But it 's hideously slow .
Bmr022_230	Uh , OK , yeah . So the only ; That might work too . ; Yeah , I was just thinking that actually temporally just , uh , uh , uh , an increasing tones so that ; Oh , OK .
Bro014_514	is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps , ; which is , um , MFCC ; but with a voice activity detector . ; And apparently , uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number .
Bro005_1361	What 's what 's that ? ; Um , I 'm trying to ; um So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this this multi - band um , belief - net structure . This guy did ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_688	Right . ; Uh . ; I mean it it 's sort of I mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've you know , I I 'm bored . ; Yeah .
Bro023_478	right ? ; No , I don't think so . ; Is it on Italian ? ; Y i
Bmr019_108	Right . I mean , a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits , ; it 's it 's ; so it 's it 's a very different task than sort of the natural . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_932	Huh . ; and it hangs down . ; There 's a little b bulb ; Yep . It just ha just hangs down there .
Bmr015_202	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_235	OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while ; and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , ; Do something different , ; yeah .
Bro004_316	Um ; OK . Well . We we we may just need to uh ; So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , ; and going to a different language um
Bed015_1114	Um . ; Right , " this guy I know from school came for dinner " does not mean , um , " there 's a guy , I know him from school , ; and he came over for dinner " . ; That 's not the same effect .
Bmr026_985	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz they were self consistent ; but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate .
Bmr011_644	but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . ; And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , ; I see . ; one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something .
Bdb001_1194	No . ; It 's it 's all a question of semantic . ; No . ; But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions ,
Bdb001_1009	So . ; So , I guess , ; yeah , ; if if you and Don can if you can show him the P - file stuff and see .
Bmr028_211	for presentation in , uh Uh I wouldn't be ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop .
Bmr030_594	It 's just another ; They couldn't use C Ds ? ; No , because the transcription company does what they do . ; They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in
Bdb001_319	I mean , that sounds good . ; I I was just looking for something ; I 'm not a database person , ; but something sort of standard enough that , you know , if we start using this we can give it out ,
Bmr001_367	I think we have three of those . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , and the h ; Uh , there 's one in my office .
Bed002_6	Check one . ; Check one . ; And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . ; So , which is my bar ?
Bro027_1639	so that 's the ; Yeah . ; So we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_99	I mean , so , if you wear it sort of around the back , it 's not too bad . ; And ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1593	Yeah . ; and then I used this one . ; For all the languages . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1100	Yeah . ; Uh . Uh . Yeah . ; Yeah , so we should find out if it 's really better . ; I mean if it
Bro027_2011	And maybe Barry Barry will be around . ; And ; and then uh , uh , we 'll start up again with Dave and Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the , uh , twentieth . ; No .
Bmr012_746	I don't think we even know which one ; I assume you 're using syncat to do it ? ; No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample . ; Or sound resample ?
Btr002_3311	So , ; Oh , right . ; Right . Oh yeah . ; OK .
Bmr011_1204	which is that , um , if , uh if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . ; For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping ; potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2535	In your new machine ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Is it with s ; It 's it really come down to the driver .
Bmr005_1002	So there 's probably there 's three to four a week , ; That 's what we 're aiming for . ; that we 're aiming for . ; Yeah .
Btr001_619	cuz I think I think as women it might be easier to differentiate ; Well , there were fewer women , too , ; but I I wonder if a man transcribing all the guys would have had ; Yeah .
Bmr029_885	That hurt ; Actually . ; Oh , no . Sorry . ; Not in the short .
Bmr028_1450	It 's p it it really is part of the jargon . ; But it 's also is ; If they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can't really assume that , then it 's actually the opposite . ; Right .
Bro019_863	Yeah . ; How is it ; I I guess I 'm ignorant about this , ; how does
Bed009_865	Yeah , and and Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um ; Right . ; Yeah , I guess that 's the point is is all the morphology and stuff . ; The word order is is uh not fixed
Bdb001_375	and ; So it 's doable , ; it 's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame - by - frame ; and it doesn't have any kind of ,
Bmr015_824	But , i i uh I mean i i ; but , um , ; other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . ; And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope .
Bed013_25	and myself I guess there . ; And um . ; That 's the mmm actual reason . ; And then I 'm also going up to EML for a day ,
Bro003_1141	Uh , right . ; it 's ; Right . ; yeah .
Buw001_406	I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . ; But it 's not ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know how to do it if until you have a system .
Bmr007_204	so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be ; and so and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . ; No problem . ; And places also which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison different words of course
Bed003_222	So . ; Yeah , ; they 'd all be like pointing to the one node . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_387	Yeah . ; the French and the Spanish . ; The Spanish . ; Maybe for that .
Bro012_305	Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have ; uh ; Yeah , easily four times as many parameters . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_318	Right ? ; That is So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , ; and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . ; Yeah we may run across one or two more .
Bmr026_1255	Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . ; Uh , so that 's like eleven eleven million frames . ; And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . ; So that 's probably That 's probably fine .
Bmr009_1186	I can't do it , but ; Or Boston ? ; And those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know . ; Yeah .
Bro005_285	because this is accuracy . ; Yeah , sorry . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_259	Uh . ; No . ; One ; Yes ,
Bed002_33	You can see the transcript ? ; There 's two large number strings on the digits ? ; So you would just read that one . ; And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines .
Bmr015_1002	and you know about , ; Yeah . ; that in principle we might be able to , um , handle breaths by accessi by using cross - talk from the other things , ; be able that
Bmr019_1378	It 's it 's not the Aurora ; I mean , it it 's it 's actually the Aurora task . ; Maybe they 'll get s ; Aurora 's very specific .
Bmr030_783	How m ; Yeah , it feels funny , ; huh ? ; You 're a data fiend .
Bmr009_139	And for listening it seems to work really well . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1210	I I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be ; I don't know , ; if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way ; um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes
Bed011_58	But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . ; And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . ; So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here , and have them actually record like this . ; Uh record dialogues more or less .
Bmr021_441	Yeah . ; So . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1652	two target speakers ; and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers . ; You could do that , ; yeah .
Bro003_382	there 's there 's , uh ; This is complex . ; So , ultimately , uh , as I was saying , I think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_630	Yeah . ; The expanded files and things like that . ; OK . ; They take up a lot more room anyway .
Bns003_1006	And to p uh , to have , in principle , the pro and cons of , uh , different of all these different approaches . ; So that 's the only new member . ; Who is that ? ; Sven Buchholz .
Bmr027_1492	stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step . ; Right . ; We did get our , um ; I 'll be interested .
Bro007_571	OK ; well I I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about ; or or are we done ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_223	Exactly . ; And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . ; but ; OK .
Bro010_919	uh , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit ; but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , ; um , this issue of where the targets come from . ; So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , uh , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there
Bro014_1178	for the difference ; and this is the difference . ; This is the difference . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1253	You don't have anything to say . ; Nah . ; No . ; Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this
Bed015_695	or the construction ? ; or not . ; We 'll we 'll again defer . ; Or I mean , or or , uh
Bed015_1309	Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . ; These are all so far these structures , especially from " path " and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots . ; Now with " cause " , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . Right ? ; So you 'll say , " event one causes event B
Bmr031_1053	What are we doing ? ; I mean , I 'll start if you want . ; I 've been , uh , most recently rewriting Transcriber in Java for no particular reason . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1285	maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other ; or the same applies for MPLS , for instance , ; maybe they are only portions available , ; how to deal with that when the islands are not available
Bmr024_1586	Oh , you don't . ; OK . ; Alright . ; Alright .
Bed017_607	and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . ; Yeah , I know . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bmr020_735	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; uh , and the directory for this I call it I " ASR zero point one "
Bmr006_1090	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 've got a question .
Bmr028_622	Yep . ; OK . ; and it 's much better if we can keep those together , I think . ; Yeah . It 's , uh , funny looking at some of the transcripts .
Bmr013_129	Um , so , uh . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . ; Hmm . ; It 's gonna be fun to see how we , compare at this . ; Yeah .
Bed013_289	Oh ! Questions , ; yeah . ; I 'll ask Eva about the E Bayes and she 's working on that . ; How is the generation XML thing ?
Bed011_654	So I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put ; " Exchange money " is an errand , ; right ? ; But what about uh
Bro008_280	or Uh um ; And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . ; So it 's not final even if they declared a standard . ; The other hand , they might just say they just don't know enough yet to to declare a standard .
Bro004_789	And uh binary decisions about phonemes . ; Nnn Uh It 's ; Almost . ; But I mean it it it does give a distribution .
Bns002_20	Eh , well , I 'm working in the em Broadband Commu ; Uh , sorry , one interruption . ; This is not related to hearing , ; it 's only for fixing it .
Btr002_1776	Yep . ; Thank you . ; Yeah . ; Let 's see . Have you noti th one of the things that I found is is , um , surprisingly difficult these days is to co is to get certain electronic sounds , to try and describe them .
Bmr007_1238	Of course . ; Interesting . ; I like that . ; Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it 's , uh audible .
Bro004_992	Two e @ @ it 's one . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Whether you would transform together or just one .
Bmr030_647	Yeah . ; Wonder if the ones before that were shortened . ; Yeah . ; The beep files , actually the " shorten " doesn't save a whole lot .
Bmr006_97	So , in general , I was thinking more data ; but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , ; like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_3	I guess . ; OK , we 're on . ; So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . ; Check one .
Bed008_734	Mm - hmm . ; Whatever . ; Then we can make a user state . ; What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility .
Bmr001_730	Um , I had another question briefly about transcription . ; OK . ; So are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it ? ; I mean who 's gonna generate the transcripts ?
Bmr023_165	Just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems . ; OK . ; Ah ! ; Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do .
Bro018_917	The the filters ? ; Which filters ? ; um ; The filter bank which is created by integrating over F F T bins .
Bro014_356	I think the hope would be that it would uh , it would work well for the good cases ; and , uh , it would have reasonable reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro019_191	I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop , ; I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines ; and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1166	Yeah , you don't need to even do that . ; It 's just sort of what what would be @ @ observed in uh in that case . ; Observed when you heard the speaker say " where is X " , or when when that 's been parsed ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_518	Yeah , although the the ; using the close - talking I think would be much better . ; Wouldn't it ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_1075	what 's the utterance go giving us ; Yeah . ; and then what 's the discourse history give us . ; Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes .
Bmr031_755	And I 'm I 'm just thinking forty of them is probably still smaller in area than , uh , one normal - sized drive . ; Actually , what I think what what , uh ; was it was it Dave who was suggesting that , uh , you just get , uh , uh , a a computer ; Yep .
Bmr006_52	but I liked him a lot ; cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , ; Mm - hmm . ; so he 's just getting his feet wet in that .
Bns001_70	uh , today , I have two topics . ; And the first topic , um , we have a new member in our group , ; Miguel Sanchez . ; I believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time
Buw001_313	That 's all you ; Yeah . ; And , you can also have notes of the meeting . ; But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down .
Bro007_61	that 's the reason , yeah . ; Oh let 's focus on them then ; so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ? ; For the f the f first yellow line you mean ?
Bmr014_919	I 'm sorry ; so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it . ; Hmm . ; You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle ,
Bns002_881	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK , this is a question not directly related to these things , ; but maybe that 's why maybe only a short answer .
Bed009_592	it doesn't ; That 's why I 'm saying . ; I think you can't ; it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV .
Buw001_272	That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . ; Yeah , good . ; Good point . ; Yeah .
Bro022_616	which don't have this filter . ; But I don't think there 's any other difference . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1591	But ; But but mostly they are . ; Yeah . ; Mostly they do .
Bmr024_834	i is cheap . ; I mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . ; If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much . ; Yeah .
Bro010_880	OK , ; so at each for each sub - band there are basically , uh , several measures of SNR and and correlation . ; Ah , ; OK ,
Bed014_1346	But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the ; Well , that 's good . That 's I I I think that should be the the core group ; Mm - hmm . ; s Which is fine .
Bro012_265	right ? ; Yeah . ; You said on the other cases you didn't notice ; But . I think ,
Bmr015_750	so I 'm not sure ; The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . ; Yeah . ; You know , y you actually say that here is
Bro003_28	Uh This is what I have for an agenda so far ; Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week . ; Uh a number of us are doing a field trip to uh Uh OGI ; And uh mostly uh First though about the logistics for it .
Bro003_1483	yeah . ; Yeah , ; I mean , my point ; I I want to
Bsr001_1282	and ; so that 's probably that 's probably what ; u ; That 's gonna be @ @ .
Btr002_2387	It would be it would ; Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones . ; Yeah . ; Oh , how interesting .
Bmr011_1543	And I had one other one other aspect of this ; which is , um , uh , uh , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar uh y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . ; Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1126	OK . ; Linguine must be the one in the left - hand corner . ; And ; It 's the one in in that corner , right ?
Bro027_474	So it 's it 's not bad , ; but the problem is still that the latency is too large . ; What 's the latency ? ; Because
Bmr014_508	because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um , ; and so they 'll be a difference in commas ,
Bro011_646	and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of ; just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . ; Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1034	you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm ; because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . ; That , you know , I I I think is the idea . ; And so eh the , nnn the the system eh will have two models .
Bed016_1105	Metonymy , polysemy . ; I love Van Gogh . ; Yeah . ; Ah !
Bmr016_1317	which is which would really be a shame ; because um , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . ; So , right now I 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms . ; Oh good .
Bed005_1145	Yep . ; Right . ; Right ? ; So there 's no numbers .
Btr002_946	Mm - hmm . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep . Yep , yep , yep .
Bns001_1257	different things really for different providers , ; and uh and it 's uh very easy to change it , maybe in the access network , for novel things . ; For instance , that 's one provider domain ; and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain ?
Bsr001_1757	There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e ; Mmm . ; It 's about ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_51	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; He 's he 's done a couple stays here .
Bmr009_647	Yeah . ; but but uh ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1745	The bug of was the the F - seek function in C . ; because doesn't work uh when you eh you try to to to ass n n to do an a dated access to to a file , a big file , eh eh moving the the head of the in the hard disk , eh e forward and backward a lot of time ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_886	I 've I 've discussed it with Thilo and I mean ; in terms of not him doing it , ; but we we discussed some of the parameters of that ; and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that .
Bmr005_205	Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice . ; Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis ; and it would be very hard to tell . ; Right .
Bmr019_639	but it unfortunately is not designed and , um like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command . ; So , the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um ; you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files ; and give those files to the recognizer .
Bmr006_816	Fine . So so ; Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . ; So you 're not using all of the data . ; The All I Exactly .
Bmr031_1084	Mm - hmm . ; And the Transcriber interface is fine if essentially what you 're doing is stringing words together to p to make transcripts . ; Annotating . ; Yep .
Bed006_603	So , " American Beauty " is " American Beauty " , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_349	OK so , th that uh , ; Yes . ; We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . ; Yep .
Bed003_94	So then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about , ; right ? ; Uh the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . ; You know . We had a list of things like " to go " and " to visit " and what not .
Bro023_723	Yeah . ; That makes sense . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_468	Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days ; Mm - hmm . ; Yes . ; I guess they have to send it out
Bro019_1084	uh , ; no training , from this , ; just just plain using the Switchboard . ; Oh . You just take the Switchboard trained ?
Bed009_681	OK . ; yep . ; And and the the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on . ; And then extend it to an arbitrary number of applications eventually .
Bmr013_672	and I just don't have machine time there . ; But , once that 's moved over , uh , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , um , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . um , on the word strings . ; Oh , shoot ! ; Yeah .
Bmr009_534	I was just saying ; I I go on with the with the pitch , ; Yeah . ; aha ! OK .
Bed017_486	but he wants to point to the places w w ; Yeah , so . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert ; Documents that have the answers . ; Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically
Bro022_994	Yeah . ; And ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1257	But with the " what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? " ; Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting ; Going to see the kids . ; You you can keep it on .
Bro027_1831	Am I missing something here ? ; But ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_461	um , factor of two , ; um ; What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you ? ; Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w
Bns001_257	Tomorrow , I will go to Cisco , for instance , ; and I will discuss uh , all this kind of things . ; Maybe they have certain additional activities and they 're interested in the results before ; The benefit here is , in principle , that the results are available .
Bed012_854	No , not just Eva , Eva . ; Like if I u take the V and s pronounce it like it was a German V ? ; Which is F . ; Yeah .
Bro024_858	I think e ; yeah . ; It 's it 's just especially in these segments , ; I mean , you introduce , um , very artificial behavior .
Bmr007_69	Uh , there 's a I mean , there is a a , um uh telephone call tomorrow , which will be a conference call that some of us are involved in for uh a possible proposal . ; Um , we 'll talk we 'll talk about it next week if if something ; Do you want me to be there for that ? ; I noticed you C C ' ed me , but I wasn't actually a recipient .
Bro003_1358	and also to train another neural network with the Spanish digits , ; the database of Spanish digits . ; And I working that . ; Yeah .
Bed009_242	And if the action planner does something with it , great . ; If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really ; at least we want to offer the extra information . We don't really um we 're not too worried . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1272	Yeah . ; I see . ; Good . ; Yeah , no , that I I would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that
Bro018_1170	Um . ; So here 's this other system , which is a lot better , ; but there 's still this kind of ratio . ; It 's something like five percent error with the the distant mike ,
Bro012_800	Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , ; though it is not . ; Which is good . ; Well , the noise part is around zero
Bed015_1228	So by default it 'll be like " true " , I guess , ; you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . ; You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity , ; you know , not don't have it here .
Bmr010_1211	Mm - hmm . ; already transcribed meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I don't know if , um
Bns001_1197	Of course . ; and the work packages are better ident oder what c could be derived for work packages is much better aligned . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro021_1173	using the the noise at the f beginning of the sentence . ; This is the first experiment . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3048	Sorry ! ; I 'm sorry . ; Yeah . Like a a skull and crossbones . ; I feel really bad now .
Bsr001_1036	We ; so . ; I mean , we clearly c should collaborate for the best of everybody . ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1522	Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems ; and there 's a um , a web page for it . ; Y you going to , uh , Eurospeech ? ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1145	I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , ; That 's good . ; but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_1889	But ; Oh , interesting . ; Comparable , ; yeah .
Bmr001_860	Right . ; So , with this next ; You wanna read ? ; Sure .
Bmr027_990	So they 'll be doing that . ; Chuck 's Chuck 's , uh , put that in . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the web ; so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can .
Bro018_1113	And that that was um trained on clean speech only , ; which I 'm guessing is the reason why the baseline was so bad . ; And ; That 's ac actually a little side point is I think that 's the first results that we have uh uh uh of any sort on the far field uh on on the far field data uh for recorded in in meetings .
Bed015_2208	Thursday at one ? ; I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh the talk I have to give at EML ; which highlights all of our work . ; OK .
Bro005_446	Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , " What what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , ; So , just ; Yeah ; so , actually it it it decreased the the accuracy .
Bro010_904	Mm - hmm . ; and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .
Bmr028_333	y right . ; Yeah . Yeah . I like it . ; But let me tell you how I really feel . ; We 're all entitled to our opinions here .
Bed015_707	It 's it 's his thesis , right ? ; OK . ; Anyway , ; right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b
Bed015_1895	And then then we 'll have a at least initial spec of of what we 're actually trying to do . ; Yeah . ; And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_672	They 've been here since the beginning . ; You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing . ; Oh , yeah . ; Right .
Bed012_154	OK . ; Let 's assume this is the output . ; So . ; We should con be able to conclude from that that
Bed014_81	Uh , yeah . ; Yeah , so . ; The uh , Java the embedded Bayes wants to take input uh , uh , a Bayes - net in in some Java notation ; and Eva is using the Xalan style sheet processor to convert the XML that 's output by the Java Bayes for the into the , uh , E Bayes input .
Bmr024_1238	So something 's really seriously wrong . ; So ; Um ; Aha !
Bed009_971	Mmm . ; OK . ; Interesting . ; Not easy .
Btr001_889	And , um , ; i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm I I i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way , ; you know , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_933	we can we can test on s Spanish . ; Yeah . ; But the the Aurora Spanish , I mean . ; Oh yeah .
Bed011_1164	Right . ; Sure . ; Then you can go . ; I mean I I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment ,
Bmr014_394	Mm - hmm . ; Um , one suggestion ; and you may already be doing this , ; but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things ,
Bmr009_1508	w as you move . ; As you play , as you move , as you scroll . ; Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable . ; And this 'll be a hav having the multiwave will be a big help
Bed009_698	and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before ; and the function modeler and a self - description of the um external service haggle it out ; Hmm . ; and you can use the same language core , understanding core to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth .
Bmr022_1393	Yeah . ; I mean , I like that idea ; because even a casual user can always send email to whoever 's in charge , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_400	Which could be a kind of a funny delta . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Oh ,
Bed014_1068	Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , w I would talk to you and figure out everything you know , that you know , see if they 're consistent . ; Yeah .
Bro008_50	So ; So , uh ; Yeah , ; until Saturday midnight , or something , we have
Bro017_1118	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1584	which I think actually is good , the more I think of it , ; that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that . ; I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it it 's it it may not be normalized enough . ; Uh - huh .
Bed006_1607	Uh but you 're a linguist . ; You should ; Oh yeah . That 's why I 'm glad that I 'm not involved in working it out . ; OK .
Bmr016_1789	Right . ; There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and ; So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . ; Yes .
Bed016_126	and they will be incorporated . ; OK . ; Um , the ; It basically says , well " this is construal " ,
Btr002_2618	but not so much as , I never saw that written out phonetically , or whatever . ; Well i ; Well ; well , here 's a question ,
Bed008_143	but ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Welcome .
Bro011_714	play with the spectral subtraction , ; and retry the MSG and things like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1620	but , um , uh , ; uh , to me that sounds equivalent . ; Yeah . ; But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them .
Bro025_38	because it 's difficult when we have to add noise to to to find the right level . ; OK . ; Are you looking at one in in particular of these two ? ; Yeah . So the sh it 's the sheet that gives fifty - f three point sixty - six .
Bro012_1355	has not , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Btr002_727	Yes . Absolutely . ; Oh yeah . Mm - hmm . ; Yes . ; Good .
Bmr007_725	I finally remembered to put , uh put native language on the newer forms . ; We can can't you figure it out from the mike number ? ; No . ; OK .
Bed013_1361	OK . ; You know ? ; I mean , ; Here 's hoping .
Bro007_95	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Um and how does this compare to the numbers ; oh so OGI two is just the top top row ?
Bro014_1489	You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime , ; and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too . ; After the after , uh , the result for the TI - digits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people . ; Yeah , but
Bro023_572	Mm - hmm . ; Fourteen percent , I mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bmr019_907	Um . ; But , yeah , we should try to use what you have . ; I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one . ; Oh , good .
Bmr018_670	Yeah . ; And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something . ; But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and it was a nice uh , you know , it it was zero was the most of them , ; Yeah .
Bro025_533	Um , ; do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ? ; Mmm . No , we don't . ; Yeah .
Bro024_963	and ; so . ; Hmm , yeah . ; Eee - sss - uh .
Bmr023_1014	Mm - hmm . ; If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know ; Right . ; So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was ,
Bmr026_1145	Sorry , I 'm sor ; I missed ; What What 's the key issue here ? ; Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors .
Bro016_57	Mmm . ; But , they raised a very valid point , ; which , I guess ; So , to first order I mean , you have other things you were gonna do ,
Bmr018_873	But it 's really ; And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off ; and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either . ; I mean , we 've i th it 's like you have a merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of , uh , not
Bed017_494	I don't wanna compute the answer , ; so it 's a little bit easier for me . ; Well . Uh , you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_192	so it 's now , universally a ag agreed with . ; And and , als ; I mean , I can't say universally , ; but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , um now , uh don't .
Bro027_813	And , uh ; and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD . ; And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1376	And and then part of it will just be the data presentation , ; you know , maybe if if we have common transcription standards and , you know , that it 's all transcribed ; or ; there 's there 's some integration of the standards thing .
Bed013_37	And I 'm sure all the the people at the airport will be happy to work on that day . ; Yeah . ; You 'll get even better service than usual . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_406	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro027_738	Yeah , ; Yeah , ; and r and ; It would
Bmr022_983	You could use they could use their own . ; Oh , right . So they could use the ; I wonder if you could do an adaptor . ; I don't know if you can or not .
Bro022_744	but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning ; Mm - hmm . ; first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , ; Yeah .
Bmr018_778	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't .
Bmr022_332	And so they can hear something , then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again . ; And so they 're ; I think they 're probably going over and over f sections . ; And then they get confused about whether they 've already put that beep ,
Bed009_870	And it makes a lot more sense . ; Yeah . ; And e ; Yeah , OK .
Bed005_1220	and ; Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true . ; It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that . ; Right .
Bsr001_1666	Yeah , yeah . ; right ? ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1624	I haven't J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email , ; did he , ever ? ; No . ; But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking ,
Bro021_76	Different kinds of errors ? ; I didn't look , uh , more closely . ; Um . It might be , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1337	It 's , uh , not as good . ; It 's not bad . ; How m by how much ? ; Um , it helps a lot over the ba the baseline
Bed005_679	Right . ; Or travel , specifically . ; So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ? ; No .
Bro022_948	OK . ; Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . ; I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem . ; And it seems to be the case .
Bro003_797	Yeah , ; probably so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1940	And , uh , ; Basically . ; Or me . ; Huh ?
Bro005_1097	Oh yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; Mmm . ; Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r
Bmr030_745	It 's all scratch . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; How are we doing on
Bed003_142	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And be able to ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_573	and then see what the spectrum is . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; but ,
Bed009_231	That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently ; whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . ; And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was . ; And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance .
Bed004_527	Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible . ; you enter ; You approach . ; OK .
Bed006_1330	This sounds like a paper I 've read around here recently in terms of ; Yeah it could be not a coincidence . ; Like I said , I 'm sure I 'm just hitting everything with a hammer that I developed , ; Yeah .
Bro019_276	and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? ; Yeah , ; I I 'm not sure how that works . ; Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that .
Bro012_1254	Yeah , I think you sent us all a copy of the message , ; where he was saying that ; I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying , ; but something having to do with the voice activity detector
Bed014_86	Actually , maybe I could try , like , emailing the guy ; and see if he has any something already . ; Sure . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_301	Yeah . ; and then ; I Yeah , I I hope @ @ we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_924	But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; So , we don't know . ; This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one .
Buw001_1536	Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , ; Yep . ; but ; Yeah .
Buw001_494	So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , ; I remember that , ; um , what was the part that " ; And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .
Bmr028_59	It 's just formatting the right kind of , uh , XML ? ; Yeah , it 's just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner ; Actually th he did a SRT file for it . ; Mm - hmm . OK .
Bmr009_725	Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow , ; There you go . ; right ? ; Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment .
Bmr020_1189	so I 'm not stripping out anything , ; just just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech . ; Jane ? ; Yeah ?
Bmr006_92	Yeah . ; Yeah , we we 've only had three . ; So . ; OK .
Bro011_28	Mmm . ; and uh somebody ; eh e and uh ; I guess Chuck you weren't there either ,
Bmr001_851	Right . ; Right ? ; And then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do . ; Yeah , although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest .
Bro026_220	I mean , I don't think we really ; I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . ; In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . ; And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects .
Bmr024_1373	or ? ; That 's what I was wondering . ; W yeah . ; I mean
Bns002_891	I do not have , in principle , really the constraint to uh deal with with uh power savings . ; Yeah , let let me let me answer you uh with a question . ; Uh , If , for example , your car uh you you have uh an endless uh source of of gas , do you think it will it will be a problem , the amount of gas your your car is is using ? ; OK .
Bro028_313	Um , ; and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . ; What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? ; Alright ?
Bro004_1274	and it didn't so badly , ; Yeah , right . ; right ? ; So they did something .
Bro021_414	So ; It 's something that 's also short enough in in latency . ; Yeah . ; Well .
Bmr003_2512	That 's an end ; But but but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's that 's there in front of you is really cool . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006_659	OK . ; I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr002_762	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , yeah . ; I think so too . ; Hmm .
Bmr015_111	you 're not talking about the entire page ? ; Yeah . ; Correct . ; I get it .
Bed002_1041	So that if if we have all these cases ; OK ? ; So we make up cases that have these features , ; OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , " OK , here 's a bunch of cases "
Bro027_646	Two hundred ? ; Well , we don't know . ; They 're still arguing about it . ; Oh .
Bmr008_1224	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database ; and if you 're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l uh s uh whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , you could just grep for " role " and and you know , some some particular value .
Btr002_75	Yeah . ; or something from someone else , ; or an overlap , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_449	So , um , um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , ; and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , ; you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_511	Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , ; it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's not either or
Bro014_1576	And and , uh , the the MSG features were sort of built up with this notion ; Right . ; But , I guess , I thought you had brought this up in the context of , um , targets somehow . ; Right .
Bro018_398	something they were doing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I mean that they 're s probably working with fixed point or integer or something .
Bmr019_795	because the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common , ; so ; And you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech . ; I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words .
Bmr023_1113	Well , you might e e ; So that 's that 's another ; So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1257	Right ? ; So , um ; And that actually helped , uh uh , a little bit . ; Uh - huh .
Bro007_542	What ? ; Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas ; and ; oh , but uh we don't have time .
Bmr009_912	OK . ; Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here , ; so you really wanted to start with this other form . ; No , either way is fine
Bmr018_1573	Right , right . ; Sure . ; But they hadn't even come close to that point . ; All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion .
Btr002_3091	" shoot " type , yeah . ; I 've heard the swearword version . ; Yeah . ; That 's OK .
Bed010_780	Right , yeah yeah yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So you can insert your hand something ; Yeah .
Bed006_1513	This is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions . ; R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine . ; Sure . ; That 's the that was the intent of of it , basically .
Bro028_117	Right ? ; OK . ; Mmm . ; And this is still ?
Btr002_2401	and he 's calculating it in his mind . ; So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing . ; Hmm . ; And i uh , but it 's signaling .
Bmr005_1475	And u I think routinely they would not do this . ; So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere ; Right . ; Great . OK .
Bed015_1832	It 's as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do ; which is the mental the whole s mental space thing . ; And then there 's some other minor things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1228	And this I need to to calcu ; I know this ; Uh - huh . ; and I know this
Bro003_1538	Nuh - uh . ; Yeah , OK . ; Uh , ; are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ?
Bmr018_445	So I I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform , ; Mm - hmm . ; but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll . ; Oh , OK .
Bro005_110	fff um , ; yeah . ; What we see is that these nets are not as good , ; except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best .
Bmr020_1690	Yeah that would be very good . ; Yeah . ; And then we can you know ; Yeah .
Bed009_854	yeah , I 've I 've looked at it ; but but it 's no not much uh information available . ; ah ! ; I found ,
Bed006_73	Me ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I know Nancy . ; OK .
Bro017_719	Oh . ; So if you ; Instead of altering the feature vectors themselves , you you modify the the the Gaussians in the models . ; You just multiply .
Bmr024_899	Year or two . ; Would it be ? ; Year or two ? ; Yep .
Bsr001_2363	Nice falling , ; Oh , yeah , ; Declination , yeah . ; right .
Bmr020_1190	just just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech . ; Jane ? ; Yeah ? ; In terms of the this new procedure you 're suggesting , um , u what is the
Bmr011_1775	right . Exactly . ; energy . ; I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop ; that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events .
Btr001_2671	That 's what I thought too . ; Used to be . ; Oh , ; Hmm .
Bmr016_322	Oh OK . ; But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , ; whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , ; and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data
Bmr008_432	I think it 's softening . ; I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's an important point the other way ; Mm - hmm . ; and I don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it .
Bro013_342	Um . So there is this point . ; Uh . The problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it ; and um , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1008	D d So , does Washi - does does UW wanna u do this wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? ; Uh , for recognition . ; Oh . ; I think they 're doing w
Bro023_1077	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction .
Bmr010_182	You can specify the minimum length of speech or and silence portions which you want . ; And so I did some some modifications in those parameters , ; basically changing the minimum minimum length for s for silence ; to have , er
Bed005_299	So , I mean , why do we even have them ? ; Because if you didn't have them ; Yep . ; Uh , I 'll tell you why .
Bed002_568	Yeah . ; Right . ; But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1091	um ; What what was it trained on again ? ; The one that you used ? ; It 's TIMIT with noise .
Btr001_2399	but it just seems like it 's more prominent than ; You know it really is like a placeholder of some sort , ; Uh . ; like
Bmr030_148	So , ; he didn't know what I meant . ; Oh , so what do you have to do ? ; Hmm .
Bdb001_224	I mean , if you did it at this ; I mean these are long meetings ; and with for every frame , ; You don't want to do it with that
Btr002_2357	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's like ; " tisk " .
Bro021_943	uh ; Well . ; This is the frequency domain ; and we can put u that n the log domain
Bro014_650	it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve , ; and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features , ; and anybody doing this task , uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . ; They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing ,
Bro005_1295	because the other ; Yeah . ; So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to ; So it 's
Bro026_691	right ? ; I I guess , I 'm not sure . ; I just ; No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it .
Bmr022_862	Because each each box in the back room can only take six . ; Oh , to get r to get rid of the wired things . ; So we could ; Yep .
Bed006_896	So the question is are um how to represent when things are linked in a certain way . ; So we know for Enter that there 's Container potentially involved ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's not
Bro017_856	Yeah . ; Because that would be a really f fiddling with the data , ; you can't do that . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed009_812	But is that the kind of thing y ; It sounds like the kind of thing that you were thinking of . ; yeah . ; Yeah I guess it 's similar .
Btr001_2660	is , ; um , ; sometimes when people are reading " zero " , they say " O " , ; Yeah .
Bns001_1738	Uh . ; uh , but is far far away , you know . ; Unless unless we speak about quality of service , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_157	Yeah . ; I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else . ; I you know , I I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them . ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_1718	Right . It doesn't it isn't difficult for us to do , ; Right . ; i You should ; so we might as well just do it .
Bmr028_1749	so ; Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power . ; we can afford we can a ; We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have energies diverted .
Bmr024_989	Just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in . ; Yeah . ; The the CD is an alternative to tape . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_968	Yeah . ; Oh ! ; I mean it ; Right ,
Bro017_700	And is this something that you would adjust for training ? ; Each each ; or only recognition ? ; For both , you would have to do .
Bmr006_1388	Yeah . ; Didn't they have something at Cape ? ; they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . ; And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place
Bmr015_1172	it 's not just incidental ; it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful . ; Because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of . ; That 's our problem .
Bmr015_1150	So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed . ; But outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed . ; So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say " that 's perfectly clean data " . ; Uh do you see what I 'm saying ?
Bro010_865	and , um , ; they have to have targets . ; And so the targets come from EM . ; And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,
Bed008_710	Right . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; But it there 's two advantages ,
Bmr008_1673	You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing ; unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly ; Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure . ; just by counting them ,
Bmr029_32	Um . ; That 's about right . ; Actually , it should probably be ; It depends on who else is using machines ,
Bro018_603	right ? ; Um , i i if is it eh w ; When is nearest - neighbor good ? ; Well , nearest - neighbor good is good if you have lots and lots of examples .
Bns001_1213	Yeah OK maybe one sentence one sentence . ; why it changed so . ; If you 're focussing on the argument chain as follows . I have an application . ; This application has certain kind of requirements .
Bns002_182	uh , you know , and finally , uh , another non - military applications , where uh maybe a network is available , like for example , a room like this , ; where we have , in fa in fact , a wired infrastructure , ; but this uh possible application of ad - hoc networks could be uh , any place , any meeting room , where we arrive with our computers ; and eh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point , any kind of uh mmm external network ,
Bns002_441	One data p ; at the MAC layer . ; He have to do it for all data packets ? ; Yeah .
Bmr003_636	I have such a hard name . ; I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . ; Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . ; Right ?
Bro012_986	Well , if you compare the first figure to this one ; Actually the scale is not the same , ; but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger . ; Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero .
Bmr019_609	Mm - hmm . ; And then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro022_914	Well , you can imagine ; The way I use a an a " AND " operator is ; So , it I , uh ; Is ?
Bro003_1628	which means it 's not backed up . ; So , ; um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks . ; And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there .
Bmr011_63	That would sorta be an obvious thing to discuss . ; Um , ; An - anything else , uh , strike anybody ? ; Uh , we started running recognition on one conversation
Bmr002_1352	Um . ; Do we ; Well I think the answer is we need to record as many as we can . ; OK .
Bmr018_694	I don't know which You probably know which one I mean , it 's where you were on the lapel and Morgan was sitting next to you ; and we can hear everything Morgan says . ; Hmm . ; But and and some of what you I mean , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk .
Bns001_1248	Mm - hmm . ; That means the wireless networks ; because that provides , in principle , the mobility . ; And these mechan
Bed016_1005	where wh where where was , um , ; " where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? " ; Or something . ; Uh , yeah .
Bro010_1023	Other low level detectors ? ; Yeah . ; Um , ; uh Let 's see ,
Buw001_113	y if if we were able to to do that . ; Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . ; So action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1525	and different ways of perhaps generating it . ; And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh we 're gonna look at for features . ; Uh , one is just looking at , um , the first cepstral coefficient ; and , uh , using that .
Bro022_428	I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . ; Uh , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , ; or ? ; I
Bmr005_387	This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together . ; Well So let 's ; For ; So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time ,
Bed015_1360	Situation . Right , right . ; in in our in our s terminology , " want " can be an action ; and " what you want " is a world . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2332	OK . ; Yeah . ; yeah , we 're not doing digits in the in the room set up at all . ; We 're doing it for a complete
Bsr001_264	Yeah , this is just m bad design . This , um , this is ; We c we 'd we 'd have to buy new ones . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_90	right ? ; Next weekend , week from ; Next weekend ? ; That is right .
Bmr025_643	Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh ; I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? ; Um unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . ; Yeah .
Bed009_845	Hmm . ; Uh . ; And have you looked ; uh just again for context
Buw001_2264	Uh - huh . ; Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics ; and not any of the facts . ; That is , I I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today .
Bro022_1232	OK . ; OK ? ; Why don't we read some digits ? ; Yep .
Bmr015_768	Using the energy of the of the multiple of the frequency . ; But ; Of all the harmonics of that . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_622	no he 's completely gonna rewrite everything . In Java . ; OK . ; OK so that 's interesting . ; Yes I was just that 's my next question
Bmr020_1772	why would they treat them differently ? ; Yeah . ; Well because one of them ; Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it .
Bmr015_1112	Yeah I mean I 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things ; and these things are somewhat self - aligning , ; so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a " breath " or a " breath - in " or " breath - out " , the models will learn that sort of thing . ; Uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are .
Bmr016_1910	I don't know . ; I think maybe something like that . ; Something like that ; maybe , yeah .
Bed011_129	And says " Sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . " ; And we sort of get the idea what people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human , or know , or assume they speak to a human . ; OK . ; Huh .
Bro005_293	because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . ; Yes , better . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro027_714	and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit , ; but ; I mean , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape . ; Yeah ,
Bro004_415	Yeah , that would be interesting . ; Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , ; but but , um , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? ; I mean no no mixture but just
Buw001_1379	Sure , sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that I mean , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_228	OK . ; Yeah , apparently , um they had better results when they increased the number of states . ; From from eighteen to twenty , or ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_16	I 'm a May birthday , yeah , ; so I have to ; Oops . ; Barbara told me .
Bed008_811	So ; what makes things more likely that ; So ; Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .
Bro010_877	Uh ; Right , ; so the ; OK ,
Bro018_932	So you can specify a different number of filters , and whatever um uh you specify , the last ones are gonna be ignored . ; So that that 's a way that you sort of change what the what the bandwidth is . ; Y you can't do it without I think changing the number of filters , ; I saw something about uh that looked like it was doing something like that , but I didn't quite understand it .
Bro011_54	So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . ; Well . ; Uh - huh . ; There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best
Bed002_975	To come as close as possible to it . ; Th - the terminology we 're using is to ; Yeah , it 's @ @ . ; Go back .
Bmr016_265	Well i i individual human glottis is going to be different for each one , ; OK . ; you know , it 's just There 's so many things . ; OK .
Bmr009_401	because it would be the quickest thing for him to do . ; He could You see , he already has all his stuff in place , ; Yeah . ; he has the histogram mechanism ,
Buw001_450	No ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Somebody who 's part of the meeting . ; No , I mean , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker
Bmr007_1278	So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ? ; You 'll lose it . ; There 's no way around that . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1382	and I 've seen this , like , within ; well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways . ; And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful , ; Huh .
Btr002_136	because it 's like , you know , we know that there 's no Annette on any of the meetings we 've ever dealt with , ; Right . ; Right . ; but , um , it 's , you know , conceivable .
Btr002_2571	Which is I would just say " laugh " for that . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . ; Laugh . Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1294	Yeah . ; So therefore , you can , ; um ; Does STM do it per word , or por per utterance ?
Bmr001_214	OK . ; Well If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro010_363	Context ; K KLT . ; Oh . KLT . ; KLT
Bmr001_102	OK , so this is Morgan . ; I 'm going to read some numbers now . ; That 's my group . ; So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them .
Bed006_51	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Thanks . ; OK .
Bmr015_280	right ? ; So you got the note ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? OK .
Bsr001_2446	One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four . ; Uh ; Yeah , ; it 's TI - digit strings .
Bed016_830	Well , there I thought or there was a paper on it . ; Who ? ; Out . ; Huh ?
Bmr006_1172	I mean ; Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right
Bmr020_1325	the dead meetings . ; Yeah , ; get ; That 's it .
Bmr006_738	So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? ; Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , ; Mm - hmm . ; only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity ,
Bmr007_482	And the reason is because I think there 's a limit there 's an upper bound on how many you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility . ; When we speak we we do make a judgment of " can " you know , as adults . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed006_1443	and then ; So you always need the whole body of of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what . ; Or you always send it along with it , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1202	Well , there is the Avendano work , ; Right . ; but also trying to mmm , uh trying to f t find the de - convolution filter ; but in the
Bmr025_22	And uh ; and uh , ; uh I 've been uh finishing up the uh double checking . ; I hoped to have had that done by today
Bro012_348	Sorry . ; So um , how 's it going on the ; Um . ; So . You you did some things .
Bed003_469	right now we only have three values , ; but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . ; Mm - hmm . ; Rather ,
Bmr027_129	OK . ; So that 's very clear ; all the way down the page , " OK " . ; And they have two options
Bmr018_1424	so . ; Well there 're ; A lot of different ones . ; this was the last day ,
Bns001_838	That was never discussed in detail . ; " Network Services and Applications " . ; So , everything in the world . ; OK .
Bmr029_315	Right . ; Wow . ; Yeah . But if you So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day . ; We also have more machines now .
Bro014_158	Mm - hmm . ; But it 'll it really increases what we can run on . ; Hmm . Cool . ; So , together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments .
Bro016_403	I see . ; Yeah . ; Just summary of the experiment and the conclusion ; and
Bmr020_246	everyday conversations . ; Hmm . ; It 's s what these conversation analysts have been studying for years and years there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1632	Ben ? ; I think it 's Ben actually , ; Ben , then , ; Ben .
Bro005_330	Um ; But w ; The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1658	Seven hundred eighty . ; Yeah . ; Of " OK " , yes . ; OK .
Bmr001_835	They they sheep they s they they speak cheap English , ; right ? ; OK so we 're degenerating , ; right .
Bns002_1544	Paez . ; Not not Paez . ; Not . ; Peire , P E I R E .
Bro018_733	Yeah . ; OK . ; um ; Is that what you 're
Bro019_1660	I guess we should do digits quickly . ; Mmm . ; Oh yeah , digits . ; I almost forgot that .
Bro028_1001	it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way . ; It 's like a greedy ; Well , it 's it 's much simpler . ; But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say .
Bed015_1478	you know , " these guys " , ; all these expressions , nuh , are in in much the same way contextually dependent as " here , " and " now , " and " there " ; Mm - hmm . ; Now , this is this is assuming you 've already solved that .
Bmr010_199	Yeah . ; That 's it . ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_2052	And then it will enable you ; she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bns003_875	Yeah . ; Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_354	Right ? ; So that you have no distinction between those and ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr016_159	How much of this do you need ? ; with uh the ; It 's actually unclear right now . ; I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups ,
Bmr027_1315	So there 's another hundred gig . ; So . ; Alright . Great . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1033	or very close . ; Yeah . ; Um And I don't know how they filled that out . ; But th if Midland
Bro017_73	right ? ; I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_970	Yeah , yeah , OK . ; Originally the idea was from CMU . ; Mm - hmm . ; From C .
Bmr029_205	For the test set . Yeah . ; So , ; Yeah , fo ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1528	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; that , uh , their suggestion of of ; Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models ,
Bmr003_2037	Clink ! ; Let 's see see what it does to the ; Clink ! ; But this was the uh just just to review ,
Buw001_1139	Yeah ? ; Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . ; Is someone picking you up ? ; Um , what 's our schedule ?
Bmr011_1655	Well I had asked some some of the students at the business school . ; Yeah . ; I know ; student groups c like clubs , things like that .
Bro024_1265	what 's it trained on ? ; Oh oh . ; Sorry . ; Uh , it 's Italian TI - digits .
Bmr002_1132	Oh , so , that would be interesting as well to do that . ; Oh ! ; Yeah , cuz you 'd get you get ; you get a certain amount of spatial information .
Btr001_199	and still ; you know , ; I I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can ; and I I just felt like you know , with the German accents , just for me personally , those were probably the toughest to get around .
Bmr021_244	Yeah . It 's uh ; Well , if you 're gonna go to all wireless , ; Oh , you mean in the meantime . ; This one .
Bed003_1363	right ? ; simply by parsing it . ; And this um m won't differentiate between all modes , ; yeah ?
Bmr019_1330	Right . ; I mean , a a monetary interest . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_742	Yeah . ; o ; You 're on recor you 're being recorded ; Yeah .
Btr001_335	Yeah . ; So when he said " sign - yah " , and it sounds like " sign " , he was saying " signal " . ; I remember , yeah . ; Yes . Yes yes yes .
Bmr028_1684	Cuz it would really be ; I mean , this is the reason why I haven't gotten back to it , is cuz my first pass at it didn't really work ; because all the mikes have different noise levels . ; Right .
Bed010_783	Yeah . ; and there 's a correspondence between ; Yeah . ; So I played with it .
Buw001_832	uh , and and will include all that . ; Mmm . ; Um , ; I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up .
Bed016_373	I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , ; so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people ; how what 's happening there , ; plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works ,
Bed014_946	by the data collection . ; Oh . ; So we have subjects anyway Except for this week , we have subjects in here . ; That 's why it was one .
Bro028_1099	um ; we have our we have our RASTA features and ; and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping , uh , from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_235	and then make comments on what you want me to change ? ; No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . ; I I 'm what I 'm what I 'm I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it ; so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something .
Bed005_27	We d Do we know ? ; Um , fifty was our sort of our first ; OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , ; not necessarily by any means all students
Bed014_754	and the local rules are if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done . ; Oh , s ; OK . So if , you know if this is seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done . ; Mmm .
Btr002_2477	But but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture , ; Yeah . ; It could be . ; a definite type of thing .
Bmr024_530	And , uh , they 're doing a travel task . ; And , uh , it involves starting I believe starting with a ; It 's it 's always the wizard , ; but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , speech generation system .
Bed015_2044	Yeah . ; And it may or may not be the best way . ; I 'm sorry , ; you had news .
Bed011_144	Tomorrow , ; well we don't know for sure . ; Because we don't know whether that person is coming or not , ; OK .
Bmr011_1755	yeah , what you said , cross - talk . ; All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , uh , techniques . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so it 'd be w good to know about it .
Bmr010_409	Yeah . ; Um ; The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change . ; Yeah .
Bed013_56	And we sat around and we talked ; and he came up we came up with a pretty strange idea . ; And that 's what I 'm gonna lay on you now . ; And um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva
Bro007_479	Yeah . ; We don't know is happening . ; Yes , so I mean I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday ; Tuesday .
Bro018_514	Right . ; just to get an idea a rough idea of h if it really even makes a difference . ; You can get a little feeling for it that way , ; Yeah .
Btr001_578	Oh , wow . ; Euh . ; and you had to kind of ; you could switch signals ,
Bmr019_1295	We - I ju Otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline . ; I don't know , m ; I mean , u u Jane likes to look at data . ; Yeah .
Bro027_637	mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . ; It could be eighty ; and and probably do @ @ ; Yeah ,
Bmr022_325	uh i um ; They 've got headphones ; and then I guess they have a computer , ; and they have a foot pedal
Bed004_704	we we have uh ; I was just made some examples from the ontology ; and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this , ; but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth
Bro011_58	w m ; Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . ; Well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_450	Are you discovering anything , uh , that makes you scratch your head as you write this report , ; like why did we do that , ; or why didn't we do this , ; Uh .
Bmr007_440	Yeah , I I don't di I agree with that . ; In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap . ; Uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time ; and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " .
Bro012_1318	Mm - hmm . ; and it 's a good choice for ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_758	So you just pick one , with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it . ; Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed006_1234	And what are some types of that ? ; And an Enter , a View , an Approach . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bro003_997	Mm - hmm . ; That 's a good question . ; What about combinations of things ? ; Oh yeah ,
Bro028_1008	But it 's a different take at how to approach it ; and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done , ; uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things . ; So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try .
Bed014_360	you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . ; Right . ; Um , ; and it would take a really long time to explain it now ,
Bro024_354	w OK , ; so in that situation , though , th maybe what 's a little different there , is I think you 're talking about there 's only one ; it it it also depends ; we 're getting a little off track here .
Bro017_401	Mm - hmm . ; because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers , uh and uh and uh TRAPS . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_639	Mm - hmm . ; You see , the idea is that the , um , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly . ; Oh , OK . ; Hmm .
Btr001_1549	Uh - huh . ; I liked ; You miss ; Yeah ,
Bed013_214	Oh ! That 's n ; Oh . ; that 's that 's nothing for those neural guys . ; I mean , they train for millions and millions of epochs .
Bmr002_794	and uh ; so it 's it 's um pretty broad - based . ; " TEI " is ? ; These things do seem to be
Bro017_809	After you train the model , you sort of y you could do you could do still what I was proposing initially , ; that during the training you you compress C - one that becomes then it becomes less important in a training . ; Mm - hmm . ; But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model .
Bmr016_1295	Well the " QUAL " can be The " QUAL " is applying to the left . ; Right , I just meant the middle two ones , ; Yep . ; yeah .
Bmr008_719	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_546	Buy more disk space . ; Is that ; Well , uh , at some level at some level . ; I usually do a mix .
Bro005_817	Um , just you can just sit here . ; Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones ; but it 's uh ; Just uh , have a seat .
Buw001_1666	i ; Edwards at ; ICSI . ; OK .
Bed011_783	And , Timing , uh , uh , Length would definitely be part of it , ; " Costs " , ; " Little money , some money , lots of money " ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_458	I mean you get a better performance with log energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , um , maybe once we have this noise compensation , I don't know , we have to try that also , whether we want to go for C - zero or log energy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1235	So , what exactly is mean by " application " ? ; The application , for instance , here , that eh the interactive classroom . ; But elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio ; Yeah .
Btr002_2793	I have more false starts and things . ; Really ? ; Yeah . ; I don't know if it 's It could just be because there 're so many more hours I haven't been talking .
Bmr014_665	I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . ; And then um if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , I
Bro010_830	Oh , OK . ; Well , the low level detectors are logistic regressions . ; Um , ; and
Bed017_552	And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , ; Mmm .
Bro003_978	Um , ; Also , we can clean that . ; no , no , ; No .
Bed014_844	Yeah . ; Ri - No . Absolutely . ; So , uh , wh you had you know you ha You had done one draft . ; Yes , and , um , it 's Ha - None of that is basically still around ,
Bed009_557	And not just um say um um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states and th these states really are fixed in in a certain sense . ; Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner " ? ; You have to ; Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner
Bmr018_623	Just just something really wrong with ; Oh . ; In the recording ; A bug is what I mean ,
Bro027_292	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , ; it 's like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for us .
Bed003_1050	W Ah , it was dead . To the world . ; God ! ; OK . ; Through the old Notepad .
Bmr027_596	Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it doesn't seem that ; that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . ; So . ; Well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be .
Bro005_1227	or @ @ ; Um , well I don't think we 're um completely off the wall . ; I mean I think that if we if we have ; Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do
Bmr015_1201	And we don't either . ; I mean so so the thing is it 's it ; right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting , ; and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations
Bro007_347	Mmm . ; Alright . ; It 's not clear here . ; OK .
Bmr003_819	But but it op ; If we 're just doing silence detection ; I knew you were gonna do that . ; Just saw it coming .
Bmr025_929	doesn't it ? ; Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . ; I mean ; But I mean , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition ,
Bmr007_135	Mm - hmm . ; Yes , very true very true ; Yeah Yeah ; Yeah .
Bed004_684	Right . ; It 's you know , it 's great is is , you know , as one step toward uh toward where we wanna go . ; Also it strikes me that we we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a uh , a specification for some interface , here that um takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it . ; Then we discussed in our pre - edu EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology
Bmr003_2599	P Z Ms cost a lot . ; But anyway you 'd save , on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system . ; So actually that might be attractive . ; Right .
Bmr002_363	However , they do have software these days which with a digitized uh record you can have control over replay through some sort of an interface . ; Yeah . ; Um . I 've never used one of those . ; I know it would be an a wonderful idea .
Bro017_561	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1061	Well , yeah . ; That 's fine . ; So , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context , ; but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap .
Bro019_146	Yeah . ; is the rough division of ; Exactly . ; Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently
Bmr015_524	uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . ; You know , so " zero zero two " ; The problem is that they 're a lot of fields . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_88	OK . ; Yeah , it 's alright . ; So , the gain isn't real good . ; We 're recording ,
Bro013_375	I mean , uh i if if there 's a if if ; I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk ; but um if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_151	Except the time - line is gonna be huge . ; If you say ; Yes . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_1805	But they ; Right . ; And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , ; Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated .
Bed014_492	Mm - hmm . ; So assume these are two , uh , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bed015_875	So . ; You know . ; It 's ; OK . Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in in absence of all the oth
Buw001_481	I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the uh , th this , e um ; I think that the ; now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . ; It 's it 's not ideal ,
Bro023_1651	which is a perfectly flat spectrum . ; And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because , um , you whiten you just , uh , have a function the whitening is a function of the speech probability , ; so it 's not a hard decision . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_171	Uh , it 's on the transfer function . ; So ; Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_278	No . ; A Anything which is distracting or painful , is going to impact negatively with this . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr009_1536	Well , I 'm I probably would be trying to use the whatever 's there . ; And it 's useful to have the ; Why don't we we see how Dan 's works and if it If we really need the display ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1197	Yeah , you can either beep or it can be silence . ; OK . ; I I couldn't decide . which was the right way to do it . ; Ah , yeah .
Bmr005_1225	It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , ; and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup . ; Right . No , I think that 'd be great , ; So , I I I I was thinking of looking into that .
Bed015_1369	Causal stuff we absolutely need . ; Mental space we need . ; Mm - hmm . ; The context we need .
Bmr013_70	My feeling is that ; we discussed this right before coffee ; and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , ; but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them .
Bed008_943	Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up . ; Yeah . ; Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S ; Yeah , right .
Bmr006_34	I don't know . ; Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? ; Is it ; Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up .
Bed010_455	Right . ; OK . ; If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure ; Yeah .
Bro022_863	Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or , uh stop consonants , or something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_986	Yeah . ; Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? ; Why not just do it all ourselves ? ; Um , it 's historical .
Btr001_2055	Oh . ; Oh , wow . ; I think that would be really interesting . ; Oh I see .
Bro016_722	But , ; um , ; when they are used on on the SpeechDat - Car data , it 's not the case ; oh , well .
Bmr001_862	You wanna read ? ; Sure . ; OK . ; How many more you got ?
Bed005_867	Mm - hmm . ; So once that 's done , then all the rest of it is , uh , sort of , you know , what we want to do for the research . ; And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all . ; Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that .
Bro004_714	but perhaps not not so much ; Right . ; because I think the neural networks learn perhaps to ; even if the features are not normalized . It it will learn how to normalize
Bro004_1221	Uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . ; And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . ; But they 've been looking at uh at these issues . ; At the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection .
Bmr002_1443	So you can charge more for it . ; That 's probably why I thought he was the chairman . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; That must be it .
Bmr002_263	Yeah . ; and the voice . ; Just no way . ; Well , don't you
Bmr021_475	I think you put them on XE . ; OK . ; So . ; Well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it w with a with a meta disk allocation , you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on XE were on the same
Bed013_437	It hurts . ; It hurts . It hurts real bad . ; It does ! ; But that 's what you get for coming late to the meeting .
Bmr021_922	Yeah , and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors . ; Yep . ; And that would blow up the ; You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they 're uh orthogonal .
Bro008_260	shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part . ; So , if you can if you can add those in um then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half . ; Yeah . ; So it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal 's side , take what they did , if it if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish ,
Bmr015_144	Yeah . ; the speakers who we had is is at least interesting . ; So you um , how many digits have been transcribed now ? ; Four thousand lines .
Bro027_1129	But after cleaning up you have now a different set of S N Rs , right ? ; Yeah . ; For the training of the neural net . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_208	but you know , the basically , you know everyone 's saying " yes " or you know , or ev even more sp specific than that . ; So , uh , the point is that , um overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . ; And that 's all I wanted to say on that , unless people have questions . ; Well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps .
Bed015_1966	Huh ? ; Can I ask a quick question about this side ? ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bro012_606	S ; Or , is that what is that ; Yeah we are We are trying to to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits , ; Right .
Bro027_895	Ah . ; It 's a multiple of seven . ; and ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1102	N ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So , I u I do
Bed014_1199	In the in analogously to the way you would do " someone fixed the car with a wrench " . ; And then you hand it back to your hippocampus ; and find out what that , you know , ; Means .
Bro007_367	Yeah . ; We can ; yeah . ; Sure .
Bsr001_640	you know , ; but worse , you know , environmental conditions . ; Worse acoustics . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1399	We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection . ; Uh - huh . ; And we can do that in parallel with some other filtering you can do . ; Mmm .
Bmr026_1110	That 's That 's weird . ; No I mean it 's weird that it did ; Oh ! ; That 's what I said .
Bmr010_654	and ; And there 's no adaptor for it ? ; Seems like there 'd be a ; Yeah .
Bro005_866	Aha ! ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; The pronunciation models and so forth
Buw001_929	And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , ; You know , what you can do with things . ; OK . ; so we could probably get more as well .
Bed006_354	Yeah . ; The question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed014_386	um ; there was this , uh thing that Nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that ; Hmm ! ; I was really strong .
Bmr024_1271	and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results . ; So ; But there 's ; It looks like there will still be some difference ,
Bro012_481	Oh , the baseline , you mean . ; Yeah . ; Well I don't I 'm not talking about the baseline here . ; Oh . Oh .
Bro003_1864	y can't print on ASCII . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I see . ; So the SAMPA 's just mapping those .
Bmr015_271	and then I was never informed ; but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , ; so . ; Right .
Bmr013_774	I could get that new one in this week I get that new one in . ; Yep . ; We 're gonna be recording them every Monday , ; u
Bro027_1031	What 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? ; Oh , ; I know what I was gonna say . ; Um , not no relation .
Bmr025_349	at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that ; cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it ; and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point ; Yeah .
Bmr005_698	Uh - huh . ; Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ? ; OK . ; OK . I I I I w I I wanted to
Bmr031_436	Yeah . I mean , it 's just slightly more complicated , ; but it 's but i you can you can go from any frequency to anyth any other frequency . ; So it 's ; Well , the the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ?
Bmr018_1339	and they 're they 're gonna be real meetings , ; it 's just that they 're with str with people who would not be meeting otherwise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1820	Yeah . ; But but if if out of context , they can't tell if it 's a channeled speak uh , you know , a close - miked speaker or not , then that would be confusing to them . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro023_1538	Um , ; actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , um , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , uh , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , uh , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha uh , correctly separated . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if you take these minima , it b they will overestimate the noise a lot .
Bro019_189	And uh , then , when one of those finished you 'd fire off another one . ; Um , ; I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop , ; I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines
Bro027_1698	I mean ; Because most of it is sil ; I mean , we have dropped some silence f We have dropped so silence frames ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_824	So when we say " transcribed " , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM , ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; or completed transcription ,
Bro019_681	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But they d the everything I mean is like , ; but there
Bro003_1168	ru running on what machine ? ; Uh , Ravioli . ; Uh , ; I don't know what Ravioli is .
Bro027_1572	And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . ; So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , ; m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands ; and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them .
Bmr019_166	And , um , ; that was the phone - loop adaptation . ; And then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses . ; And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances ,
Bdb001_1316	Or she . ; But still they ; Exactly . ; Sure .
Bed005_754	Mmm . ; Uh , you need some mechanism for ; Yeah . ; Or , you know , the church across from City Hall ,
Bro023_1678	How much ; It 'll keep going till I guess when they run out of disk space , ; It went a little long ? ; I mean , disk
Bro023_1694	Mm - hmm . ; For this it might help , ; um ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_764	I don't know . ; Well , with the way we 're defining it I think yeah . ; W w ; but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free
Bed015_964	But , um , ; OK . ; So ; OK , that was one comment .
Bmr010_1074	That 'd be great . ; I I don't wanna say that by fiat . ; Hmm . ; I 'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful .
Bmr003_971	but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . ; Yeah . ; I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , ; That 'd be so great .
Bmr006_1494	OK . ; Oh , yeah . Sure . ; OK , that 's what I 'm asking . ; Oh yeah , yeah .
Bro016_567	Especially if you talk with him when I 'm not here , ; that 's a topic you should discuss with Hynek ; to , you know , double check it 's OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1194	Right ? ; OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that . ; The question is , " is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval ? " ; Uh - huh .
Bed002_92	but the a but the but the ; Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? " , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the " Jerry "s . ; Yeah . ; Sure .
Btr002_1455	Mm - hmm . ; At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something , ; OK . ; I didn't know about that .
Bns002_370	OK , ; OK ? ; but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet between neighboring nodes , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1748	Like , if you If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need one arrow at each end , ; and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . ; The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that and they sort of swap . ; I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not .
Bro014_953	Well , that 's the rea ; w w what I 'm arguing is that 's ; Yeah . ; I mean , uh , what I 'm arguing is that that that 's givi you gives you your intuition .
Bmr014_112	I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done . ; That 'll help a lot , actually . ; Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting . ; And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting .
Bro027_1557	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think you were . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1667	No . ; You know , when Bush catches fish ; they actually put a bunch of fish in the lake for him . ; Oh .
Bmr018_697	But and and some of what you I mean , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk . ; So , I actually went through all of those , ; there were I think fifty - five segments , um , in in X Waves , and and sort of did a crude check , ; and more often than not , it it gets it wrong .
Bro027_1704	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So ; the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence .
Bmr008_282	Right . ; And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds . ; I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1177	and the the the , uh , the weak link is is recording meetings . ; OK , ; um , ; two questions come , is you know what how how do we
Bmr011_1613	Yeah . ; and before Jose started coming , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_532	Yeah , there are twenty that comes from ; There is ten that comes from the LDA filters also . ; Oh , OK . ; Right ?
Bmr013_950	I have to run it . ; Right . ; In in doing the hand - marking ? ; Yeah .
Bro025_711	Right . ; Yeah . So , um , a better way would be something more more data - driven , ; Mm - hmm . ; just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar .
Bed012_113	Look at that Struct in the the output , ; even though I wouldn't call it a " Struct " . ; But . ; Well i well , it 's an XML Structure that 's being res returned ,
Bmr014_1055	so . wh um I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , ; it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . ; So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . ; Right .
Bed010_594	Hmm . ; That but it wasn't was ; That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames . ; Right .
Bmr023_616	Well . ; So that was stuff he was doing with you . ; I mean , it 's I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1199	No no ; Right . ; so right , ; so this is a good point ,
Bro024_864	Yeah . ; Well , see if you add something everywhere , it has almost no effect up up up on on top . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it and it and it has significant effect down there .
Bro022_1007	Maybe you can ; I think it 's ; That 's it for me . ; OK .
Bmr031_1598	and just did you know , did that , it wouldn't be that bad . ; Because you 'd get some number that would be skewed by be skewed by that ; So you mean , you 're just using a mean and the varian and a variance ? ; You know , uh , uh , X - X X X - X X minus mu over sigma . Yeah .
Bmr025_127	Mm - hmm . ; Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News ; Yeah . ; which I think looks great .
Bed006_1405	Sigh . ; And I think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon . ; So this is nice about being being recorded also . ; Right .
Bns002_963	So you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range . ; Yeah . ; That 's OK . ; And to and to get the maximum network throughput .
Bro003_451	Yeah , yeah . ; Um . ; And and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_869	I don't remember that . ; And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bed009_619	Dialogue manager . ; Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ? ; No , ; no he 's completely gonna rewrite everything . In Java .
Bed002_212	You just blew it off . ; Ah . ; OK . ; It 's really simple though .
Bmr011_647	one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something . ; Mmm . ; So basically ; Or a hundred thirty - two .
Bmr014_473	so gloss of whatever . ; Right . ; I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . ; Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there ,
Buw001_1270	Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? ; As many are willing to do it . ; Make it a voluntary thing , ; Yeah .
Bro018_1094	so it 's a quarter length step ; and I I take that frame and four f the four I take ; Sorry , ; I take the current frame and the four past frames and the four future frames
Bro003_1555	so those are computational servers . ; So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers . ; Right . ; Yeah , I 'm not sure what 's available on
Bmr002_1324	I 'm not going to talk about , you know uh , trying grade them in any kind of careful way , ; but just indicate if th if there 's a prominent word , to indicate it . ; Sure . ; Yeah , that 's great .
Bmr011_899	And and what they 're doing is ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Brian himself downloaded So So , um , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded
Bro013_18	The both the uh the SRI System and the oth ; Um . ; And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of uh training data or not , ; Of data ?
Bsr001_2063	People interested in the speaker separation ; because what you call a turn and the end of a turn , and that it it 's horribly confused if you don't sort of ; Mmm . ; It 's inherently hard .
Bmr013_996	And then , if we like them we 'll get more . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece ,
Bro028_398	But ; But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal . ; There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away . ; And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in .
Bmr010_1152	I think A An - Andreas was leading to this topic , ; the idea that , um , we haven't yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from IBM , ; and it may just be , you know , pristine . ; But on the other hand , given the lesser interface
Bmr019_1175	Great . ; And and and of course ; It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ? ; Right . But it has one the first column has the meeting name ,
Bro022_808	And actually there 's ; Yeah . ; There 's an uh , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation , ; uh , it might still be interesting to work on this
Bro010_268	so you you so you had a ; so you had a a quarter second delay before , uh , plus some little processing time , ; this w ; Right .
Bmr005_640	But , by by the moment , I I don't compare , my my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I I want to do it . ; Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks , ; I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_194	So . ; the SM - ten - A 's , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something .
Bro019_874	It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter . ; Is the signal is is a signal substrate . ; Oh , oh , OK ; so the difference is the KL .
Bmr002_1340	Anything else ? ; Well , so , um ; What is the plan ? ; We 're gonna
Bro018_25	The probabilities of the allophone . ; And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that ; and only have result with with the MLP with the three output . ; And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output .
Bro005_1002	The future work is , well , try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the OGI ; system . ; Um , there are still open questions there , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_982	Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; because of the of high interference levels . ; A lot of simultaneous transmissions also means for each receiver point of view , a lot of neighbors or or nodes transmitting at the same time .
Btr002_798	You know what I would think would be a really n um , neat feature for the interface ? ; Some sort of backwards tab ; where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually , ; Ooh , interesting .
Bmr012_1091	Just order it . ; It 's a lot of money for a handband . ; OK ; and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice
Bmr019_454	But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot . ; So , where were we ? ; Uh Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_243	And you could use that initial speech to do all these adaptations ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; Right .
Bro018_192	cuz we know how to multiply ; and you you 'd be you know much lower error usually if you just multiplied it out . ; But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is . ; And that 's what these sort of dumb machine learning methods are good at .
Bmr018_1145	and then I went through afterwards and double - checked it ; so that one is really very very accurate . ; Oh . ; I men I mentioned the link .
Bmr003_2640	Well it 's a choice if we get a choice , let 's keep talking . ; Sure . ; Do we have more to talk about ? ; No ,
Bro005_735	Yeah , probably . ; or Mmm . ; Yeah . My But I don't know . ; There 's supposed to well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though ,
Bmr026_108	OK . ; So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . ; I 'm just gonna do it . ; And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .
Bro023_947	Right . ; So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be , ; and now i then you 've subtracted it off . ; And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up .
Bed015_1911	For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm . ; So so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , ; the tourist domain and the and the child language learning . ; Mmm .
Bmr029_577	You 'll have email . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , not to mention that that , uh , Mari 's putting together this report next week , too , you know .
Bmr010_717	And then , uh ; Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course . ; And then just close enough so that you get good volume . ; So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it .
Bed003_1775	The data we get from Munich is very command line , ; simple linguistic stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hardly anything complicated .
Bro018_1064	so that 's another possible thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; They they should really shouldn't ; There 's no particular reason why they would be exactly behave exactly the same .
Bmr030_377	Yeah , right . ; Right . ; You know ? So if , you know , if they can be working on that while we 're working on the other things , then when we get them in , they don't have to do that one from scratch , basically . ; Well , pipelined .
Bmr016_2215	I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , ; but I ; Well it 's just we 're missing tea . ; Yeah , I know .
Bed014_358	Oh yeah , like uh , I solved the the problem of um we were talking about how do you ; various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote " count as a noun phrase " , ; you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . ; Right .
Bro003_694	Yeah , ; just the multi - band features , right ? ; And ; Yeah .
Buw001_617	I agree . ; We sh we should ; I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , ; Well , I don't know .
Btr001_77	good . ; It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ? ; It 's basically you have these specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_565	I think so . ; OK . ; I think I think I mean , I think when I 'm when ; Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance
Bro014_826	I what does that mean ? ; we ; The variance of the spectrum of excitation . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1191	Do we have a mailing list that includes uh the OGI people ? ; Yeah . ; Uh no . ; We don't have .
Bns001_1251	And these mechan ; And you see that there 's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks . ; But the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network . ; You have to have in mind always the end to end scope .
Bmr006_581	OK . ; And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . ; Wow . ; Yeah .
Btr001_767	if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like " great " . ; Uh - huh . ; But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the K or whatever and a little bit of the R . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_413	Well , you know , we record here at for at forty - eight or something ; And then we downsample . Yep . ; and then we downsample . ; But forty - eight 's a nice multiple of eight .
Bro013_585	Yeah ; Is another problem . ; Um . ; Yeah , there is th this fact actually .
Bed003_1674	You know . So . ; Unless it boots up with networking . ; It 's plugged in . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_426	Right . ; And so and also I 'd like to do the indirect time line business . ; Um but regardless , I mean , w that 's something that you , me , and Jane can talk about later . ; Um , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages
Bmr011_463	Hmm . ; I think . ; I think they are . ; Oh , cuz what what I had read was , uh , they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this ,
Bmr023_554	Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . ; then it becomes ; That it was the transcrip ; He wanted to do a web interface that would make it
Bmr012_1290	That would be weird . ; It 's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break ; yeah that 's right . ; and I think that 's a good idea ,
Bed017_516	so um , uh I think you must be able to reuse some some existing um , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote ; and then try to integrate them , ; and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small uh , content management system . ; OK .
Btr002_3259	Oh . ; because that 'll make it possible to easily know , you know , who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was . ; The problem with ; I originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent index ,
Bed009_226	There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . ; And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . ; Information related to the user and information related to the situation . ; And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that
Bed002_1195	OK , I wasn't . ; So this was was a usual jo ; Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_479	but I 've got a bunch of ; uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth . ; But , um , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones . ; And it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding
Bmr022_1331	and I would start collecting it here ; and we would end up with two corpora . ; Well , ; And I don't want that to happen .
Bmr012_337	Yeah that was fine . ; The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times ; That that was OK . ; OK .
Bro004_136	But for Italian we choose Spanish which we assume is close to Italian . ; The third test is by using , um the three language database ; and the fourth is ; W which in
Bed017_706	so , uh , they think the money 's coming . ; So and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . ; He was in the White House , ; I don't remember what he was saying .
Bmr016_455	Like a , ; Yeah , just pairwise , ; yeah . ; what do you call it ?
Bro019_1311	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_574	Cheap in terms of their quality . ; So . ; Well , they 're twenty - five cents or so . ; Th - we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a PDA .
Bmr008_1736	That 's complicated . ; too . ; Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ? ; I 'm not sure .
Bmr006_765	a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , ; Based on the ; Uh - huh . ; because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems ,
Bro005_383	Yeah . Uh . ; Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's
Bmr012_529	right . ; Yeah . ; Sheep is good . ; Sounded good .
Bed005_1270	Let 's OK , so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks . ; If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there . ; If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . ; OK .
Bmr002_1361	until we get to the point where we 're fairly comfortable with the hardware and the software and everything works . ; Yeah . ; and then I think I 'll ; also uh a Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few .
Bed011_1153	That 's something I will would sort of enjoy . ; Probably should go . ; That was that 's one you should probably go to . ; Yep .
Bro010_578	It has mistakes . ; Uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable . ; Uh , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just , uh you can do a w a uh an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . ; I guess it is EM still ,
Bns002_320	in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh , used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept a reception is taking place . ; OK ? ; Yeah . ; I didn't get it .
Bed009_515	So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi , ; let 's say . ; Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast , ; take a taxi .
Bro017_841	So . ; I see what you are sa saying , ; Right ? ; Saying .
Btr001_978	Uh - huh . ; Or " a " versus " a " . ; Exactly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_1119	Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . ; Oh actually it 's not that weird ; because we have seen ; We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .
Bmr020_1579	So I So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there a spurt that 's that 's uh , interrupted ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_555	Mm - hmm . ; when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary , then we can actually a put it all together ; Mm - hmm . ; So the speech recognizer also works .
Bmr013_225	Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . ; It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? ; Mitch showed that , and some , dissertations have shown that . ; Right .
Bed015_899	Oh , uh , for sure , yes . ; There are constrai yeah , it 's not every but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_985	We don't have more receivers , ; we just have ; Right , we don ; Right .
Bmr014_277	Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that . ; Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . ; So I did the all that last week . ; So all the all the forms are now on the computer .
Btr002_926	Right , then I 'll drag it . ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah , dragging is really f efficient . ; But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking .
Btr001_719	d but s don't have to be really Yeah , don't doesn't have to be ; Yeah . ; Don't have it just start , ; yeah .
Bed014_1055	Yes . ; Uh . Would you like to ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I wo I would like I would sort of get a get a notion of what what you guys have in store for me .
Bro003_690	Um , ; multi - band . ; Multi - band . ; So there would be multi - band before , um before our network , I mean .
Btr001_2369	kinda like " Uh . " ; You know . ; Yeah . ; And to me that 's more of like the " Maybe this shouldn't be funny
Bmr006_1649	And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . ; You know ; Uh - huh . ; You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part .
Bro017_612	in ; uh - huh , uh - huh . ; So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1860	Yeah . ; And give them freedom to to indicate if it 's just not workable . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro027_170	Uh - huh . ; I mean , that 's a nice noise source . ; Yeah . ; Uh , and there 's also the , uh uh , air conditioning .
Bmr022_788	Yep . ; Uh ; I I just don't ; I mean , I think we we 're we 're getting rid of major differences
Bro013_380	They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping ; But they still want to just to give some um requirement for this VAD ; because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard . ; OK .
Bro014_417	I mean , are you gonna have w uh , uh , examples with the windows open , ; half open , ; full open ? ; Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ?
Bmr026_1065	And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . ; OK . ; Mmm . ; Alright .
Bmr015_451	Yeah . ; Yeah the other things that we have , uh , been working on with , uh , the c with Communicator ; uh , especially with the newer things ; with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level .
Bro025_493	Um . ; OK . ; So , uh , ; what 's , uh ?
Bro012_360	It 's not a mean of word error rate . ; It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , ; it 's a weighted mean of improvements . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_850	maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction , ; or maybe vi maybe the other way around , ; Yeah , ; mm - hmm .
Btr001_2576	Woo - hoo ! ; Ah , the digits task . ; Let 's do simultaneous digits . ; No , let 's let 's not .
Bed016_401	You could get it out of there , or some ; Which I can even email you then , ; you know , like there probably was a little few changes , ; not a big deal .
Bro023_852	because after subtraction you can have negative energies , ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; So what I I just do is to put , uh to to add to put the threshold first and then to add a small amount of noise ,
Bmr008_1510	So if we could , or if you could do some of it , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; yeah ,
Bmr024_514	Because of ; Yeah . ; I 'll can make an can , like , make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one , ; Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens .
Bro004_1316	Are were you folks using Gin ? ; That 's a that just died , ; you know ? ; Mmm , no .
Bmr016_2225	Right . ; And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . ; And , ; OK .
Bmr009_610	Yeah . ; I I think a a another parameter we c we we can consider is eh the duration . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_996	t So i ; So ; No , go ahead . ; So , we may think that if you say um , " where is the theater " , um , whether or not he has talked about tickets before , then we he 's probably wanna go there to see something .
Bro010_1065	right ? ; It 's a it 's a good thing to mark ; and will probably help us ultimate with recognition ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_731	I guess I need to talk to him more about ; Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even , ; and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions . ; You just partition them into multiple .
Bed002_478	The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ? ; Right . ; OK . ; M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .
Bro016_89	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; I mean , y don't wanna do this over a hundred different things that they 've tried ; but , you know , for some version that you say is a good one .
Bmr001_561	Yeah . ; I think probably the bottom four bits are not any good , ; Regardless , yeah . ; Right ?
Bmr011_38	OK , so let 's talk about that a bit . ; I mean , that was ; Uh , @ @ tuss close talking mikes , ; better quality .
Bmr024_333	Right . ; But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits . ; Right . ; You 're talking about as a pre - processing step .
Bmr024_694	I think ; But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus . ; We should let it be its own corp ; Yeah .
Bro022_506	Oh , wow . ; You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , ; and he 's really got something . ; Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ?
Bmr019_928	So there was some speaker identif ; And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before uh , before we had the multiple audio available ; f ; so I couldn't switch between the audio .
Bmr018_1076	And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged . ; Yeah . ; That 's not completely negligible . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_804	because uh your t your model was trained uh expecting uh , ; that wouldn't work . ; Because your model was trained expecting a certain var variance on C - one . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_1270	Oh yeah yeah . OK . ; Yeah . ; What looked different ? ; Yeah .
Bns003_781	and my other next , uh , generation of contract is also going in that sense so the topic is still going go going on . ; and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer , a bigger project um , outside of this goal , with contributions here from , uh first of all from the NSA group and then from from other partners . ; But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management ; and this will happened , I believe , in December ,
Bro014_1582	i it 's not I mean , they 're sort of not in the same kind of category as , say , a phonetic target or a syllabic target ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; or a
Bmr016_1799	y yeah . ; Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . ; It 's just disturbing . ; Right .
Bed010_227	Just fun . ; OK . ; And so you when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer . ; Right .
Bmr003_1209	Good point . ; I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress ; Yep . ; and for this meeting we want "
Bro004_884	Yeah . ; Uh , OK . ; Uh so there is this combination , ; yeah .
Bmr001_450	Hmm . ; Right . ; So I 've I 've already created a " U U , doctor speech , data , MR " directory , or had Jane do it and uh um but there 's not a lot of free space around . ; No .
Bed002_928	Yeah . ; Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . ; I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . ; OK .
Bns002_1148	but but if we take a look at the whole thing , well , we can ask for a a low consumption route , ; well , the same way ; Yeah , but the ; as we are asking , for example , when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life , we can go and say " well , we will we are happy with this UPS ground system .
Bro010_890	And you initialize these parameters , um , in some some way ; and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .
Bmr002_888	It sounds like you 're at least a little familiar with these tools , Jane , ; so Are y Do you feel comfortable just picking one ? ; Um , because ; I 've never used any of them .
Bed006_955	so that this means we can start using it basically now . ; Mm - hmm . ; But this is a technical detail . ; So a pointer a way to really say pointers .
Bed002_1262	S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . ; If if you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they ; You know , just pppt ! ; go on and do other things .
Bro025_342	There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ? ; Oh , no . It actually made it , like , point one percent better or something , actually . ; OK . ; Or something like that
Bmr009_1152	I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning . ; Oh , I don't know . ; And And Um And usually here people here know what is their kind of mmm lang English language ? ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr031_1366	and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise . ; Right . ; And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation . ; So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that @ @ been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the in the Aurora , uh , team .
Bmr026_1127	I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . ; Yep . ; I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_370	right ? ; That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_670	Right , right . ; This is this is for for ANN only . ; And , yeah , the training for the HTK models is always , uh , fixed for whatever language you 're testing on . ; Right .
Btr002_406	g Group . ; OK . ; " Groups of " , ; " gruesome " .
Bro022_486	And , um , ; the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , ; um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . ; They they add in this modulo two pi way
Bmr016_162	I just thought well we 're if we 're collec collecting digits , and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms , I thought it 'd be nice to have them in groups , ; and probably , all else being equal , it 'd be better for me to just have single digits ; since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , ; OK .
Bro017_1197	Maybe we should set that up . ; That would make it much easier . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_282	Yeah , perhaps yeah , there is also TIMIT . ; We could use TIMIT . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro019_885	Wiener filter . ; It 's a it 's a cascade of two s ; Yeah , in general , you don't ; that 's right
Bmr026_857	Right . ; But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there ; So . ; because we 're doing
Bmr031_1153	Yeah . Oh , well . ; I gotta remember to beep that out . ; Who was that ? ; No
Bro015_15	Alright . ; Cool . ; I need a new office mate . ; Oh , OK .
Bro005_1387	Mmm . ; Uh ; I think so , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro003_561	it 's it 's definitely broader , ; yeah . ; But , actually , the issue of phoneti phon uh phone phoneme mappings will arise when we will do severa use several languages ; Yeah .
Bmr016_386	Overlapping digits ! ; The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . ; Alright everybody 's laughing . ; OK .
Bro023_1127	because you have also two two kind of smoothing . ; and ; One in the time domain , ; Yeah .
Bmr026_216	Oh . ; a and in yeah , in terms of of the source code . ; You you can't find the Tcl files anymore . ; Ah .
Bmr018_234	Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; Right . ; OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting , ; and then and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed .
Bmr009_918	so th this is So I was looking at the change first . ; So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi with reference to this . ; So the digit form , ; we had one already .
Bed014_426	And ; So , uh , what was the date there ? ; Monday ; or ?
Bed002_225	down here . ; That 's the Powder - Tower . ; Now , um , we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . ; Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it .
Bed010_938	The the amount You put in your credit card and as well . ; But , uh , ; But anyway , ; so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks ,
Bed002_207	Wel - we I uh I I ; You didn't get it ? ; I don't think I did . ; I guess these g have got better filters .
Bro024_1208	so d the detection threshold is very ; So the v ; The VAD ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Buw001_666	and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . ; someone later might be able to take these and say " OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there ; So ; and here 's sort of what they started talking about ,
Bed011_123	and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that . ; So if you ask " How do I get to the castle " then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here " In order to get to the castle you do " ; OK ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_518	OK . ; Or they just tend to sp peak louder , maybe ? ; That 's true . They do they do say that m men 's voices c carry better . ; Yeah .
Bed005_659	But for the moment just uh , t for this class of of things , we might want to try to encompass . ; And ; Then the scope of this is beyond Approach and Vis - or Vista . ; Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
Bmr027_1323	just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; no big deal " .
Bed005_1052	So Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this . ; Um ; Where should I put this ? ; So , the idea is that , um , Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess .
Bmr013_402	It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed011_43	But I think that might be overdoing it a little . ; So Yeah . ; So let me pop up a level . ; And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same .
Bro019_364	that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system . ; Slightly . ; But , not very significantly . ; And uh , that was
Bed004_97	Because of l all the names , you mean ? ; The names and um ; this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system , ; and um then of course the system broke down ,
Bed008_451	Oh I just created it , it has none so far . ; Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , ; we called them entities , ; Yeah .
Bmr019_260	It 's it 's easy enough to try , ; just run it on ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed011_343	But well th but you did say something important , which is that um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with the simple cases for quite a while . ; Yeah . ; Although , obviously th so so that sa s does suggest that ; Uh , now , I have looked at all the data , and it 's pre it 's actually at least to an amateur , quite redundant .
Bmr027_257	and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere . ; That 's all I 'm saying . ; OK . ; OK ?
Bro018_54	Yeah . ; but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that . ; Uh yeah . ; What are the R 's ?
Bns001_1366	Yeah . ; So that 's why , I think , yeah , it 's a good question . ; Yeah . ; Now , that 's the point why I am focussing on more on the
Bro012_1491	That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits , ; right ? ; Right . ; So . I thought " well I 'm gonna just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . "
Bmr021_745	Or two two differences . ; Oh yeah . ; So the SRI system also does um vocal tract length normalization ; and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features .
Bmr019_1553	Are we recording it ? ; Yeah . ; We won't have enough microphones , ; u
Bmr009_956	Well yeah . ; Yeah . ; Nor - um ; So so what accent are we speaking ?
Bed010_886	is it not ? ; Yes . ; OK . ; So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .
Bed011_921	D Do you mean Do you mean eliciting particular constructions ? ; Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about ? Semantically speaking , eh ? ; Well , yes . ; Both .
Bmr031_1339	Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms ,
Bro004_326	you haven't increased the size of the neural net , ; and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set . ; That that could be . ; Um So , what about
Bsr001_834	And and really see what you can do with a real system . ; So . ; Yeah , for example , when you go to your PDA system it 's , uh , really an awful open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns , ; That 's right .
Bsr001_1554	an and , uh ; Yeah that ; But a lot of the ; Right .
Bed015_344	Right , n s ; you may be you may not be like everyone else in in Berkeley , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1247	So the pronounceable acronyms get underscores , ; the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . ; There 're comments of four types . ; So this is a good time to introduce that .
Bro019_1256	um , ; uh , ; It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA , ; and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test ,
Bmr003_2057	I mean th ; He is . ; Absolutely . ; Well why not ?
Bmr006_859	No , no , it 's pure silence . ; Pure silence . ; It 's the control set . ; OK .
Bmr019_387	And Andre - Andreas , your your microphone 's a little bit low . ; It is ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_786	Tubingen was at least involved in putting the chunks together ; In Tub - at ; I can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place . ; oh
Bro018_966	But I I think in ; I don't know . ; I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better , ; but I think that in general it 's not that critical .
Bro017_1148	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Exactly . ; And so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed .
Bmr001_530	Yep . ; It 's mostly a question of user interface . ; How do we how do we specify which ones are on ? ; Yeah .
Bed002_123	Mm - hmm . ; You know ? ; Right . ; Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly
Bed013_261	Eva , do the math . ; Long ! ; Can't . ; Hours and hours and hours and hours .
Bed002_689	And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , " Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . " ; Sure . ; You know , because then , uh , you ; u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task .
Bmr014_411	Well that 's that 's a way that 's ; You know , the spell - check basically does that ; but but in addition ; yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .
Bed015_1376	Mm - hmm . ; And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_810	Full . ; e e We can't add anymore disks to it . ; We can increase the size of the disks that are on it , ; but that will only take us so far .
Bmr027_393	You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . ; Need to get it right . ; I mean , there 's no way to get around ; I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work
Bro003_1835	From each language to the superset , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1107	And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD . ; Because as as you 've mentioned . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bed003_427	Right ? ; Right , ; so it 's not really all of context . ; Similarly prosody is not all of prosody
Bmr012_475	I should I should say that the language model is not just Switchboard ; so that 's good . ; Although combining em worked well . ; it 's also
Bmr020_1893	Yeah . ; OK , ; alright . ; OK .
Bmr007_535	E for example . ; you know , like you you get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing ; Yes . ; Right .
Bro012_1311	You multiply them where appropriate ; and ; uh um ; I see , yeah . Mm - hmm .
Bro015_150	Well , we know most what we have to to put in in this . ; And . ; Yeah . ; So , I guess . Yeah , we m
Bmr007_771	A video , yeah . ; Think so ? ; I mean I I could tell you I mean , if I if I 'm in certain meetings I notice that there are certain people who really do eh The body language is very uh is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect . ; And And
Bmr024_599	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I see no reason not to do all of them .
Bed010_572	Right . ; Right . ; OK . ; So , i i i is German uh closer to to E uh , uh , uh , uh to E I mean uh
Btr002_2070	Mm - hmm . ; Good , thanks . ; I would leave here , ; and I would go out and do my daily business ,
Bed008_610	the user budget . ; yeah , yeah ; Well , maybe , ; I again , I d
Bro013_137	Well . ; But but having a huge ; It ; If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data .
Bro023_133	Is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? ; Or twelve seconds of speech ? ; Of of speech . ; OK .
Buw001_1972	It relates to data data collection ; and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of ; um , so , ; um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened .
Bmr010_1050	They would be so s so terrific . ; Right ? ; I mean , this was something that we were talking about . ; We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times .
Bmr003_583	As a pilot study . ; and ; Yourself ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_860	Or or ; Uh , no , actually , get we need another box . ; Because each each box in the back room can only take six . ; Oh , to get r to get rid of the wired things .
Btr002_3180	I would keep " er " . ; Well , " E " " er " " er " if it 's a filler . ; Oh , you would keep " er " . ; So , " I mean , er , "
Bro024_306	Yeah . ; within phone call , ; if it 's a dialogue system , it 's within whatever this characteristic you 're trying to get rid of is expected to be consistent over , ; Hmm .
Bed011_1015	Well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust . ; But it 's not popular it 's only p only ; Right , Right . ; Existence proof , you know .
Bed013_1233	it is a question . ; It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X , ; and X is that location . ; There 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that .
Bmr009_1137	You know am I speaking with German accent ; Oh . ; I don't think so . ; Right .
Bmr027_738	and then they could subtract the beep out . ; Oh , yeah . ; Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ? ; Right . Exactly . I see .
Bmr025_323	but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . ; OK . ; So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , ; then we talked about um some other stuff
Bro007_226	So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ? ; Uh ; I don't remember . ; Um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets
Bmr018_1256	So I 'm not saying anything about bias towards small headsize , ; About heads ? ; but does seem , uh ; It would be an advantage .
Bed009_890	OK . ; I see . ; So , but ; So y you just connect to the lexicon
Bmr031_1417	they found a particular set of parameters they liked this week . ; And we 're running with that for a while . ; But . ; OK .
Bmr018_540	Yeah , it could be faster , ; but , you know , I mean , th in the ideal world ; What ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_374	i it 's all compromised , ; right , ; so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . ; But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .
Bns001_1293	So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with . ; I always say that the success of internet make it unflexible . ; It 's impossible to change something very easy . s ; s
Bro012_727	Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies . ; But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way . ; The reason I put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different . ; Uh . And so I thought " Oh , this is good . "
Bmr019_1626	but the other one that you did , ; the NSA one , ; which we hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1403	so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve . ; You know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? ; And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise ; and
Bro005_1185	But Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean i i e The um I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA ,
Bed011_337	and like , " alright , well , let 's start here . " ; Um . So I haven't really gone into the , you know looked at all of the stuff that 's going on . ; So I don't really ; Right , I mean , once I start doing that I 'll have more to say about this kind of thing .
Bns001_1308	and focus really on the reasonable size of the project ; maybe in the first stage fo for the NSA core itself , ; and maybe possible extension from , for instance , if KPN say " yes , that 's great , " ; " that 's the right direction .
Bro018_864	I mean again the Cambridge folk found the PLP actually to be a little better . ; Right . ; Uh So it 's um ; I mean the other thing I wonder about was whether there was something just in the the bootstrapping of their system which was based on
Bed008_1042	OK . ; Yeah . ; But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_915	Mm - hmm . ; So , um , in PLP ; There was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it ? ; No . It 's just , it it 's it 's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .
Bmr016_844	It was a spare that Dave had around ; Oh OK . ; Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . ; Oh I see .
Bro028_1178	uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes . ; And maybe maybe some , uh , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um , that the neural net learns . ; Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1645	I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . ; We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case . ; And it and it may very well be I mean , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . ; Yeah .
Bro025_518	But Mm - hmm . ; Uh , I didn't do much more for noise estimation . I just tried this , ; and ; Hmm . Yeah . Well , it 's not surprising it 'd be worse the first time .
Bed006_478	I I it even though the generator is a little bit more complex ; and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words , ; OK . ; but it would have been
Bed009_277	I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of can ; Well it 's supposed to do . ; Mmm . ; Yeah
Bmr016_1915	On the glosses for numbers , ; Yeah . ; it seems like there are lots of different ways it 's being done . ; OK .
Bmr006_1474	Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . ; But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . ; Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . ; Well , should I I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time .
Bmr028_835	Mm - hmm . ; but , you know , we we just don't know how terrible . ; Ye - It 's also an interesting problem to come up with the reference . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_397	So then , in any case , um ; But paying a lit ; You know , if i if it 's uh ; Probably for university , it 's it 's gonna be real cheap anyway .
Bro014_420	Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ? ; On what kind of roads ? ; Mm - hmm . ; With what passing you ?
Bro013_513	And this is more or less like this . ; But I meant to have see @ @ two two the picture . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1522	Right . ; because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different . ; Right . ; But , it 's it 's that 's probably not it .
Bmr015_849	as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy . ; And , um , if it 's voiced , ; I guess so so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . ; But if it 's voiced ,
Bmr029_484	So if you get some cross - talk from another microphone , then you just process this it as if it were from that speaker . ; The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both . ; Well , that 's more of a problem . ; I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of gene
Bmr008_645	Mm - hmm . ; And in terms of the more open ones , we have the we 're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who will be participating in the meeting data . ; We can find it We can resolve certain issues later , if ; Mmm .
Bmr005_26	Tran ; Oh sorry , go ahead . ; So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project . ; OK .
Bmr015_495	maybe another will end up . ; Yep . ; Actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that ; guy , uh ,
Bns002_1344	So ; One possible extension of the same idea and something uh I 've been thinking for awhile , is the idea that , well , why can't do we extend this same concept to cell array systems ? ; Why can't we , for example , think about some mmm , new mechanisms that users could get , uh connectivity by means of other users , and no directly to the base station , ; or , when we have several technologies uh in overlapped in a certain area , why can't we use the closest and the cheapest , maybe , technology ,
Bmr027_913	Oh . Oh , OK . ; So . Tha - that was my intention . ; So this time was just the first chunk . OK . ; It 's just
Bmr006_1094	Interesting . ; This ; Hmm . ; Sorry .
Btr002_1632	Like , those groups ? ; It whichever . ; I that way ; or or a nature of a meeting ,
Bmr012_1317	and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing ; and then um the third part would ; and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST ; and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards
Bmr024_891	Or from being read and read ? ; No . ; Read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them . ; Oh , OK .
Bed008_601	Now but the now so so but then the question is ; uh ; so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , ; but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .
Bro017_1289	Yeah , on Intel architecture , may not run in SUN . ; I 'm ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1289	OK . ; I mean You know of course , Rosaria 's pursuing this this area ; Mm - hmm . ; but I really do think from everything that I 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying ,
Bro021_130	And then it was something about , uh , some ; and then somebody said " yeah , it does seem like , you know , C - zero is the one that 's , you know , the major one " or , uh , s ; I can't remember exactly what it was now . ; Mmm .
Bmr014_479	it 's not a good way of saying ; but it 's it 's the specific uh way of stating these these letters . ; Right . ; So it sounds good .
Bmr012_1054	There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in , ; you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ? ; Becau - the reason is the only only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector . ; No I understand .
Bro019_274	Mm - hmm . ; but if you were logged into it from home ? ; and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr010_1562	So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample ; Nnn , yeah . ; and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random , ; Yeah .
Bmr012_865	Right . ; and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory , ; that 's not a problem . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1189	The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . ; OK , fair enough . ; I guess , um , I uh , what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ? ; Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing , so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le
Bed008_642	But the other thing you could do is have an ; and this will give you the flavor of the of what ; you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_206	So we took out that part of the road network as a hack ; and then it found actually the way to the entrance . ; which was now the closest point of the road network to ; Yeah .
Bdb001_439	So maybe it 's maybe oth you know , ; if if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz I don't . ; The only thing ; Yeah .
Bro022_374	Hmm . ; That 's something to think about . ; I don't know . ; I had a question about the system the SRI system .
Bmr026_826	Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh ; So . ; I I think so . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1770	Yeah , but there 's ; Cuz otherwise I was gonna say we have to cancel . ; Yeah . ; There 's tea , also , though .
Bmr031_1106	So . ; So . ; And and th that 's actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2235	or when you expect them to finish it , or ; Well partly it depends on how um , how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm ; because i this takes time , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1190	Yeah . ; Yeah , they do . ; They know very well . ; Yeah I agree I agree . I agree .
Bro028_452	and and and there 's a lot to do . ; Uh - huh , yeah . ; But I 'm I 'm just saying , at least as a thought experiment , that 's what I would wanna test . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2081	and ; So ; and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like " percent " . ; Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for " percent " ,
Bmr028_832	For the meeting ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's gonna be terrible , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_240	Yeah . ; and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , uh , non - predictable . ; Yeah . ; Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , I mean , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , uh , you know , uh , tense lax .
Bed013_485	Oh , it 's cognitive . ; OK . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Even neuro .
Bed015_2032	Yeah . ; But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro003_787	It 's , uh , French French . ; French French . ; Like Mexican Spain and Spain . ; Yeah .
Bns003_86	so I don't know what he did . ; I know in the meantime it 's running , ; Uh ! ; and I will definitely set up the next one .
Bmr015_407	Uh , I don't remember , ; but it 's pr probably along the li ; I I could be wrong on this ; yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty .
Bmr010_312	we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling ; so that we would actually have data , ; Mmm , yeah . ; but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in
Bmr009_1001	there 's no figure . ; Well . ; Well just a little ; You know , it doesn't have all the detail ,
Bmr010_1513	Or , you know , how b short should they be ? ; So , ; th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things ; Hmm .
Bro005_795	That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task ; If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . ; Mmm . ; If it uh if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance .
Bmr011_1260	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; So this is like gestural uh , these g ; Yeah , something like that . ; Right .
Bmr001_514	Do you have any idea ? ; It 's uh twenty C Ds , ; so that 's twelve gigabytes . ; So that would last us for a while .
Bro024_155	But , um , i for a demo , you won't see it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; OK .
Btr001_2038	Mm - hmm . ; And that 's the other thing , that we don't have ; someone currently doing the video thing . ; It would really be interesting .
Bmr011_440	It 's premature . ; Fine . ; Good . ; Uh , he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , uh , or he might have no interest whatsoever .
Bmr010_692	You know , if if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone . ; Right . ; So it 's it 's , uh , uh ; Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little form .
Bed013_752	Don't you need to reduce it if it 's a or reduce it , if it 's a cognitive neuro ; Well , you don't have t ; I mean the conference may be cognitive neural , ; doesn't mean that every paper has to be both .
Bns001_1328	Let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way . ; Uh let 's assume that we are successful with this proposal , ; so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do . ; So my question is , what we want to do is ?
Bmr028_999	And pick whichever 's better . ; We would actually we would run some sort of segmentation . ; Thilo 's is as good as any , probably . ; Um , and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments , to
Bmr012_641	so and and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth ; it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard ; so that 's good . ; And um let 's see
Bmr006_1745	And that violates our privacy . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_510	The p the peaks should be voiced portion . ; And this is the noise portion . ; Uh - huh . ; And this is more or less like this .
Bed010_220	we can even make a sort of an internal demo , ; and I I show you what I do , ; Mm - hmm . ; I speak into it and you hear it talk ,
Bmr005_1256	Right . ; Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . ; And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile ; so um right now
Bmr030_325	That ; No , we grabbed most of it . ; Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff . ; Ah .
Btr001_1201	OK , good . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . That 's fine . ; Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that .
Bro022_124	um , ; then ; after after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . ; Right ?
Bmr018_1065	A lot of it 's dominated by channel properties . ; th ; Exactly . ; But what you do wanna do is take the , even if it 's klugey , take the segments the synchronous segments , the ones from the HLT paper , where only that speaker was talking .
Bed014_436	I mean . ; Yeah . ; Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t ; Yeah , I have a busy weekend
Bmr013_241	and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , uh , non - predictable . ; Yeah . ; Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , I mean , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , uh , you know , uh , tense lax . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1450	Uh , no ; not yet . ; Uh , yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth ; and she said she 's interviewing two more people .
Bmr002_1148	But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table . ; Right . ; So . ; Right .
Bro003_419	well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family . ; But they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr008_277	And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that 's th the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do . ; Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse . ; That ; Right . That 's what we 've done so far .
Bro005_935	um , ; Uh - huh . ; uh , training targets ; I like that .
Bmr009_1274	Won't they answer the same thing ? ; Well they might only answer only one of the questions ; but if ; Yeah that 's fine .
Bed003_1507	and I was surprised . ; Mm - hmm . ; It was actually OK . ; You know , on Boston New York ,
Bro027_852	Yeah . ; Um ; one part that 's not . ; Right .
Bsr001_321	No . ; I 'm sorry . ; Yeah . ; Hey , whi what where are @ @ ?
Bro008_564	yeah ? ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro007_271	right . ; So these these are word error rates ; Yeah . ; so this is on how many words .
Bro024_772	So , u u ; it it seems to be the best what wh wh what what we can do in this moment is multi - condition training . ; And every when we now start introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_670	She 's already done quite a bit . ; I have a bunch of hours , ; Oh , we have . ; I 'm sorry .
Bro019_333	Well I don't know how may I how ; OK . ; Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_531	Sheep is good . ; Sounded good . ; Yeah . ; Right so um so I guess the good news is that
Buw001_1133	Yeah . ; Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? ; I mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where we are right now . ; OK .
Bro003_1796	uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . ; So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , ; take a while to develop . ; Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic .
Bro013_496	OK . ; So it 's harder to distinguish ; It 's height . ; but it but it g
Bmr028_1377	Yeah . In pattern recognition , or in ; I think . It 's really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception , ; Yeah . ; or
Bmr020_1127	the the n the backchannel will will occur at the end of of those three . ; Yes . ; And and in in the in the previous version where in the n which is used now , there , the backchannel would would be in - between there somewhere , ; I see .
Bns001_353	So uh ; this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of . ; Of course , this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches . to the w uh r uh from the zero - cost area network to to the uh um non - null cost area network . ; But maybe some users want to do this .
Bro015_230	From from eighteen to twenty , or ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So . The thing I was thinking about was uh , you know , the number of insertions really goes up when you start adding all the noise in ,
Bmr009_388	So . ; It Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings ; He 's getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again in mid - January . ; He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .
Bmr020_1465	and we 'll we 'll fix things up ; and some meetings will cost more time to fix up than others . ; We should ; Yeah .
Btr002_364	the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare ; I think , so . ; I I OK - So , in terms of like when you 're going through the Tigerfish transcripts , you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases ? ; Not this t t
Bro012_1406	which you know , is similar to the the noises found in the TI - digits um portion of Aurora . ; Yeah . ; noise , yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right , yep .
Bed008_504	what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , ; what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions ; Mm - hmm . ; and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff .
Bro016_674	Yeah . ; You know ? That 's more like looking at third formant over over a turn or something like that , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_99	You can zoom in , but not out . ; What 's a shape file ? ; The shape file is ; If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen .
Bmr030_714	Mm - hmm . ; So if you go to the speech local web page , and then there 's a disk status page . ; You can click on that ; and it 'll query Abbott ,
Bro023_608	Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? ; Hmm . ; What 's what 's the deal with that ? ; OK ,
Bro005_475	but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . ; Perhaps , yeah . ; Well , that 's that 's one thing , ; but see the other thing is that ,
Bsr001_235	That would give you a headache . ; What happened ? ; otherwise my joints here . ; I mean , depending where I put it , it press different things ,
Bro007_25	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The graph , ; yeah another one .
Bmr011_1725	he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . ; OK . ; Which uh ; I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes ,
Bed005_194	No . ; Oh . So it it doe I it These u these optional elements , ; It is not ; it 's it 's actually a set ,
Bed015_1734	And you know , you can do sort of special things . ; You can , th ; put just the phrase " I think " as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth . ; Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions
Bns001_816	We are leaving the network area . ; That 's dangerous . ; So how do you want to focus on network services . ; Cuz if you go to the app
Buw001_1579	I usually don't remember my action items . ; But I 'd I ; OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_768	So the word " well " is in this in this segment multiple times , ; and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it . ; But then that constraint of sort of uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general . ; Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint ,
Bmr013_411	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal . ; Right . ; So I think that 's sorta qualitatively different .
Bmr010_612	Add him . ; or ? ; No , I , eh , eh , p ; It it oc I h it 's
Bmr010_92	And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance . ; And for Broadcast News , that was fine . ; Here obviously it 's not . ; Yeah .
Bro017_53	because otherwise uh that that th that wasn't a correct thing . " ; And so then ev ev everybody else says " well we should we need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector , ; or we have to do something about it " . ; Right .
Bmr031_643	It 's really short , yeah . Yeah . ; Then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1753	and it didn't give you good error messages . ; Yes , this is this is it 's incredible . ; Huh . ; Hmm !
Bed015_2033	But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; So I would say in the short run we 're not gonna b
Bmr003_2092	or or ; Right . ; Well , we wanna do that definitely . ; Right .
Bro024_1482	or ? ; But , it 's after the thresholding . ; So , ; Oh ,
Bed010_242	Indeed . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Makes sense .
Bmr003_2127	Cool . ; What is ; They sorta look like this . ; Oh .
Bmr005_1207	But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea . ; OK . ; Well , if there is , anyway . ; Yeah , I was gonna mention that .
Bmr014_839	But I think it 's easier to drop in the box . ; But ; Just put the button on on the web page which say " please send me the the scripts " . ; Oh that 's interesting .
Bro028_703	I mean , they 're not used as probabilities , ; but the log probabilities ; we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities , ; and so we can model them better .
Bmr026_1241	So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , ; yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand fr
Bmr005_513	So and I I I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . ; So . ; I mean the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1055	and and ; It had additive n ; But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction . ; We were doing our funny stuff , right ?
Bmr020_242	this is way more than five percent . ; Did he mean face like face - to - face ? ; Or ? ; Well , in real conversations ,
Bmr009_667	You know , you shouldn't be more than ; like You should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel . ; Yeah . ; Then you 're gonna w have a wash .
Btr001_2752	OK , so ; Are we gonna do them together then ? ; Or no ? ; Well , I don't know ,
Bmr008_814	Mm - hmm . ; We could ask them for more information , but I don't think it 's necessary and it 's not going to solve this problem . ; I thought this was be fast . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1694	Yeah , if you can get it to ; And and ; but , I mean , this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too . ; I don't I have no idea .
Bmr031_1406	Mm - hmm . ; Um . But , um , um ; but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction ; which are , uh , sort of i can be looked at as m minor modifications of one another .
Buw001_1748	Well , or d or not even higher level , ; We were gonna ; different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . ; We 're gonna have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that .
Bns001_1125	Yeah , but I 'd rather like to follow the discussion before I gave any comments , ; cuz it 's really The first point is it 's much more than it was before I left , ; so it 's like five weeks in between , so it 's like that whew ! ; that big now .
Bro018_621	You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian mixtures for that matter are sort of fairly brute force kinds of things , where you sort of you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters ; and then you you place them as you best can to define the boundaries , ; and in fact , as you know , these things do take a lot of parameters ; and and uh if you have uh only a modest amount of data , you have trouble uh learning them .
Bro018_867	I mean the other thing I wonder about was whether there was something just in the the bootstrapping of their system which was based on ; but maybe not , since they ; Yeah see one thing that 's a little bit um ; I was looking I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created .
Buw001_1857	We don't know . ; Oh , OK . ; " Recording equipment . " ; Yeah .
Bmr001_204	Yeah . ; Well n ; Yeah . ; Jim is busy at the moment .
Bed005_390	So whatever n this does ; I mean this is , basically , looks l to me like a function call , right ? ; Hmm ? ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr006_752	But ; Sorry , sorry . ; Go ahead . ; And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify .
Bed015_624	Uh , right , right , right . ; Um , for now I 'm gonna say like " profile " 's often used ; like two uses that come to mind immediately . ; One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else .
Bro021_692	What what what ? ; Oh , yeah . ; I actually implemented the Wiener f f fil filtering as a module and then tested it out separately . ; Yeah , I see .
Bro025_620	So , right now we have , like , uh we have the cleaned - up features , ; so we can have a better VAD by training the net on the cleaned - up speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . I see .
Bmr016_2015	Yeah . ; Oh these are all these , the " NUMS point " , this all where they 're saying " point " something or other . ; These are all like inside the spontaneous ; And the other thing too is for readability of the transcript .
Bro014_167	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . In fact , you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_645	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; So you could have a k a " fit " node ; and again that would have to be computed by someone else
Bmr005_413	I consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety ; eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped . ; OK . ; This is the idea .
Bns002_273	so it is it is a problem that we have to address ; and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control . ; And , uh , ; well , some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions
Bmr008_905	That 's to handle that unusual percent or two . ; And then ; Yeah . ; And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize
Bro011_523	using TIMIT ; right , right . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_411	Hmm . ; It 's hard to find anything that you say in these . ; Yep . ; Great .
Btr002_1711	That was really a kick . ; And whistles . ; He was it I you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy , ; he was making these funky sounds
Bro021_1284	And with th with this new s new mean and variance I estimate again this . ; So you estimated , uh , f completely forgetting what you had before ? ; Um , ; Uh , or is there some adaptation ?
Bed006_129	And um ; More than three of us . ; what happened is that um , " A " , there was some confusion between you and Jerry with the that leading to your talking to Catherine Snow , ; and he was uh he he agreed completely that some something confusing happened .
Bed002_238	years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . ; Mmm . ; And um , these uh these lines are , um , paths , ; or so That 's ab er , i
Btr001_321	actually she she was in the middle phase I would say . ; We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1102	yeah that would be that would be nice . ; and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week . ; OK . ; It 's also a question of the recursiveness and and a hier hierarchy um in there .
Bro023_462	And , ; so , ; uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it ; but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , uh , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance
Bsr001_512	Uh ; I 'm actually finding this quite comfortable now that I 've got it I 've got it just right . ; That 's right . ; I 'm surviving .
Bro027_1105	Yeah . ; and ; Yeah . ; much more than that , it wasn't much better .
Bmr010_18	No . ; Well , I 'm I sent a couple of items . They 're they 're sort of practical . ; I thought somebody had . ; I don't know if you 're
Bmr006_794	So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . ; No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . ; No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying " Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? " ; Eh
Bed017_544	Mmm . Mmm . ; So there 's a lot of stuff , ; and people are looking at that . ; Most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right .
Bmr027_1233	No , no . Why don't you why don't you go ahead ; since it 's short . ; Um , well , uh . ; Oh , I thought you meant the disk space .
Bro013_392	or ; Yeah . ; You know , as long as it did the job . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1032	C they really could do phonetic transcription if if we wanted them to . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . Well Well , you know , it might be something we 'd wanna do with some , uh , s small subset of the whole thing . ; Hmm .
Bmr013_649	OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? ; Both ; both . ; OK .
Bmr009_465	And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " . ; Yeah . ; And the " mm - hmm " is really usually very low energy . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1021	Uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that . ; Uh . ; If you needed it to do that . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1233	Same with " six " . ; The " X " , well the " KS " or whatever , at the end . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro012_472	Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , ; and we go to ninety - four point O four . ; Uh - huh . ; So that 's six six point th
Bmr022_191	Oh . ; But ; So is this a ; It 's just in this case they were not .
Bro021_1042	Right . ; And then how do you go from there to the ? ; This is right . ; And then if I apply exponential , to have here E
Bro018_539	I 'm adding complexity . ; Yeah . ; Just ; You know . The idea is with a with a very simple statistical structure , could you could you uh at least verify that you 've chosen features that are sufficient .
Bmr008_144	And this particular form ; I know . ; So , this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker , ; Yeah .
Bed011_318	Yeah . ; First one wasn't very good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_261	Yeah , you have like a sanity sanity check on them . ; yeah . ; S scratch my other idea . ; It 's pretty simple ,
Bmr019_1730	because I I enjoyed @ @ very much , ; Mmm . ; uh . ; And I 'm sorry by the result of overlapping ,
Bmr005_474	Too much speech . ; Right . ; So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_29	OK well , the , w uh as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . ; The digits goes up to about four thousand . ; Um , and so , uh , we probably will be done with the TI - digits in , um , another couple weeks . um , depending on how many we read each time . ; So there were a bunch that we skipped .
Bmr018_1031	Yeah . ; but ; I mean , we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where ; I mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor .
Bdb001_284	I don't know what their structure is . ; OK . ; I 've forgot what the str ; But , wait a minute ,
Bed011_819	Yeah . ; And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say " How much cheese do you want ? " ; and they say " Ah , enough . " ; And the and the this used all over the place .
Bns002_665	Uh , if this area is bigger than what is really needed , we are , somehow , wasting a little bit of space . ; So , uh ; our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values , ; these uh the area , the covered area , for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value ,
Bed003_758	So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then " unknown " as an actual value . ; Yeah . ; What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable , ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1222	Exactly . ; But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs . ; And that 's very difficult . ; So if you have a good ,
Bmr011_1193	bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . ; Right , so I think we talking about three level three things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1052	Well , it 's probably harder , ; but I I think what I was s nnn noting just when he when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things , ; Yeah . ; because if there 's if most of the overlaps you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and and the rest of them are low ,
Bdb001_1207	Mmm . ; Something like that , ; um , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this uh , this annotation format . ; Yep .
Bed015_635	So they have to be there or expressed in some way . ; Which which I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive ; but they 're they 're different meanings . ; Right .
Bmr031_1019	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is absolutely natural meetings . ; We have absolutely no effect from our preconceptions .
Bro024_763	Mm - hmm . ; And ; Yeah , I think what you do is in when when you have the the this multi - condition training mode , um then you have then you can train models for the speech , for the words , as well as for the pauses where you really have all information about the noise available . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_306	so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . ; But , ; um Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in to people . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_144	It shur ; Unless it was in a situation . ; We 'd have to set up a situation where , it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there . ; Yeah !
Bmr015_43	and it 's all me . ; Cuz no one sent me anything else . ; Did they send , uh , the messages to you about the meeting today ? ; I have no idea
Bmr028_1075	Something . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_628	and you pick a time ; and you pick seats and all of this . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr009_1565	Or is that ; Not easily . ; I mean y yes we could do that . ; You could you can write widgets in C .
Bro023_194	I was trying twelve seconds cuz that was the best in my test before ; OK . ; and that increasing past twelve seconds didn't seem to help . ; Hmm .
Bns002_225	and uh , the arrows are representing this transmission ; and the receiving nodes , these three nodes , are receiving the transmission , ; and I 'm trying to uh show the area , the covered area , for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle . ; OK ?
Bns001_886	I think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal , ; why to switch now ? ; So I don't see the reason for that . ; Maybe the application we suggested is not the best one .
Bsr001_1353	of of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics . ; Erase that part . ; It 's not going to be natural . ; It 's not gonna be a regular meeting .
Bro019_1247	and and uh , ; I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , ; and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the FFT ; and the FFT did slightly better .
Bmr026_1103	It wasn't ? ; No . ; Really ? ; They were very close .
Bmr015_465	So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ? ; Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends , ; and Uh . ; Yeah , there there would be there would be new hires ,
Bro027_563	And there i ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta
Bmr015_1157	Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , ; as I really try to not to detect those breaths ; which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1244	Um , my project is going along ; but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress . ; Yeah . ; I don't really have anything specific to to talk about .
Bed005_1257	We know we have twenty object types ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; and we 'll write it down in a flat file .
Bed010_941	so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , ; so that that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . ; And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft . ; OK .
Bsr001_1081	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr007_400	even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . ; Yeah ? ; So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's We know that that 's wrong in real time . ; Yeah ?
Btr001_1409	and it goes over to here and stops ; and this person starts to talk ; and he goes over to here ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1563	That 's ; If there was some Is there some way to have someone write patches in something faster and and link it in , or something ? ; Or is that ; Not easily .
Bdb001_310	You do ? ; OK . ; Is there some documentation on this somewhere ? ; Yeah ,
Bro003_1131	but it 's not too much . ; It 's not too much , ; no . ; Yeah .
Buw001_908	n ; I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . ; But but having a small percentage of the data with it , ; I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not .
Bed009_240	and that you usually do inside of buildings " and so forth . ; These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved . ; And if the action planner does something with it , great . ; If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really
Bed005_1401	So , I I think we can handle that . ; And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal . ; Yeah . ; I think that 's where we have to get technically clever .
Bro017_851	Y you ca you ca Ch - Chuck , you can't do that . ; right , ; yeah , because you you have ; Wait .
Bmr018_1625	I think this would be fun to do . ; Right . ; that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , ; and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way ,
Bed010_245	Makes sense . ; But any so that e e ; It 's clear , then , I think . ; Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .
Bmr006_463	It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , ; Yep . ; but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , ; Right .
Bmr014_1038	I ; Yeah . ; Yeah , uh no that it tha ; Tha - that 's true .
Bmr013_547	Of the f acoustic features ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_332	I I kind of like this . ; Well ; OK . So , we 're assuming that ; Yeah .
Bmr002_608	Oh , EAGLES . ; Yeah , that 's the European one . ; Yeah . ; You know , I saw I know you know about the big book .
Bro016_397	Or is it just like a tech report for ICSI , ; No . ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_245	Wha - what 's TI - digits ? ; I thought t ; It 's wide - band , yeah . ; It 's in in fact , we looked it up
Bed003_1730	That 's probably a good enough test of ; Uh - huh . ; Sort of having an actively antagonistic , uh ; Yeah .
Bmr008_259	so you want Professor to be in a separate category , ; you think you think uh think think we ; So , as I said Undergrad ; I think professors probably want it
Bmr031_1377	Mm - hmm . ; So So , uh um . ; Yeah . ; Neat .
Bed011_1048	er that 's what ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK , Because uh we do wanna get them r u perfectly but I think we 're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact . ; Of course .
Bmr016_475	but the people who wanna work on it we should talk to them . ; I don't think we 're gonna collect vast amounts of data that way , ; So . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_702	he prefe he said he would prefer FTP ; but ; OK . ; and also , um , the other person that wants it There is one person at SRI who wants to look at the um , you know , the uh the data we have so far ,
Bro019_1521	So I took the um , PLP LPC coefficients and um , I found the roots . ; This was something that Stephane suggested . ; I found the roots of the um , LPC polynomial to , um , track the peaks in the , um , PLP LPC spectra . ; well there is aligned spectral pairs , is like the the
Bro014_1588	Oh , I see . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's sort of what MSG does . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_840	well , you know , there 's this issue of of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns , whatever they are . ; Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve , ; And Oh , that 's interesting . ; right ?
Buw001_2163	Exactly . ; because they found it and it exists . ; " I found this great corpora . " ; Yeah .
Bed009_597	but I I I I think it 's really really wrong headed for something that you that has a lot of state , ; it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts . ; Yeah . ; Yeah I think just the the spatial planner and the route planner
Bed015_1999	So let me ; Refer to them . ; which of you know , which are how they 're getting bound together . ; Yeah , right , right , right .
Bmr010_686	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_600	So , they 're they 're quite distinct . ; I mean , you need them both , ; but they 're quite distinct . ; And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics .
Bro010_253	but it was , ; uh , ; I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . ; Yeah ,
Bmr030_513	Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed010_239	OK . ; Well d we we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're ; Uh - huh . ; Indeed .
Btr002_3359	and of course I do my checks , ; and then I have a , um a script that I wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets , ; do a listing of them , ; Mmm .
Bed012_884	OK . ; And not meet tomorrow ? ; Sure . ; OK .
Bed011_1047	So what I yeah , OK , So what what I meant was " Do a first cut at " . ; er that 's what ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK , Because uh we do wanna get them r u perfectly but I think we 're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .
Bmr016_405	No , I 'll p ; Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , ; but then you don't get the the same effects . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1225	Yeah . ; Yeah , I I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . ; Right . ; Yeah , and Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into ,
Bmr020_1826	I it doesn't ; I don't ; Either way would be fine with me , ; I don't really care .
Bed003_575	OK . ; Dat - dat - dah . ; What should I observe ? ; Just se set a few of them .
Bmr018_1464	um , I 'm very bad at note - taking . ; But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not , ; I always write down the wrong things . ; I do take notes .
Bmr006_598	and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . ; Oh ! ; Oh . ; And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors .
Bed009_936	Oh OK , ; so it yeah , s s I thought I 'd ; Mm - hmm . ; So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the in the pattern matcher or not ?
Bmr011_1661	Not not ; Yeah . ; The Business school . ; " If you 're really angry at someone use our conference room . "
Bro011_135	I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz because um ; uh I was talking with Hynek about it later
Bmr011_1131	the one that I transcribed . ; Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? ; Um , I 'm sure I have some ; February sixteenth I think .
Bmr015_1028	Yeah . ; I y i ; I mean , breath is natural , ; but not
Bro017_672	Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power . ; You need to have a genetic algorithm , that basically tries random permutations of these things . ; I know . ; Exactly .
Bed006_818	No , no , no . ; Source is just not spelled out here . ; Oh , OK , OK . ; Source meaning Source will be uh will have a name , a type , maybe a dimensionality ,
Bro019_1628	You 're getting the Again , you 're getting sort of the , ; uh ; Mm - hmm . ; You 're getting something that is is uh , af strongly affected by the PLP model .
Bro004_601	Is that what that is ? ; It 's ; no , ; the third part ,
Bro003_1342	So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is . ; Hm - hmm . ; And so in JRASTA you attempt to do that . ; It 's a little complicated
Bmr003_1542	It was a lot funnier if you were there though . ; Uh , yeah , ; I know . ; Well , you 'll see .
Bmr022_526	It might make the transcript faster ; Yeah . ; W wel I mean I A quick conversation with Brian would be good , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_707	OK . ; Yeah . ; But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_674	Yeah , OK . ; So I just ; this XML stuff here just has to do with Source - Path - Goal type stuff , ; in terms of traveling through Heidelberg .
Bmr006_696	My my idea is to work ; I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work . uh , only just eh , six months , as you know , ; Wow ! ; but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter .
Bro007_242	So the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say ; and each sentence on the average has four or five digits ; or is it most of them longer or ; Yeah
Bmr021_515	I didn't realize that . ; OK . ; So at any rate , so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we 're gonna do and then when we 're gonna do it . ; Yeah .
Bro019_927	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and then you then then add a little bit l noise noise addition
Bmr011_1296	and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . ; Hmm . ; It 's a nice balance . ; Right . Yeah , that would be good .
Bmr009_594	That 'd be great . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; That 'd be really great .
Bro003_47	Uh I think that means the battery 's O K . ; d do you ; Let me see . ; Oh OK ,
Bro024_1161	So . ; So so what is the lower curve and the upper curve ? ; It means ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_137	D Can't you just look at one specific ; No ; Yeah , exactly . The @ @ Xerxes allows you to say , u " Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . " ; But , we don't really know what we 're interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result .
Bro018_745	or to come up with these vectors to see how closely they match the phones , ; Oh . ; Right , ; um to come up with a mapping from um MFCC 's or s some feature set , um to uh w to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature .
Bmr007_1275	Oh well . ; Yeah . ; Oh ; So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ?
Btr001_1675	Right . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_497	Right . ; Yeah . ; the problem is when you run , uh , if you run a regular dictionary , um , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , ; Yeah .
Bmr030_184	I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight . ; Hmm . ; I think he had one twenty - eight , ; Yeah , either one will work , I think .
Bro023_1728	the c the current VAD that we have was trained on , uh , t SPINE , right ? ; Italian , and TI - digits with noise and ; TI - digits . ; Uh , yeah .
Bro003_1258	You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT different SPERT boards ; and and have ten other jobs running on different computers . ; So , it 's got to take that sort of thing , ; or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these .
Bro024_316	Yeah , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Now , you know , maybe you 'd use something from the others
Bns001_166	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So ; about the projects will be something ,
Bro010_1081	We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .
Bmr001_553	Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's something that that we definitely need to look at with this . ; Maybe we shouldn't 've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try . ; Well , it 's OK ,
Bed003_337	Right . ; OK . ; so . ; I see .
Bdb001_1329	The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript , ; so how do you merge it back in ? ; I understand what you 're saying . ; Mmm .
Bro003_1540	Uh , ; are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ? ; I 'm I 've been kind of out of it . ; Yeah ,
Bmr019_434	So , I mean , it doesn't you know , it 's sit ; Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed017_536	Um , yeah . ; Uh , not not too much , ; OK . ; but uh ,
Bro019_1527	Oh , no . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you just ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1326	But can they change the words without changing the time of the word ? ; Sure . ; But they could have changed it a little . ; The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript ,
Bdb001_53	I mean , I had a web page up . ; Right . ; So , ; I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or
Bro014_624	just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And then let 's try and make everything better .
Bmr016_649	Yeah . ; Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances ; where Chuck is saying a few things inside , ; and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well
Bmr008_1386	Which is the intuition , ; Yeah . ; un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_829	oh , you 're talking about backed - up . ; I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . ; The non - backed - up , ; I haven't looked to see how much of that we have .
Bmr018_395	and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr007_1000	So . ; but , um I can imagine uh building a um model of speaker change detection that takes into account both the far - field and the uh actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th for all of the speakers . ; Yep . ; Everyone else .
Bed005_1181	Mm - hmm . ; but it 's the best one you have , ; and , so forth . ; So that , they 're good at .
Bmr014_460	but uh there are things that are not so well known , in ; or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say " nine two " or you can say " ninety - two " , ; and uh ; So how are you doing the
Bmr007_528	That is an earphone , so if you just put it so it 's on your ear . ; or ; Cuz my impression is sometimes it happens when there 's a pause , ; Yes .
Bro017_1067	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns001_940	I don't have a clue . ; I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet ; and on PS PPP over something ; and how it works like that ,
Bmr019_606	Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to eh , ; and we 've talked about this in other contexts ; we want to have the ability to feed it different features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_550	And then below that there 're subcategories , uh , that have more to do with , you know , is it , uh , simply backchannel ; Mm - hmm . ; or is it , um , someone completing someone else 's thought , ; or is it someone in introducing a new thought .
Bmr028_336	We 're all entitled to our opinions here . ; Yep . ; Um . Yeah . So it 's Yeah . I think it must be three and a half weeks . ; It 's great .
Bed006_107	we 're sticking with the term " wizard " , ; Yes . ; Yes . ; OK .
Bed017_255	Certain certain beauty in it , ; so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape . ; But , ; the um ,
Bns002_667	our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values , ; these uh the area , the covered area , for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value , ; so we can reduce the not - used space for other simultaneous transmissions . ; And this will lead us to a a better to a better network throughput , to higher number of simultaneous transmissions .
Bed014_556	And she would like to apply the ontology that is , um being crafted at EML . ; That 's not the one I sent you . ; The one I sent you was from GMD , out of a European CRUMPET . ; It was terrible .
Bmr028_55	But th but that 's that 's n ; You didn't have to change the software for that yet . ; Right ? ; Correct .
Bdb001_1137	This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length , ; overlapping with any other , uh , word uh , i segment of any length . ; And , um , ; then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel ,
Buw001_396	That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , ; Mm - hmm . ; and you want to ask questions to get more detail . ; th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant .
Bro011_380	Zzz . ; Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . ; Yeah . ; I
Buw001_2248	uh , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , ; this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes , ; and that actually may be a goal . ; So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data ,
Bmr014_1106	Sorry . ; Yeah . ; and I don't know how that works . ; i There 's something down there about " if you agree to "
Bmr003_557	And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker . ; But other people are interested in for example stress marking . ; And so Jane is doing primary stress , um , stress marks as well . ; Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do .
Bro008_298	Hmm ; Well , first , uh , to really have a look at at the speech from these databases ; because , well , we tried several thing , ; but we did not really look at what what 's happening , and where is the noise , and
Bmr023_654	Well , we don't know ; and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of ; Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ? ; Uh - huh .
Bdb001_1066	And , w uh , as I said , I what I did with this stuff I based it on theirs . ; It 's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet . ; So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . ; Mmm .
Bed013_412	Did Ben harass you ? ; OK . ; Yes . ; Good .
Bed008_844	And and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint . ; But if we do it 'll have the three values . ; Hmm ? ; It 'll have the EVA values
Bmr019_1883	That w Oh , yeah , they they might . ; It 's hard to hard to say . ; Maybe those ? ; They 're so
Bro012_223	Even tenth of a percent ? ; Yeah . ; From point ; Well , we tried we tried point one ,
Bed010_532	So ; how much is that used in German ? ; Um . The uh Well I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack . ; I mean , the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment ,
Bro028_975	and , um , some which have a lot shorter , ; and so it would be like a set of multi - scale features . ; So he 's interested in , um ; Th - this is because it 's , um there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions , um there are a lot of different possible basis functions .
Bro018_560	Um . So , support vector machines are are good with dealing with a less amount of data ; Hmm . ; and um so if you if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job in learning the the patterns . ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1228	So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? ; Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again . ; Yeah . ; u It 's short .
Bmr031_373	Uh , ; I didn't ask why . ; But it seems to me that really doesn't matter . ; If they have the disk space to do it , it seems that that is not a big deal .
Bmr015_362	Yeah , OK . ; Mmm . ; He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive ; Very very ,
Bro021_959	The the the log of X plus N is not the same as the log of E to the X plus E to the N . ; Yeah . ; But this i ; Well , I don't
Bro017_195	Hmm ! ; So . I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data . ; Oh ! ; I see .
Bro018_750	Mm - hmm . ; And um ; yeah , ; basically it 's to learn a mapping from from the MFCC 's to uh phonological features .
Bmr018_1224	Yeah . ; OK , it 's off , so you can put it on . ; I yeah , I don't want it on , ; I just I just want to , um , say what I think is a problem with this .
Bro023_1627	Yeah . ; So . ; I don't estimate the f noise on the ten frames but use his estimate . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1962	Mm - hmm . ; Superclass . ; Instead of the the the the superclass thing , ; which is to take
Bmr003_875	OK . ; And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr ; Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . ; I 'd I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect .
Bmr018_1450	and I think like when Mari and Katrin and Jeff are here it 'd be good to figure out some kinds of things that we can start doing maybe just on the transcripts ; cuz we already have ; Yeah , we do have word transcripts . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1634	I 'm wai ; Yes , it 's very bad . ; Yeah . ; Well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we 're recording , right ?
Bro024_758	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So here here I mean , I found that it 's if I changed the noise estimate I could get an improvement .
Bed011_693	So this granularity would suffice , I think w if we say the person ; probably , based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude ; wants to drive there , walk there , or use some other form of transportation . ; H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ?
Bed003_42	Well , I mean , just to ; OK . ; Introduce . ; OK .
Bmr012_550	It 's pretty good ; um so then ; Have to add PZM and so on ; And I have to try it on the far field mike
Bmr012_1012	I mean one thing is it the whole thing as I said is is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling ; so that pushes requirements up a bit ; Yeah . ; I was just wondering if if that could change .
Bed015_1816	Yeah . ; But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? ; Right . ; Right , so , uh , this this raises the question of what are our current purposes .
Bmr022_792	Mm - hmm . ; like we 're not using the lapel anymore , an and so forth . ; But ; the other stuff is just gonna some variability we 're gonna have to accept .
Bro003_294	Yeah , and perhaps , um We were thinking that perhaps the cross - language issue is not , uh , so big of a issue . ; Well , w w we perhaps we should not focus too much on that cross - language stuff . ; I mean , uh , training training a net on a language and testing a for another language . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr010_970	Um , um , the I I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us . ; They are , um , um , uh really perceptive and very , um ; and I 'm not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this . ; Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days .
Bmr018_397	Yeah . ; Right . ; and if it if it there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form . ; Right .
Bro025_78	p - p - p ; We , uh we looked at , uh ; anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback ; and , uh , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression .
Bro004_330	So these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh ; Uh , let me check . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1123	They 're just being very nice and good neighbors ; A free gift . ; Yeah . ; and
Bsr001_1806	u cuz that 's not I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_70	Otherwise you just get a heartbeats . ; Yeah . ; It 's kind of ; Oh , yeah , the element ,
Btr002_98	Now " ish " was in parentheses ; " Ish decay . " ; Yeah , what 's an " ish " ? ; Well they they they were suspicious that wasn't right ,
Bro027_95	So that 's that 's a little different than Dave thought , I think . ; But but , ; um , ; still , it 's possible that we 're getting in some more noise .
Bed008_1522	Yeah yeah . ; OK . ; OK . ; Fey , you mean .
Btr002_1160	OK . We got two votes for Linguine . ; And who would prefer Amaretto ? ; Amaretto ? ; So we got more more multi - keyboardal people ?
Bsr001_2561	No ? ; It ; For ours it will ; but we have a rear projector ,
Bed005_154	um , even if you leave out , um , all all of this . ; I see . ; Yeah . ; So it 's basically feature film and TV .
Bmr026_488	Yeah . ; Yep . ; So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . ; So there 's what
Bro024_656	Yeah . ; So we have to jiggle it somehow ? ; Yeah ; so we start with that different proto and it becomes eighty - eight ,
Bmr026_305	Mm - hmm . ; so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . ; But , ; um Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in to people .
Bmr016_1199	OK , so now . Uh and a ; We are acronym - loaded . ; Um , can I ask a question about the glossing , uh before we go on ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1774	Oh , the ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro025_75	which will also be possibly helpful . ; What did I just press here ? ; I hope this is still working . ; p - p - p
Bed002_952	It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to ; Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was . ; to to give ; Yeah ,
Bmr005_829	So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going , ; But ; uh , and ; Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it .
Bdb001_863	OK . ; Right ? ; So , as opposed to ; But this is
Bmr013_454	Mm - hmm . ; Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . ; what you gain ; Yep .
Bro018_963	But it calls RASTA with some options , ; and um ; Right . ; But I I think in
Btr001_2701	I see , ; so that 's why . ; But we converted them to this format , ; and then the idea
Bmr007_259	Because , on your surface eh a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration eh , overlapped and another very very short . ; and ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_125	And uh , ; Oh ! ; I got this mail from ; I s forwarded it to Jane as I thought being the most relevant person .
Bmr019_730	And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times . ; Sh ; And Chuck 's on the lapel here , ; and he also says " mixed "
Bed016_655	All contact . ; I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't social contact , ; whatever . ; I mean .
Bed014_280	Um . ; But c the meeting looks like it 's , it 's gonna be good . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro019_290	Yeah . Right ? ; Hmm ? ; You probably wouldn't ordinarily . ; I mean you sort of
Bns002_733	but this is not what I am doing ; and uh the kind of power control I am doing uh , um , is more or less presented here , ; and what we are doing is to transmit uh with the minimum power needed depending on the distance to the destination . ; OK ?
Bmr010_1362	No . ; No . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1593	And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a a a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , it 'll be called " slash - X - something " uh , if it 's not backed up ; and it 'll be " slash - D - something " if it is backed up . ; And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called " slash - scratch " . ; But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away .
Buw001_1165	So , up to you . ; Um , what what 's the plan for this discussion ? ; We should ; Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something ,
Bed011_460	So rather than having zoo and castle . ; And then , I mean , they could be alternate versions of the same If you wanted data on different constructions . ; They could , but i but i uh tha eh they c ; yeah , but uh but
Bro021_886	So that 's uh ; This is the noisy ; Yeah , it 's ; of the value
Bmr012_1310	um other things ; and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing ; and and uh then uh ; number two would be sort of a the the transcription process
Bro014_1450	not yet ; but I wi I will call them ; and ; OK .
Bmr008_63	I c I can insert that . ; and relevant to status . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that what I have is uh
Bed002_496	In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis . ; Anyway . ; They call it intention hypotheses . ; Right .
Bed010_460	and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . ; So uh ; but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it . ; Alright .
Bmr010_1361	Oh . Maybe m you could , you kn uh show Thilo that . ; No . ; No . ; Yeah .
Bro021_823	first place , I mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries , uh , this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things . ; I mean , how much is the poor you know , relatively , uh , unhelpful result that you 're getting in this or this or this ; is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks ; and how much of it is just due to the fact that you 're not accurately finding enough regions that that are really n noise ?
Bmr002_1309	Lea ? ; No . ; The claim that uh words that get stressed are easier to recognize . ; I see .
Bro010_1086	Right . ; So where it could help is maybe at a higher level . ; Like a understanding application . ; Right .
Bmr010_909	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; No . ; They actually are
Bsr001_436	We wanna do both . ; And ; So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything . ; Right .
Bro024_1791	Before I started working on this Aurora . ; so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1087	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That would be ft quick , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_992	Yeah . ; ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . ; You know I would think ; So for archiving , we 'll just use tape .
Bmr018_1237	Yeah . ; Then it then it falls back this way so it 's ; Well wh what it 's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown , ; and so that should be should be
Bro007_170	Well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right ? ; That 's just uh ; Yep . ; yeah ?
Bmr007_869	not ; Um I I think for , eh algorithm based on energy , eh , that um h mmm , more or less , eh , like eh eh , mmm , first sound energy detector . ; Say it again ? ; eh nnn .
Bmr025_359	um ; Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . ; Yeah def ; S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month
Bmr006_930	Mm - hmm . ; This is the the eh , first idea ; Mm - hmm . ; and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis .
Bro028_1011	So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try . ; The primary features , um , are in fact ; Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , uh , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that . ; You 've you 've got some , uh , compression .
Bmr019_1794	and we 'll get our ; Uh . ; Are we gonna do them simultaneously ; Oops .
Bmr005_410	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? ; I consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety
Bro012_893	But after you do this , after you do the variance normalization ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean . ; I don't know , it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with .
Bmr008_602	Yeah but that but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are . ; um , Right ? ; I don't know ; later on , if if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said you know area then that 'll have to become your category .
Bro015_80	Yeah there is no surpri there is no surprise . ; Well , so there is nor significant improvement . ; Um . Yeah , basically that 's all . ; We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work so we 've not much more results .
Bro007_604	OK ; well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat ; and uh ; we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh
Buw001_768	Well ; That would be an interes Bu ; Well , there 's that 'd be the the parallel , yeah . ; Great idea .
Bmr031_1465	and also things like repeats for the same information , and so forth . ; And I 've been coordinating a little bit with Katrin at , uh , UW who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting . ; So there 's some overlap there in what you m ; there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration .
Bmr005_71	Uh , wh why don't ; Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly ; so why don't you you start with that . ; OK .
Bmr002_988	Oh yeah . ; OK , So , so , it 's called " Transcriber " you said ? ; OK . ; gacks
Bmr026_705	I You know , I I 've heard some comments about like this . ; That m could be . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean the
Bns001_740	Right , ; but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different . ; The picture I have in mind concerning UMTS is , first of all , if you use UMTS only for voice , Like you did it or are doing now for GSM , it 's not worth to have this kind of network . ; And , currently in Europe , where it will be deployed first , I believe , it will be very hard , in principle , to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice .
Bmr012_153	Thank you . ; So uh ; OK so should we do agenda items ? ; Uh oh that 's a good idea .
Bro016_1068	There 's , um in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between , um , acoustic features and acoustic events . ; And I think of acoustic features as being , um , things that linguists talk about , ; like , um ; So , stuff that 's not based on data .
Bed005_264	but we 'll get to that in a second . ; p ; And so this means , um , ; Oh .
Bro028_837	Hmm . ; so if it gets too low you don't don't do it . ; Hmm . ; And they they claimed very nice results ,
Bed003_1665	But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore . ; Is that the deal ? ; Yep . ; Ah , interesting .
Bmr005_1415	uh Jerry was open to it but I I s ; One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . ; You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained . ; Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .
Bsr001_986	At the same time . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; and you 're only able to hear um , parts of the weaker voice . ; And , you know , that 's It 's a style .
Bro021_452	Mm - hmm . ; You know , ; always for the matched condition , you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than C - zero . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_198	What is it ? ; So I think uh , Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked , ; M - one - hundred . ; which is these they 're listening to it and so they write something down , and let 's say they miss it , they rewind .
Bed005_443	Right . ; " Confirm Goodbye " . ; Right there . ; Yep .
Bro019_498	Mm - hmm . ; And ; So , I 've been actually running some s ; So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab .
Bro027_426	Before it was just P L ; So . ; Yeah , it was actually ; No .
Bmr018_721	c High correlation . ; And , you know , that pointed out some differences , ; so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward . ; If it were straight - forward then we would try it ,
Bmr005_254	OK , well , individuals being identified , ; let 's say you have a a snippet that says , " Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . " ; Now I mean , we 're we 're gonna be careful not to have the " wrongheaded " part in there , ; but but you know , let 's say we say , you know , " Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . " or whatever .
Bed005_87	In this case , it doesn't really make sense . ; Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying " I don't want to see the final transcript " . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if they don't If they say " no , I 'm not willing to sign that " , then we 'll show them the final transcript .
Bed013_585	I mean it 's still it 's still ; I do I don't They don't want any ; They don't have a TeX f style @ @ guide . ; Uh - huh , uh - huh .
Bro010_782	Does France Telecom do this ; It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , ; and ; Hmm .
Bro010_871	like " I 'm going to look for this particular feature ; or I 'm going to look at this frequency , " ; or ; What what what are they looking at ?
Btr002_3187	Right . Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; Oh yeah . ; But if it 's p uh , part on these little fragments , no .
Bed004_766	So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . ; And that uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting , ; so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it . ; And I don't yet see how that goes .
Bmr029_373	Um , I I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do , ; but I sort of regard it as secondary . ; OK . So , we 'll save that . ; So if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for other things to finish , then sure .
Bro014_226	Was was was Hynek involved ; or was it Sunil ; I have no idea . ; or ?
Bmr010_544	The ? ; Yes , exactly . ; Yeah ? Yeah . ; That hasn't changed .
Bed015_1408	And w you 're that 's not just a fact about France . ; Right , right . ; You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U S . Right ? ; Right .
Bro024_1873	Yeah . ; It 's it 's not the clean LDA . ; Um ; It 's In in the front sheet , I have like like the summary .
Bmr008_1558	it just finds the pi it just finds the pitch even when it 's unvoiced ? ; I mean , it must have some It has to tell you something , ; eh , I I ; It has to tell you .
Bdb001_818	That 's right . ; That 's true . ; That 's why I was trying to figure out what 's the best format for this representation . ; Yep .
Bro021_104	And then this time constant increases ; and I have a threshold that ; Mm - hmm . ; well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when if the utterance is , uh , long enough to to continue to adapt after , like , one second
Bmr002_1417	And I realize now that you have volume uh control . ; But uh ; Yeah . ; I don't feel like you 're speaking unnaturally quietly .
Bro003_1459	And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; OK ,
Bed002_1060	and we have some some data that 's loose , ; we can use our own intuition , ; and see how hard it is , ; and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need .
Btr002_3134	If it 's " mmm " , I can tell it 's ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed010_367	Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . ; OK ? ; OK . ; So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint .
Bro005_338	Mm - hmm . ; Um and we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . ; Yeah ; And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things .
Bmr016_1197	Yes . Uh - huh , yeah . ; Whew ! ; OK , so now . Uh and a ; We are acronym - loaded .
Btr002_2416	OK . OK . OK . ; Yeah . OK , I know who you 're talking about . ; But this is somebody somebody differ ; He must do this in a lot of meetings
Bed010_82	because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we 're doing it via mouse , ; but the whole system was designed to work with this thing
Bmr028_973	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . And then put it in correctly and see how much that helps . ; Yeah .
Bro004_261	Hmm . ; No , actually it 's interesting . ; So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different . ; It 's when you went to these
Bmr031_1473	so he can talk about that . ; It 's a feature we haven't used before . ; Um , and starting to , uh , r r take information from alignments ; and create a database that we can use sort of as a a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees ,
Btr001_1288	OK . ; Hmm . ; Um , like from start to finish , ; I don't know if I did one .
Bro019_587	Yeah . ; Af - I after that I added on - line normalization , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_953	Yeah , yeah . ; That 's a major that 's like , one of the two things that ; I mean , there 's gonna there 's gonna be in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's it 's gonna be a bit of a problem ; OK .
Buw001_2182	Yeah . ; Just wanted to know . ; So , seems like we 're winding down . ; Right ?
Bro017_665	Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters . ; Mm - hmm . ; The only of course problem is that there 's an infinite number of combinations ; Oh .
Bro025_612	Oh , yeah . Hmm . ; Oh , you 're talking about the VAD net . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_353	Uh - huh . ; Huh . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_925	so that it 's irrelevant . ; Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . ; We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L ; but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,
Bmr010_1072	Mm - hmm . ; But anyway , I 'm I 'm open to c our consideration . ; That 'd be great . ; I I don't wanna say that by fiat .
Bro018_432	not just speech . ; Uh . ; But I think for for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um I think that ICSLP and Eurospeech are much more targeted . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_1030	On the other hand I have to have , you know , ; there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like " Get " plus path expression for , you know , " how d ho how do I get there ? " , ; Mm - hmm . ; " How do I get in ? " ,
Buw001_812	Well , I think for I mean , for our purposes we probably will d ; I 'm not sure . ; we we might try that some ; and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that ,
Bmr005_1461	even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual ; n Well ; No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . ; I 'm talking about new ones
Bmr022_1225	Well It 's sort of not really a question about permissions , ; but more of procedure . ; Either those all go through Jane , or through someone , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1708	Anyway . ; Anyway , ; Shall we read some digits ? ; tea is tea is , uh , starting .
Bed005_556	Yeah . ; Once we 've eh We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . ; Exactly . ; Good .
Bmr005_519	you have to to analyze ; you have to to process . ; Because I I found a difference . ; Yeah , well , just I mean , just in that that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago ,
Bed012_553	" OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which decision nodes do I query ? " ; Yeah . So you have to make ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr012_890	And that 's actually said in your meeting , ; so ; Hmm . ; Oh OK .
Bmr012_237	The the glitch ; So so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to ; And the only glitch ; yeah .
Bro024_202	I mean , it it is getting a little away from reverberation . ; Um , yeah . ; It 's just that you 're making a choice ; uh , I was thinking more from the system aspect , if you 're making a choice for SmartKom , that that that it might be that it 's it c the optimal number could be different , depending on
Buw001_1091	Can we turn that light off ? ; uh ; If can we turn that just that that let ; Uh , let the record show the light is flickering .
Bns002_9	Uh , today we will have a talk from Miguel Sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad - hoc networks . ; We have here a guest , a former ICSI member of the NSA group , Jordi Domingo Pasqual . ; He is , uh , assistant professor at UPC . ; And maybe Jordi , you have a few words concerning your work
Bns002_450	all unicast packets . ; but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination . ; Yeah . ; That that true .
Bro012_407	Mmm , yeah . ; Mmm , yeah . ; It 's ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_403	Oh . I 'm sorry . ; OK . So . This is minutes taking minutes as we go , ; in his in his own way . ; Yep .
Bmr030_443	hit record , ; on the tape deck , ; Yeah . ; and just do it all all uh , analog .
Bro025_163	w which we sort of were before ; but we were considerably far behind . ; And the thing is , this doesn't have neural net in yet for instance . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2802	but in n you know , normal one - on - one speech I I think I tend to try to enunciate more . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Cuz I 've been told I mumble . ; Oh ! Huh !
Bro027_1417	It 's ; I g ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_533	And you don't you there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? " ; So ; So I think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign I I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says " OK , from now on you know , now that I 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1426	Yeah , and I have nothing to do this weekend but work . ; Why don't ; No , that 's not really true , ; but like
Bed014_734	Yep . ; Hmm . ; So . ; But , we 'll
Bro014_56	Yeah . ; Uh , ; maybe I should write it on the board . ; So , there 's four rounds of training .
Bro010_81	uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; I
Bmr008_1245	what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this ? ; Will Will somebody go back and fill that in , or we just won't have it , or ; Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway . ; So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it .
Btr002_2600	It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know . ; " Ho - ho - ho " ? ; and ; Oh , that is too much fun .
Buw001_1919	Yeah ! ; Absolutely . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Sure .
Bmr014_58	Oh , OK . ; Well maybe ; Then we don't really have to talk about that as an ; I I take that off the agenda .
Bed012_787	Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is ; I don't get it . ; I don't u understand . ; Um .
Bmr020_450	Um ; Hmm ? ; U upper lower case or no ? ; No ,
Bro005_611	Yeah , try all these different tests . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1762	Well , the other thing too is , I mean , i if if you have the equipment then , i i it could be different . ; Um . ; But I mean , i i ; Yeah ,
Btr001_1910	I 've never gotten to see her . ; Nn - mm . ; Oh , she 's here . ; I haven't seen most of them .
Bmr003_1324	eh ; I 've been exchanging emails on various issues . ; Oh , really ? ; Oh .
Buw001_1796	in order to get some realistic users . ; So if you could ask other people to call and use our system , that 'd be good . ; Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , ; Yeah .
Bmr030_621	Are How big are these files that we send to Brian ? ; Uh , pfff ! ; Half a gig . ; Really ?
Bmr025_992	That reminded me of something . ; Oh well , ; too late . ; It slipped out .
Bmr009_277	Mm - hmm . ; and eh come with another speaker with high energy ; Mm - hmm . ; and the overlapping zone has eh less energy .
Bmr002_768	Is that free ? ; I don't know . ; Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things . ; What they 're doing is trying to bring together
Bmr011_684	Hmm . ; So there 's not enough interest to overcome all of ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . Internally ,
Bmr019_879	Right . ; Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words , ; Mm - hmm . ; you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time ,
Bro022_254	I g think we never have . ; I think it 's I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T ; Hmm ! ; something like that ?
Bro014_478	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , I 'd almost argue for weighting that highest . ; But the way they have it now , it 's I guess it 's it 's
Bed015_611	And , um I mean , you 're you 're the linguist ; but , uh , it seems to me that th these we we you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , I mean
Bed011_662	Socializing , I guess . ; No , I I ; well , I dunno . ; Let Let well , we 'll put it somewhere ,
Bro013_470	None of these axes are labeled , ; so I don't know what this ; What 's this axis ? ; Uh this is uh this axis is nnn , " frame " .
Bed012_770	and get stuff out of it , ; and then hook it up to some fake construction parser ; and ; That you will have in about nine months or so .
Bmr020_1273	On that meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; So far we haven't . ; So this is not gonna be a major part of the process ,
Bmr029_680	Well , once we have the new , uh ; Well , once I do that , uh , second experiment , we 'll have the , um , files , ; and I can give you those to to process . ; OK .
Btr001_933	Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; and then " PRN " , ; And then in the brackets , what it ; how it 's pronounced .
Bmr005_711	Oh , ; yeah . ; Yeah OK . ; Sure .
Bmr010_639	I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date ; but some of it 's still the same . ; So ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_629	Right . ; Cuz people are swamped . ; But ; And actually ,
Bmr022_94	And they just filled it in . ; How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ? ; It was like a hundred twenty , ; and they had a hundred twenty - three or something like that .
Bed008_1380	so ; you have a new thing called " H " , ; OK ? ; This is a hidden variable .
Bmr010_931	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; it didn't work as well . So . ; Huh .
Bsr001_935	Yeah . ; I notice that they they s they sa have some help with control of what person to pick up . ; Mixing , ; yeah .
Bmr014_1025	right ? ; Yeah that 's true . ; of and ; " If you agree to participate you 'll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised , which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . "
Bmr019_544	It 'll be less good for some people than for other , ; but I I 'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on . ; Actually ; I sh actually should 've picked a different one ,
Bed014_1454	Uh - huh . ; Oh , definitely . They have , like , places instead of like Yeah , instead of karaoke bars now that have , like , DDR , ; like ; Yeah , yeah , I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend , who 's like " Oh , well , I can bring over the DDR if you want . "
Bmr014_147	Another wireless setup . ; I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired . ; So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? ; Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together
Bmr018_1028	And and so I 'm hopeful that that 's possible . ; I know that there 's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes , ; There 's ; Yeah .
Btr002_1326	but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them , ; Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_1085	Right ? ; Yeah . ; And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now . ; OK .
Bmr028_586	Mmm . ; or language modeling . ; I think two seconds mmm ; I don't know .
Btr002_225	Right . ; Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance . ; Like it 's not connected . ; Right . And and it just seems to sotal totally that that 's not the meaning .
Bns001_1678	Of course you have IP in the mobile device ; but if you see the strange protocols text ; there 's IP over IP and tunnels and and whatever , ; so , but it 's uh looks very strange to me
Bmr024_1070	Right . ; Oh . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bns003_167	Ah , the messages . ; Oh . ; And now we are , in principle , in the state we have to do it with a project area . ; But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested .
Bro022_796	And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want ; to find a ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us .
Bro016_228	the whole problem with insertions was what I think , um , we talked about when the guy from OGI came down that one time ; and ; and that was when people were saying , well we should have a , uh , uh , voice activity detector ; Right .
Bed006_1805	Um I can e I can uh I 'll transcribe it though . ; I take that back then . ; It 's no problem . ; OK , well don't don't make it a high priority
Bro004_987	I think ; yeah , ; we don't know ; I see .
Btr001_317	I don't know if I have . ; I suspect you haven't ; because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1107	Oh , you already got some . ; Uh , under the communicator project . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr018_848	I mean , ; yeah it 's ; If you had a if you had a s if you had a script which would ; I 've thought about this ,
Btr002_803	T Yeah . ; and , you know , press the button and " juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh " . ; Hmm . ; Cuz if you miss something and you wanna go back to it , it 's such a such a hassle .
Bmr019_1684	Or at least you can get clues to it . ; Interesting . ; I guess it does w ; So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals , like what you have .
Bmr018_572	Well , Morgan and I were were having a debate about that . ; Whereas I think it it 's probably something pathologic ; and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that . ; He s he did the Aurora system
Bmr020_1601	so but I think that 's n that really doesn't happen very often that that that a word is cut in the middle or something . ; That 's that 's really not not normal . ; So so what you 're saying is that nearly always what happens when there 's a problem is that is that uh , there 's some uh , uh nonspeech that uh that is b interpreted as speech . ; That is marked as speech .
Bed005_658	Uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end . ; But for the moment just uh , t for this class of of things , we might want to try to encompass . ; And ; Then the scope of this is beyond Approach and Vis - or Vista .
Bed003_853	What does it mean , then , that we have to ; we have an object type statue . ; That really is an object type . ; Right .
Bro003_1798	take a while to develop . ; Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . ; I mean , one I think one of the a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . ; Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes .
Bmr019_59	No . ; But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something . ; No , actually I I have to I have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places . ; Right ?
Bmr021_695	Yeah . ; I had i to install it , yeah . ; Huh . Yeah . ; Uh
Bmr026_143	The back - end stuff is working out fine . ; It 's more or less ready to go . ; I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera ; and also by the user ID .
Bmr024_493	But ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro004_1289	So I think that 's that 's pretty good . ; Um I don't know what the ; One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much , uh things could be helped by more parameters . ; And uh And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have , in terms of the uh computational limits .
Bmr024_597	No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? ; We wer we just wanted to do ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1717	Something like that is my final vision . ; Like like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM - WDM . ; Mm - hmm . ; This gets rid of the SDH .
Bed010_542	Mm - hmm . ; And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions . ; Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , ; so how how ,
Bro005_693	two thousand . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Ah , yes .
Bro027_1730	You could feed it into the neural net . ; The other thing you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bmr022_930	I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here . ; There 's another kind which s goes in your ear ; Huh . ; and it hangs down .
Bro013_567	um ; there 's uh ; I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ? ; I mean with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the
Bro004_262	No , actually it 's interesting . ; So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different . ; It 's when you went to these ; So what 's the difference between two and three ?
Bed012_632	You added a bunch of nodes , for ? ; Yep . ; OK . ; We we we have Actually what we have is this line .
Bed012_412	Um , I mean , are you saying that , what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation , or are we just dealing with arbitrary language ? ; We ; Is that your point ? ; Well , no . I I guess my question is , Is the reason that we can make a node f
Bed006_1422	we know to look for an SPG schema and put the appropriate fill in the appropriate roles later on . ; Mm - hmm . ; And you could have also indicated that by saying " Enter , what are the kinds of action I am ? " ; Yeah .
Bmr014_577	There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro010_719	Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme ; Yeah . ; But but ; A dictionary .
Bed012_866	Well , it 's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; As long as that 's O K .
Bmr010_1009	That one , I think we you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant . ; OK . ; But I told them if if there 's an obvious speech error , uh , like I said in one thing , ; Yes .
Bmr009_102	PDF ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1068	I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , ; Mm - hmm . ; so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . ; And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff
Buw001_1137	They 're the expert ; Mari ? ; Yeah ? ; Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up .
Bsr001_2075	Right . ; I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_180	I It was the network network services group . ; OK . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1050	No , no , no . ; Um , you need a task to really , you know , improve your system for that particular environment . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1571	Yeah . ; Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , ; and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . " ; So . Which , I mean , n
Bro012_899	well , because you clearly see where speech is . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer .
Btr002_1821	or sort of a mock - this or mock - that , ; Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1443	but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Non - canonical .
Bmr030_624	Really ? ; That big ? ; Oh , no , wait . ; I thought it was , like , a hundred megs .
Bed008_1486	can you bring up the function thing ? ; Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of ; That 's on the added variable , ; isn't it ?
Bmr003_1767	But other people have other interests . ; But it it does feel it does feel like it 's really in there . ; So . ; I you know I did this I did this transcription
Btr001_1777	yeah , " I guess I 'll laugh cuz everyone else is laughing , " ; I You know , who knows , but ; but yeah . ; Have you noticed that Tiger
Bro023_1536	Yeah , ; yeah . ; Um , ; actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , um , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , uh , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , uh , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha uh , correctly separated .
Bmr006_872	Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . ; Yeah . ; But steady - state noises are part of the background . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_133	It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . ; so ; Yeah , yeah . ; Right .
Bmr024_524	So , Rob Porzel ; eh , Porzel ? ; and the , uh Porzel and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues . ; Porzel .
Bmr015_738	the X - the frequency " X " , eh , using the in the instantaneous frequency , ; you can find , eh , how , eh , in several frequencies that proba probably the the harmonics , eh , ; Uh - huh . ; the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic
Bro014_788	Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay . ; Then we tried , um , to do something like proposal - two ; but having , um , e using also MSG features . ; So there is this KLT part , which use just the standard features ,
Bmr031_1070	Um . ; u Do you take do you take feature requests ? ; Cool . ; Great . Great .
Bro019_418	oh yeah ; So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement . ; The the other thing what I tried was the adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline ; and that itself gives like twenty - two percent
Bro005_754	But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . ; Maybe , may ; Uh . Are your results are still with the bad the bad ; No ?
Bed006_1438	Mm - hmm . ; mainly meaning from the natural language understanding , or from the deep language understanding to the action planner . ; Mm - hmm . ; Now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back ,
Bdb001_564	And then we have the aligned channels , of course , ; Right . ; and ; It seems to me you want to keep the frame - level stuff separate .
Bro023_226	I mean it should have some policy like that anyway . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and , uh , ; uh , in any event they might ask a second question .
Bro003_1249	and they found that the SPERT board 's still still faster . ; And the benefits is that , you know , you run out of SPERT and then you can do other things on your your computer , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_391	So what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and ; in particular ; so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling ; Accessibility .
Btr002_2609	I noticed , i m as far as problems with laughs , is that a lot of them were marked as breaths . ; W we ; Because a lot of people , ; Yes .
Bro005_453	Uh - huh . ; Because we have eighty - eight point six . ; And even the MLP alone ; What gives the MLP alone ?
Btr001_124	Yeah . ; Even though I still don't know what they are . ; I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort , ; but that 's all .
Bed008_1131	but not f but not for ; Yeah . ; the other one 's three values for endpoint already . ; Yeah , I mean you need actually three to the five
Bed016_1106	I love Van Gogh . ; Yeah . ; Ah ! ; " I wanna go see the Van Gogh . "
Bed016_701	uh wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff , ; as well as , mappings ? ; Right right r ; w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something
Bro003_1479	And I think you sent an email about , um , e scratch space for for people to work on . ; And I know that , uh , Stephane 's working from an NT machine , ; so his his home directory exists somewhere else . ; His his stuff is somewhere else ,
Bmr020_264	Yeah , I was gonna ask that too . ; Well it 's time . ; Yeah . ; Exactly .
Bmr015_424	I mean ; we 'll find out one way or another . ; Yeah . ; I mean last time I think they just had two categories ,
Bro017_363	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band . ; Hmm .
Bmr021_675	this is the Channeltrans , ; right ? ; Yeah , it 's the Channeltrans , ; Yeah .
Bro023_705	Oh , OK . ; So I picked up ; So you 're sort of trying @ @ them all . ; Y Yeah ,
Bro011_389	Yeah . ; OK . ; Hmm ! ; There 's a bunch of data that l around ,
Bmr024_1294	But that 's beside the point . ; We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features . ; Right . ; I 'm just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard features ,
Bro014_764	So ; well , is it ; OK . ; So that 's that 's all fine .
Btr002_690	Hmm . ; i in al an uh an irrelevant non - wanted artifact . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Buw001_2051	Yeah , I think that 's always desired . ; I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1362	Are Are the things in the ; I don't normalicized eh in these er experiments . by the moment . ; I don't normalicize . ; OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help .
Bro008_17	other than the the ICSI OGI one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh yeah . ; So um , I wan wanna wanna see what that is .
Bmr018_566	and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen . ; Oh , I haven't I haven't listened to them either , ; I was going to do that this afternoon . ; but there must be something wrong ,
Bed014_599	Yeah . ; You could do that . ; Um . ; But here 's here 's a way
Bed016_798	right ? ; so if the film left , ; you know state is being near film . ; So running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere .
Bmr023_308	I mean in particular I would I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_283	Just from word choice ? ; and ; Right . ; So y So , I don't think you 're talking the way you write , in in other words .
Bsr001_2398	but don't use it in your training . ; Your your junk is our , uh , training data . ; Treat especially ; Mmm .
Bns003_669	even later if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on , ; well I I will be able to to do some work from Spain too . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , that 's my future uh forecast .
Bed008_1297	right ? ; So those are the two things that we uh need . ; Hmm . ; So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting
Bmr009_601	uh uh ; like probably , if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , he we 're not paying him the full RA - ship for all the time .
Bns002_1443	because if you have settled everything , and discussed everything and and and and uh without any money in the background , and a lot of money in the background , ; that is not uh feasible from my point of view . ; Nevertheless , I discussed , with a lot of partners , these things . ; And today , uh Michael and me , we were on the UCB to discuss with a guy who is a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff .
Bsr001_1626	Yeah , definitely . ; You p you plan to to train actually models based on this data . ; Mmm . ; That 's good .
Bns001_1490	Hmm - hmm . ; The problem is which I see is that it could be fruitful to standardization ; that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers . ; But there 's not a real product like you say .
Bmr019_1504	because it 's sort of a you know , it doesn't take weeks to train it . ; Right . ; Um . ; And got some very impressive results , um , with , you know , discriminative , uh , Gaussian training . Um , you know , like , um , error rates go from I don't know , in very noisy environment , like from ,
Bdb001_639	So ; I think that should be possible as long as the ; But , uh , what I don't understand is where the where in this type of file that would be expressed . ; Right .
Bro022_23	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Yeah . ; So we probably should wait for him to come before we do his .
Bro012_304	Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state . ; Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have ; uh ; Yeah , easily four times as many parameters .
Btr001_585	Well could you ? ; Did we didn't do that very much . ; You couldn't visually isolate it ? ; What ?
Bmr027_1441	I wasn't here last week . ; Oh ! ; Sorry . ; Oh .
Bed004_295	and where the pieces are and stuff like that . ; Yep . ; Is is this make sense to everybody ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_1467	Um , yep . ; Uh , and another thing is to ; Yeah , ; for this I just use as noise estimate the mean , uh , spectrum of the first twenty frames of each utterance .
Bed006_164	And ; Yep . ; OK . ; Wonderful .
Bmr008_1000	So , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I 'm I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1082	Right . ; Although , I mean we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . ; Uh . ; Which I 've never figured out .
Bmr008_1174	right ? ; Right . ; You 're you 're you 're actually leading the meeting for the most part , most of this meeting , ; Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn .
Btr002_1324	Oh wow . ; Oh . ; but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them , ; Yeah .
Bro019_409	But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So , it 's still not
Bmr019_1117	And that 's I mean , I I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff , ; I would jus ; because I because I looked up in some books and I found OK , I wanna find a spurt in which ; Ah , right !
Bro008_334	So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh ; And and a and and also , um part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , um a realistic almost realistic database . ; I mean , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something , ; but but , uh , within the artificial setup , it isn't noise artificially added , you know , simulated , uh , additive noise .
Bmr028_1525	Interesting . ; And so it was we had a couple papers like " Towards increasing the error rate in speech " and and so on . ; Hmm . ; Huh !
Bmr002_1235	Um . ; Who , Eric ? ; Oh , he 's not ? ; No .
Bro028_1179	And maybe maybe some , uh , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um , that the neural net learns . ; Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ? ; Yeah . ; So , it seems to me that , you know , if you take away the the the difference of this primary features , and , say , you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use P - RASTA - PLP or something for the the primary features , um , then this feature discovery , uh , uh , thing is just what he 's talking about doing , too ,
Bro004_1232	Well , see they , ; I I think they 're ; Um . I don't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it . ; They 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , I believe .
Bed010_540	And so I looked into uh spatial description . ; So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions .
Bed013_2	 ; As usual . ; Yes . ; Whew !
Bed004_428	uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara and about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes ; and ; there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness . ; Mmm .
Bmr010_99	Uh - huh . ; and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ? ; So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . ; Nnn , yeah .
Bmr020_1755	Uh ; Right , but , uh , in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background , ; cuz that would be too much work . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1142	I don't think you can do this , ; Mm - hmm . ; because G is a function from that to that . ; Yep .
Bmr012_675	um ; the uh the data that you take into SRI , first first question , ; you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff , ; right ?
Bmr008_266	Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like Post - Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed004_353	And " usefulness " is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever . ; " Travel constraints " would be something like you know , maybe they said they can they only wanna take a bus or something like that , ; right ? ; And then those are somewhat related to the path ,
Bed002_407	Um , but the p the ; Anyway . So the thing is , i uh , d naively speaking , you 've you 've got a for this little task , a belief - net , ; which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , ; that the person wants to uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it .
Bmr010_563	I mean , I I I I 've ; So who 's gonna do that ? ; Who 's gonna do forced alignment ? ; Well , u uh , IBM was going to .
Bed003_493	Oh . ; " Nice walls " is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , a Oh
Bmr014_1087	It just sends me the time intervals . ; And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . ; I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data ; Yeah .
Bro014_971	Mm - hmm . ; but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version . ; Mm - hmm . ; And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope .
Bmr018_1035	Right ? ; And so you 're ; Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments . ; I agree .
Bro023_1047	uh , no , ; we 've ; which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering . ; I mean , that was I just well , like the overall improvement is like fifty - six point five .
Bro014_499	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; I think that that ; I I
Bed002_621	We need a different , uh , engine . ; Uh , uh , yeah , or something . ; Machine , I mean . ; Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing ,
Bmr014_469	and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards ; e ; but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_872	Depending how nodes are moving , ; well maybe all the time all your neighbors are at the maximum distance ; But , this probably , doesn't l look like uh something very very uh very likely . ; OK ?
Bmr025_66	It 's this one . ; Yep . ; Excellent . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_254	It 's gonna be very hard to be comparable . ; Except that if you have the stimuli comparable , then it says something about the the contribution of setting ; No it 's it 's not the same . ; A little bit ,
Bed005_1047	For example , they could be " time of day " , ; in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning , afternoon , evening , night " . ; So , this could be more ; So , it 's a lot , anyway .
Bed003_313	Inferred from the other ones ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only .
Bed006_597	So maybe there 's something better happening there . ; And then you get you 're shown what movies play which films , ; and it 's gonna be of course all the Heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_215	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . The only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you wanna switch from one thing to another . ; Right .
Bmr023_272	So , um , we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , ; uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . ; Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file . ; And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out .
Bmr022_940	This one . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , something like tha with their cell phones ,
Bro023_849	o ; Yeah . ; So there is also a threshold , of course , ; because after subtraction you can have negative energies ,
Bro021_282	So he was looking he was looking at the peak value . ; Uh - huh . ; Right ? ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_813	So . ; OK . ; I can say two things about the f ; Yes .
Bed012_921	The ; Yeah . ; Any any form - meaning pair , to my understanding , is a construction . ; OK .
Bro027_104	yeah , we we 've tried including the full full bank . ; Right ? ; From zero to four K . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_493	OK . ; So what we do is , uh , when I go to um , select meetings for IBM , I go into the um ; well , into the the , uh , master sheet here with the statuses ; Master .
Bmr009_425	Yeah . ; Then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or ; Yeah . ; This is the thing I I comment with you before , that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping .
Bns002_503	Yeah . ; So this um node has to stop each transmission . ; Yeah . ; So , even the at - the - moment - ongoing transmission .
Bed013_450	Alright , you guys can continue talking about whatever you were talking about before . ; Um , ; We 're talking about this um , alleged paper that we may , just , sort of w ; Oh ! Which Johno mentioned to me .
Bmr003_1670	But what if you wanna edit it ? ; Right ? ; I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate this transcript with five five tracks in it , but with no words . ; Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words .
Btr002_878	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . I see what you 're saying . ; OK . OK . ; I 'll move it move the line back .
Bmr013_610	Oh , great . ; I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . ; OK . ; OK , that 's great .
Bro004_327	and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set . ; That that could be . ; Um So , what about ; So these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh
Bmr009_942	That 's the old and that 's the new . ; Yeah this was the problem with these categories , ; I I picked those categories from TIMIT . ; I don't know what those are .
Btr002_1882	Yeah ! ; Hmm . ; Oh man . ; That was really hard .
Bed002_673	Yeah . ; to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data . ; Right . ; Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know
Bed008_272	You know , you y you go first go the town square ; Well I eh ; No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge ; and doesn't really matter which way you cross
Bmr011_1306	I mean , people didn't ; Yeah . ; uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT ; and , uh w due to its markings ,
Bmr011_1582	and then they tested on , uh , different native speakers from different areas . ; And , uh , ; uh , the worst match was people whose native tongue was Mandarin Chinese . ; The second worst was British English .
Bmr009_509	Uh - huh . ; And then that should give us some indication between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all . ; And then you can move on to the uh uh more pitch related stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1143	And the one to the left of that against the far corner is Linguine . ; Good . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bmr030_445	Yeah . ; and just do it all all uh , analog . ; So plug i So , like , the headphone output in the back of the computer ? ; Well , line out .
Bmr024_465	Uh , so that was the one thing , ; and the other was that , ; um ; What was the other problem ?
Bed015_1580	Mm - hmm . Mmm . ; This was my build - up . ; An i an idea that would be nice i ; Yeah .
Bro005_565	Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also . ; so this is what we decided to do . ; Uh , do you ? ; Let me think .
Bmr018_225	Uh , ; I 'm just thinking that from a data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces . ; OK , so . ; Oh , that 's right .
Bmr003_2602	Right . ; OK , ; Good . ; I can move my thumb now .
Bro011_136	Mm - hmm . ; cuz because um ; uh I was talking with Hynek about it later ; and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much .
Bed011_606	Yeah , when hell Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over . ; Yeah . ; So maybe that should be another property in there . ; Right .
Bro003_168	and I 've added noise to one part , with the actually the Aurora - two noises . ; And , @ @ so this is a training part . ; And then the remaining part , I use for testing and with other kind of noises . ; So we can
Bdb001_1097	Yeah . ; So what I was imagining was um , so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons . ; And so put , uh , a a green ribbon on for an overlap code . ; And since we w we
Bro024_561	No . ; But the fifty is better than the one up above , ; Yeah . ; so I 'm confused .
Bmr006_812	Oh , so you not not marked . ; For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . ; OK . ; Got it .
Bed009_567	yeah . ; Mmm . ; Huh ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1236	Yep . I agree . ; I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question ; You ; which would be " what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? "
Bmr001_837	OK so we 're degenerating , ; right . ; Are are are we done with uh MR business , ; Yep .
Bed014_922	Uh , I don't care . ; I I uh you know I have no fixed ; To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible . ; OK .
Bed008_998	Just sort of so we don't forget . ; Oops . ; Have to get used to this . ; OK ,
Bmr018_1285	and ; and um , ; Anyway . ; um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ?
Bro012_1451	But that , again , was speaker - dependent with lots of feature selection ; and a very complex sort of thing . ; Mmm . ; So I would I would believe that uh it was quite likely that
Bed003_417	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Normally context will include a huge amount of information ,
Bmr009_978	But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them . ; Yeah . ; If you 're if e if y ; This wasn't developed by th these regions weren't
Bro008_308	Or more generally , I guess , what what is causing the degradation . ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; Actually , there is one thing that well Um , generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes ,
Bmr031_704	Right ? ; Change servers ? ; Well , we could we could There are a bunch of disks that we have , uh , that are s s smaller . ; And they 're , like , seventeen .
Bmr003_1737	Mmm . ; Oh . ; But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_974	Yeah . ; Yeah . And then put it in correctly and see how much that helps . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_435	that they 've already signed once . ; I don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns002_243	What what are the d the main differences . ; Well , the main differences come from the fact that , uh in uh in uh wireless transmission we have a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal . ; And the point I 'm trying to show in this picture , is that if for example , this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting , if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme , like for example , CSMA , or something uh uh derivated from it , the problem is that this node will hear the g the m the transmission media , ; it won't be able to hear anything
Bed002_1299	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But even that is problematic . ; If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf ,
Bmr019_880	Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words , ; Mm - hmm . ; you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time , ; if you wanted to do that .
Bmr007_371	But what I mean is that , um in Switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . ; And what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap ; and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is that w uh at least , you know I 'm very interested in the scenario in which , uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible , and from a single microphone . ; And so , in that case , it does get mixed in , and it 's pretty hard to jus to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other .
Bmr010_1243	Uh ; We could skip the digits . ; We don't have to read digits each time . ; Uh
Bns003_531	OK . ; Maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that , um , somewhere beneath this button or wherever , that there 's a date , when the last update was . ; So that you know it 's worth to click this button to see there 's a new , um , announcement or not . ; Yeah , OK .
Bed014_732	is sort of a more a V type . ; Yeah there 's , yeah ther there 's that as well . ; Yep . ; Hmm .
Bro012_755	Um . ; Uh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; I brought some I don't know if some figures here .
Bmr026_979	Mm - hmm . ; uh it was I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . ; When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh at the time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1280	It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there .
Bns002_750	And how do you ; sorry Miguel ; how do you check if if the nodes are moving randomly ? ; Well , uh we are assuming that e y for at least for uh veh uh you know , uh , car and and walking or or people riding a mo motorcycle the f um frame length is so small that only um very very small um space can be can be eh travelled while the transmission is taking place .
Bro016_525	Um , it 's somewhat tuned . ; It 's tuned more than , you know , a a a a ; Mm - hmm . ; You 'd really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all ,
Bdb001_412	which was their file format is just nodes and links , ; and you have to interpret what they mean yourself . ; And why did you not choose that type of approach ? ; Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech ,
Bed003_801	but then went away . ; So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? ; Well , for example , if we include that , ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1067	not the year but just their birthday . ; Not the year . ; I don't know , ; what are the chances of people having the same name .
Bmr012_975	Yeah , and use that . ; Not a bad idea . ; and just use that ; That would be great .
Bro019_1538	So it 's like line spectral pairs . ; Oh , it 's like line sp ; Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle , ; don't they ,
Bed013_1062	and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces , in terms of output . ; Uh ; So we need to find out what the " where is X " construction will give us in terms of semantics ; and Simspec type things .
Bmr016_2112	And and actually , you know the language ; it 's the same point , actually , ; Yeah . ; the the p you know , the word " to " and the word y th " going to " and " to go to "
Bmr031_705	Change servers ? ; Well , we could we could There are a bunch of disks that we have , uh , that are s s smaller . ; And they 're , like , seventeen . ; We could go to thirty - five .
Bro016_641	Right . ; So , uh ; So whatever it was , it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_67	you 'll always read the string correctly . ; So I can't imagine why anyone would care . ; So the other topic with digits is uh , ; Liz would like to elicit different prosodics ,
Btr002_505	Mmm . ; Fancy - schmancy . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bns002_265	this one . ; thank you . ; Eh ; this is what is called a " hidden terminal " problem .
Bed009_793	There w ; Oh from from Stuttgart , ; That 's right . ; They w They had There were This was done with a two phase thing , where the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid
Bro021_1278	Yeah ? ; each time that I detect noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; I do it uh again this
Bed002_27	For our stuff . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .
Bro022_1011	So , uh ; u ; th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . ; And there are there were some bugs in the program ,
Bro026_802	OK . ; and , uh , you know , ; Would it be better if I asked Hari to ask Joe ? ; Uh .
Bmr015_1183	and moving your head ; and all these sorts of things , ; then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now . ; I mean you can
Bmr026_750	I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls ; and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in ; Mm - hmm . ; and I 'd you know , where do we go from here kind of things and
Bmr014_1263	There were quite a few . ; That 's what I thought . ; Uh . ; I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read .
Bmr005_1054	Um , I mean we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation ; because people move around , ; and uh , if if it 's if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's it 's you can't really do inversion , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1359	I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . Well , the likelihoods are ; Was just looking through the log files ,
Bmr006_1658	And that 's OK . ; Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . ; Yeah . Yeah , I think ; Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes .
Bro018_486	you know , if uh uh the example I was giving was that if if you had um onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; um But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong .
Bmr028_1263	So , if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation , then we can't use them in the current way we do scoring . ; We have to m m switch to this o ; Oh , you mean you would need to re - run the recognition . ; No . We have to r
Bmr027_970	Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; once once we ; Yes , absolutely . Yeah . ; One question about the backchannels .
Bro023_106	I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se ; I think I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . ; Something like that . ; And it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using th that same length of time
Bro005_676	So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . ; First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , ; there are that use bad on - line normalization , ; and other good on - line normalization .
Bed016_520	the question is is there any place ; Oh , did you put in something about , ; Metonymy and metaphor here , ; right ?
Bro023_115	So it doesn't seem like that big a d a difference . ; But it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training , ; if you were going to have a short time for ; That that 's true .
Bmr010_1561	but I haven't worked with it a lot . ; So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample ; Nnn , yeah . ; and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random ,
Bro003_801	Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is i is absolutely pure French , ; has nothing to do with ; but he says those those those Parisians talk funny . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro008_404	You you ; you , um ; So , uh , we still have stuff to do . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1336	what I don't think is ever going to be in the ontology , is sort of , you know , the likelihood of , eh , people entering r town halls , and looking at town halls , and approaching town halls , ; especially since we are b dealing with a case - based , ; not an instance - based ontology . ; So , there will be nothing on on that town hall , or on the Berkeley town hall , or on the Heidelberg town hall ,
Bed003_285	Simple . ; Yeah . ; Stab at it . ; Yep .
Bmr011_1768	that 's where it 's a big problem . ; You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , ; the encoding of the ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1072	That 's a good point . ; Yep . ; If you ; And that we know , I mean , we have that .
Bmr006_208	I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that um , wo would be a a possibility . ; OK . ; Uh - huh . ; So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument
Bro007_520	maybe . ; In which case ; so I I uh well we should look ; but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday .
Bed013_966	and then we we we make a thesaurus lexicon , look up , ; and then search dynamically through the uh , discourse history for occurrences of these things in a given window of utterances . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that might , you know , give us additional input to belief A versus B .
Bmr024_147	Yeah . ; Into two pieces . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and I I dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback
Bmr008_539	and then if you 're American you would just circle the region where ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's the concept , ; yeah .
Bro027_1412	The So ; But . ; Yeah , so it 's sort of like ; The tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear LDA .
Bmr018_1167	So we could compare before and after ; and see ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's what I was gonna say .
Bmr013_287	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . ; And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling
Bmr016_508	There you go . ; Not after I " eight " though . ; Uh , they don't all work as well , do they ? ; Hmm .
Bmr011_217	ugh ; well , I mean there 's it 's the double thing . ; It 's the equipment and also how it 's worn . ; And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .
Btr001_2481	Definitely . ; Mmm . ; It 's hard to ; Sometimes they make me laugh so hard ,
Bsr001_2297	And and not within a not within a big room . ; Just , uh . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr013_212	But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . ; I don't know . ; Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , ; and that people might articulate more ,
Bmr014_1059	That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , ; Good . ; that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case . ; But if you really think something is gonna
Bro021_1017	N no , ; but ; Yeah . ; Uh .
Buw001_465	Right . ; Hmm . ; Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem . ; Their sort of note - taking application stuff
Btr001_1628	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_226	Yep . ; Cool . ; Yep . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_2533	Well , now , y This is a good question . ; I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen " hmph " in literature meaning in ; Right . ; but it 's a s a sigh a si uh , sorry . A sound of indignation .
Btr002_1106	I mean like , when I first had started working I would have definitely wanted the PC keyboard , ; The Linguine is OK . ; That 's all I know . ; but now I 'm I 'm just used to it .
Bro024_460	To help out ? ; Sure . ; OK . ; Thanks .
Bro018_61	Oh . ; R c No . ; Auto - correlation ? ; Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that
Bro022_62	with , uh ? ; Oh , oh , you mean the the quals . ; The quals . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1117	uh ; working towards June . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_658	Well , there was an issue . ; He wanted to take it down . ; And then he tried ; H he did , and then it didn't work ,
Bed016_527	Oh yeah , OK . ; Good . I see where you have it . ; So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1952	You know , can People will talk on all these technical things ; but she 'll she 'll say something technical and then laugh , ; and ; It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things .
Bro003_1981	Ah . ; You either do that or you have multiple nets . ; OK . ; I see .
Bmr006_242	" Age - ist " . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah , that 's true .
Btr001_2650	Oh , I see . ; yeah . I looked for that too . ; Uh - huh . ; Up there at the top .
Bmr011_1086	Good . ; Oh good . ; Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , ; uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were ,
Bro003_1720	I mean the the , um ; What was it ? ; What was happening with his thing ? ; He was running through these models very quickly .
Bmr013_208	It isn't actually right . ; In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . ; And you do this gross thing saying " Well I guess it 's this phone starting there " . ; So , uh , that 's the reasoning .
Bro021_1223	No . ; And now , this weight is different now ; OK . ; Yes .
Bmr023_1093	and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it . ; I 'm doing what Eric ; E Eric coached me through then that part of it , ; so I 'm pretty confident in that .
Bmr007_626	Yeah . ; Is the same . ; Yeah , acoustic is fine , ; If if the goal were to just look at overlap you would you could serve yourself save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words .
Bmr009_632	Yeah . ; and you consider eh n eh all the channel to normalize this very short eh ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1282	So , even when I haven't tried , and I cannot tell you for sure , I think that the only problem one network will encounter uh in the presence of the other is a little bit of more noise . ; And this will produce a little bit less throughput , ; but nothing more . ; I don't expect any any more problem .
Bro027_403	and he , uh got his PHD . ; Oh , OK . ; He ; And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years .
Bmr002_783	Different coding schemes . ; But it doesn't have enough pictures . ; So , I think it will require too much reading to understand whether this is anything that we can easily use . ; OK .
Bmr030_861	Yeah . ; And then , um ; If you do " man customs " , it has almost all of that . ; OK .
Bmr002_428	But I r I don't use them . ; They 're not even plugged in . ; Wow . ; That 's so cool .
Bed006_1095	Um it occur it occurs to me that I mean ne ; Right . ; Or the intended interpretation of this . ; Yeah .
Buw001_106	I I don't remember , ; Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? ; La - Landay ? ; Landay . James .
Bro025_684	Hmm . ; I guess the week after he 'll be , uh , going back to Europe , ; and so we wanna ; Is he in Europe right now or is he up at ?
Bed004_342	Right , ; yep . ; Um , you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever , ; Right .
Bmr003_1432	I wanna say cursor ; but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing . ; Point , ; whatever .
Bns001_1402	So ; In in the better case , maybe I 'm only able to add two different networks to this thing . ; So ah ; the difficulty I see is that ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology .
Bmr022_450	Well , th although ; " Beep . One thousand three hundred forty - two " ; You 're saying i it 's it 's about an hour meeting , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_809	Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , ; or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? ; Um , I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms ; and I don't know exactly who to ask .
Bro011_418	I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . ; But I know I just remember it had to do with you know uh positional parameters ; What ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1364	Yeah . ; Oh , I could ! ; I if it w ; Yeah .
Bro018_763	No , no . ; I 'm not I 'm not planning to do any any phoneme mapping yet . ; Just it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection of phonological features . ; Uh - huh .
Bro028_405	If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say " OK , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . " ; Mmm . ; But from this it 's pretty safe to say that the system is with either two to seven percent away from the performance of a human . ; Right ?
Bmr020_148	Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; so . ; yeah .
Buw001_2202	I really liked the idea of ; what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . ; Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking . ; So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ?
Bmr014_544	then cuz " neural nets " and oh she has some things that are oh " downsampled " , she got that right . ; Hmm . ; And some of these are rather uh unexpected . ; Obscure ,
Bed006_863	So are we worrying about that or not for now ? ; Yes , yes . ; OK . ; Since you bring it up now , we will worry about it .
Bsr001_2050	so . ; Um , so we 're actually ; So the bit we 're a bit deficient in as we ; So I I think probably the biggest thing would
Bed010_500	OK . ; Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already . ; So . ; OK ,
Bed009_35	OK . ; OK . ; this is Ami , who ; And this is Tilman and Ralf .
Bro008_434	but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , ; and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it . ; But , um , that was just sort of one try , ; right ?
Bmr028_1010	Mm - hmm . ; That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants . ; The other thing is that you actually have direction here . ; Right .
Bed006_1025	See . ; Buying buying his food ; I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere . ; Oop .
Bed002_739	So there were never answers . ; Uh - huh . ; OK . OK . ; But , is it
Bmr028_310	Y I mean , John Osterhaut , uh Y you know , he started his own company based on Tcl stuff , ; and maybe they have the native code compiler or something . ; I mean , we could check . ; I don't think they do .
Bed011_29	So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side . ; Commented and what they 're about and sort of the properties we may um give them . ; And here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection . ; So all of these tasks
Bed016_760	so , um , ; Right . ; could we capture that ; with a different construal of
Btr002_1998	It 's interesting cuz like , um , when I 'm working late at night , I actually don't feel so lonely ; But ; because there 's so many voices in my head . ; You mean when you leave here ?
Bmr024_312	Yeah . ; So I think that that 's gonna , also eh , you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Btr002_2164	Mmm , well , mm - hmm , mm - hmm that 's right , ; Uh - huh . ; cuz you 're involved in gesture research . ; Yeah .
Btr001_295	I can tell she 's pronouncing pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a you know , a Spanish speaker 's mind that you would , you know , pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish . ; But the same time , uh I can't get most of it , ; cuz I ; Huh , that 's really interesting .
Bro021_1238	that . ; I can calculate I can I calculated this value , uh , with the statistic of the noisy speech that I calculated before with the VTS approximation . ; Mm - hmm . ; And well , normalizing .
Bed011_1102	the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the the " How do I get to X ? " , ; you know , that 's definitely gonna be uh , a major one .
Bsr001_471	Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment ; but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad , ; It was pretty bad . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1869	Cuz cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription that I have on my account ; Either 's fine . ; We c ; but it doesn't matter .
Bmr001_795	and if they ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it ; Mm - hmm . ; and um then uh like I say , check it out with an external service and see if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever . ; Right .
Bro028_668	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , he 's been putting this stuff out on their web site and for people to grab ; but I haven't heard too much about what 's happening . ; So it could be I mean , Chuck and I had actually talked about this a couple times , and and over some lunches , I think , that , um , one thing that we might wanna do
Bmr023_1201	So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , uh uh , in the Aurora thing . ; Oh . OK . ; Yeah . That makes sense . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_824	Yeah , OK good . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Good point .
Bro019_1586	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner . ; I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well .
Bmr018_940	If it 's really a noise . ; or just say it 's just put " X , " you know , like " not speech " or something , ; and then you can get ; I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,
Bro019_1497	yeah ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Thanks Dave . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1531	So , those are the three three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers . ; And , um , ; hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff ; and look at , uh , these numbers and see see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that .
Bed016_537	mmm . Um . ; Uh , OK , so where where is it , ; cuz I 'll have to take a look . ; Um , but I I did not focus on that aspect
Bmr022_1077	cuz they 're too big . ; You 're never gonna be copying them around and making working copies of them . ; Right . ; And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues .
Bro004_1096	There it is . ; Um Cuz there 's " baseline Aurora " above it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's This is mostly better than baseline ,
Bed014_1317	But if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world um then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_474	They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on . ; Alright . ; And one one notable difference u u ; actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not ,
Bed003_1645	Yeah . ; So the uh ; That will be one one thing we could do . ; I actually uh , have Um ,
Bmr019_309	or something that can stand in as a speaker ID . ; So , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , TI - digits database . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr022_1370	Yeah . Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . ; maybe , m you know , they could they could 've told you , ; but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you ,
Bmr006_1550	So , is it really , um You know ? ; Mmm . ; Ugh ! ; Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name .
Bmr008_1668	And and uh , that 's that 's something to think about and experiment with . ; Yeah . ; I think also the harmonics would be very important . ; So if you can find voiced regions and
Bed013_371	eight pages , ; and I just don't know what you have in mind for expanding . ; Like I 'd I what I didn't do is go to the web site of the conference ; and look at what they 're looking for or whatever .
Bro024_797	uh ; in in the models . ; I mean , i you you train it also this way ; but , i somehow there is u u there is no longer a a Gaussian distribution .
Bro026_775	Yeah . ; Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . ; So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors ; and what 's what 's the plan about that ?
Bed016_609	And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . ; This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bmr019_404	Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah . ; Anyway , what I was saying is that I I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to . ; That looks good . ; Yeah .
Bed011_796	I think there are there 're different things where you have a ch choice , ; Mmm . ; for example , uh this t interacts with " do am I do oh are you willing to take a taxi ? " ; Yeah .
Bed004_368	Uh , Prosody I don't really I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context , ; so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it is is that . ; Right , OK . ; Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose ,
Bro012_250	That 's supposed to be point six , for the self - loop . ; Yeah . ; Point It 's supposed to be point six . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1656	Yeah . ; There 's just plain cost , ; That 's a big one . ; you know ,
Bro016_1140	and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way , ; uh , similar to the way that , uh , Jeff Jeff , uh , Bilmes did his work . ; Um , ; and while I 'm I 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , I can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets .
Bro013_236	I I I don't I ; Yeah . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment , ; Mm - hmm . ; just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system ,
Bed005_906	OK . ; So eh Yeah . ; So , what happened is , ; there 's this , eh , uh
Bed003_1358	How much is built into SmartKom and ; It works like this . ; The uh , um I mean . ; The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t
Bmr009_412	Mm - hmm . ; and we label some data for you , and we say this is what we think is going ; Mm - hmm . ; So you don't have to worry about it .
Bmr002_525	or paying less the first pass and editing more later . ; So ; Yeah . ; Well , whatever they people who have had to do this
Bro022_519	And , yeah , that 's everything . ; All set ? ; Do you want to go , Stephane ? ; Um . Yeah .
Bmr023_378	And to use them for for training a or for fo whatever . Yeah . ; To to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , ; and Yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what I 'm just looking into . ; OK .
Bmr011_1650	So ; if anyone has ideas , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1396	and ; But the problem is that their models are all word level models . ; So there 's no phone models that you get alignments for . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1413	And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed ; Mm - hmm . ; and they used LabCut to to pass . ; OK ,
Bed015_1958	Got it . ; Mmm . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bmr006_818	So you 're not using all of the data . ; The All I Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1393	you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um , n the ; it has a little bar of where the meeting is , ; like in ; Yes .
Bmr016_2029	and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer ; an uh , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis . ; And , um , the implication that that I have is that th the master copy will stay unchanged . ; These will just be things that are generated ,
Bro007_117	Now up ; but ; Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection . ; Yeah .
Bro025_614	Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bro028_1020	uh , but it 's not exactly the same . ; Um , ; I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different ; but , um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints .
Bmr024_656	So we save it because it 's it it 's potentially useful . ; Right . ; And now , what do we do with it is is a s separate question . ; I mean , anybody who 's training something up could choose to put it eh , to u include this or not .
Bro003_1653	Um . ; Well , we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments . ; Um . ; This being ?
Bro022_1040	But still it 's like it 's still comparable to the baseline . ; I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . ; But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . ; And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR .
Bmr030_455	Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy . ; So I mean , that 's the easy way . ; They might have a more complex set - up at IBM . ; I 've seen digital digital analog tapes where it 's controlled by the computer .
Bro028_98	Right . ; Um , ; and I don't know how much this can be discussed or not , ; because it 's it could be in ROM ,
Bmr020_1618	Yeah ? ; And to to re - run 's ; Eh , um . Yeah . I 've got a a P - a method with loops into the cross - correlation with the PZM mike , ; Uh - huh .
Bro016_760	And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features . ; So if it if in fact , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; The problem might be that the range of the MSG features is quite different than the range of the PLP or mel cepstrum .
Bro028_492	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . At these noise levels . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro023_363	so what 's it start on ? ; The MFCC baseline is is what ? ; Is at what level ? ; It 's the
Bro003_1285	and see if we can calculate them . ; a a Am I am I interpreting this correctly ? ; Is this sort of what what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ? ; Mmm .
Bro012_1096	I mean . ; You know ? ; it 's ; you can't work on everything .
Btr001_2072	Mmm . ; so it 's like you have these unusual configuration problems that that you wouldn't normally have . ; Right . ; Yeah , blindfolds .
Bmr013_106	Per digit . ; Per digit . ; You 're right . ; So if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble .
Bro014_1423	It 's on the filter bank , ; so . ; So , yeah , ; probably
Bed012_681	On on Friday . ; Which Friday ? ; This this Friday . ; OK .
Bro022_353	I wonder if there could be something like , uh for s for the PZM data , ; uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . ; Uh . ; I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio .
Bed017_290	Alright . ; More uncertainty , or or ; Uh , ; I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure ,
Bmr019_421	N ; Well . ; OK . ; Yeah . This would be OK .
Bmr024_707	It 's got a different purpose . ; But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , ; Yeah . ; but I don't think i it it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings .
Bed005_453	It 's ; Right . ; Absolutely . ; OK .
Bmr024_1288	So there must be some something else going on . ; Well , what 's the standard ? ; Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males . ; That 's what I thought , too .
Bed011_38	so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and that may or may not be a problem . ; We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node ; so trying to im um implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , ; or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .
Bro010_75	Yeah . ; No , I mean , because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_616	Right . ; Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case . ; OK . ; The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ?
Bmr026_23	and ; Which meetings is she transcribing ? ; Speaking ; Um well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM .
Bed011_513	OK . ; But this is open . ; So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy . ; And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense .
Btr002_3345	Good question . ; And you don't have to add any of those tags . ; Oh ! ; The only tags that you need to add , is
Bro017_1237	And use this Intel version . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_784	So how does this Source - Path - Goal schema fit into the uh action schema ? ; Like is it one of the tags there ? ; Yeah can you go back to that one ? ; So the Source - Path - Goal schema in this case ,
Bmr009_1426	Yeah , and ; Yeah . ; Is that a real accent ? ; Sure , yeah !
Bro003_667	right ? ; That there 's some training data and some test data . ; So that 's different than this . ; Right , right .
Bed009_798	and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context . ; Right . ; Yeah ; Right ?
Bmr019_147	And the interesting thing is that even though , yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , it 's just not as good as having a a l very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big HMM . ; Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this . ; Um . So . Um . ; And we know
Bro018_620	And th the ; You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian mixtures for that matter are sort of fairly brute force kinds of things , where you sort of you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters ; and then you you place them as you best can to define the boundaries , ; and in fact , as you know , these things do take a lot of parameters
Bro008_187	Huh . ; I think tha I think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something . ; Yeah , ; this Tuesday ,
Bro012_213	Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that ; Well . ; Eh uh ; and it 's it 's really wo really happens .
Bmr006_1138	Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . ; Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't ; Hmm . ; Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
Bro021_790	Do you How much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you 're adjusting it ? ; Or how much do you think is intrinsic to ? ; Pfft . I don't know ; because
Bmr003_594	And so you make Jane do the first one ; So . ; so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff , ; just the words are fine .
Bro024_334	Bec - because I so this SmartKom task first off , it 's this TV and movie information system . ; Yeah , but you might have somebody who 's using it ; And ; and then later you might have somebody else who 's using it .
Bro024_1538	Like , around five percent worse I guess . ; Uh - huh . ; And if you add too much noise it get worse also . ; And it seems that right now this this is c a constant that does not depend on on anything that you can learn from the utterance .
Bed004_623	So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is ; OK . ; where are you gonna ; how are you gonna g get this information .
Bed011_648	Eh , just meeting people , basically . ; Oh ; " I want to meet someone somewhere " , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the " EVA " ; you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually ,
Bmr015_1072	And once in a while breath is communicative , ; but r very rarely . ; OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1042	Mis - Mississippi State maybe , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; I 'm not sure about that .
Bed016_535	Is that in there ? ; Yeah , ; mmm . Um . ; Uh , OK , so where where is it ,
Bmr007_71	Do you want me to be there for that ? ; I noticed you C C ' ed me , but I wasn't actually a recipient . ; I didn't quite know what to make of that . ; Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting .
Bmr009_49	and I uh ; We didn't talk about the derivatives . ; But I think , you know , the the i ; if I can if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit , um Uh .
Bro019_758	Yeah . ; So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , ; so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , ; and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something ,
Bmr005_1357	and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it ; and we we start , you know asking about the timing for it . ; Yep . ; So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .
Bed004_774	So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case , ; right ? ; but I don't yet ; see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep uh cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations .
Bmr011_1006	Well we can talk about more details later . ; um , you know , ; yeah , ; Yeah .
Bro013_779	It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things . ; Oh . OK . ; That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups . ; OK .
Bed012_326	Excuse me . ; has these values . ; And , um , ; Oh , I see why we can't do that .
Bmr013_438	Um , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , ; And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . ; That , that if we , can we should put in , uh , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . ; Well , you know , um I mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like ,
Bmr018_82	I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was . ; What conference ? ; Uh , I had one question about ; Yeah , really .
Bro027_1647	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So that that 's , uh ; but just
Buw001_695	even lip movement and things like that , ; for this kind of task . ; And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1374	Uh , OK . ; S so , we switch off with this ; Whenever you 're ready . ; or n ?
Bdb001_73	so that you start with with a time - line tag . ; " Time - line " . ; And then you have a bunch of times . ; I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was ,
Bmr011_1593	it was Swiss w ; Yeah , so it 's ; so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want , uh American English , ; I wonder if we have any .
Bed012_145	or know the location ? ; Or does he want to go there ? ; Let 's assume this is our our question . ; Sure .
Btr002_2717	But yes . Yeah , exactly . ; I wouldn't , uh i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put " breath " and we leave it in . ; But absolutely there , yeah . ; Good . OK .
Bmr005_1199	There 's laughter , ; um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , ; maybe with manager types , or ; I think it 's hard to record those .
Bsr001_1809	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing . ; Right .
Bro021_508	Yeah , ; m ; or ? ; Um , well , I 'm gonna f work with TIMIT
Bmr023_945	He made it a parameter . ; So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it ; and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , ; which is great .
Bmr010_678	That 's what I was saying earlier , ; th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect ; and , hey , that 's life . ; But I I think that it it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible ,
Bed003_328	So some of the the top row of things ; What 's what 's " Disc admission fee " ? ; whether they discuss the admission fees . ; So we looked at the data
Bns003_159	but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than , uh , one box which you have on your desktop , ; cuz that is the primary , uh uh reason for this testbed . ; So , definitely you have to have web access to download the necessary files . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bmr006_1566	OK . ; Uh , I think you don't wanna have their full name to be uh , listed . ; Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say " your first name may arise in the course of the meetings " . ; And so
Bed005_713	And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed ; because there is an ontology , ; and the database , and stuff . ; So it isn't like , um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that .
Bro011_758	it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like um ; you can have cells and you can you can uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . ; Uh Octave doesn't do that yet , ; so I think you ,
Bmr019_924	It was the one from last week . ; Yes . ; Yes , I did . ; And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where not not a lot , but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's .
Btr002_1446	Cuz you end up missing entire frames . ; it skips . Yeah . ; So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right , ; Ye - I was surprised by that .
Bdb001_579	You would have like a speaker tag or something ? ; there 's a spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them ; and then each utt ; the way I had it is each turn or each utterance , I don't even remember now , had a speaker ID tag attached to it .
Bed013_495	I 'll ; OK . ; And the ad and and the deadline is the fifteenth of June . ; I don't know about it .
Bro022_438	I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . ; Yeah . ; But this ; uh , uh , uh , no .
Bro021_1115	This is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s Taylor series . ; Yeah , sure . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_424	Well Well OK . Well let 's try it . ; That 's right . ; I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious , ; but I really , I mean , I 'm I don't feel strongly enough that it 's a good idea ,
Bed003_1179	Right . ; Very future . ; Mm - hmm . ; And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all , then you have " What I learned " , as a slide .
Buw001_1271	As many are willing to do it . ; Make it a voluntary thing , ; Yeah . ; Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ?
Bmr020_665	Yeah . ; That 's w That 's what I do . ; Random intervals . ; There was there was of course a Monty Python sketch with that .
Bmr001_420	That that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit . ; Well I think it 's I think it 's two gig an hour . ; Is it two gig an hour ? ; I 'm off by an order of magni
Bmr016_2285	And that 's wh that 's where it becomes a little bit uh , having to rerun the processing . ; Mm - hmm . ; The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_345	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; Well we 've got we 've got Right now we could have two more people on wireless , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_624	With the , uh ; Fletcher Munson ? ; No . ; I 'm not sure about the term .
Bmr001_754	Right . ; This was this was the point of having near zero skew . ; Right ? ; Right ?
Bro003_461	right ? ; Which is PLP , or something ? ; right . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_579	I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not not for words . ; Right . ; So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality ; Right .
Bns001_366	And in my conf uh considered end system , there is a certain kind of policy , concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things . ; How to use quality of service , you know , in advance , ; because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services . ; And that should not be done automatically .
Bro004_1242	I mean that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , ; yeah ; you p put some low level noise or something . ; Probably don't want all zeros .
Bmr009_883	Actually you could ; Well that does raise another question , which is why is the " Professional use only " line not higher ? ; Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ? ; Oh . Because we 're filling in other things .
Bmr010_795	And then there 's mass . ; Mm - hmm . ; Anyway . ; I could say something about about the
Bmr024_1543	So , that 's pretty good . ; Oh ! ; Cool . ; Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet ,
Bro028_686	and scale those . ; And then , uh , um then at least those things would have the right values ; or the right the right range . ; And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations .
Bro010_1060	Uh ; There 's also things like stress . ; You can look at stress . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1546	Yeah , ; could well be . ; So so , I mean , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point , ; but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant
Bro016_1101	Mm - hmm . ; Um . A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this . ; I mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gonna fire because something novel has happened . ; That was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there .
Bmr020_424	I mean , you still ; Well I should bring the should bring the table with results . ; Maybe we can look at it Monday . ; I would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than
Bed002_1091	Right . ; It 's OK . ; which might be useful too . ; Right .
Bro028_1072	Hmm . ; So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff . ; And and and , uh , ; the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way .
Bsr001_664	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; which is non - trivial . ; Yeah .
Bed003_84	OK , fine . ; Here , let 's see if I can ; Alright . ; Very nice .
Bro022_441	uh , uh , uh , no . ; Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD. ; And these period these typically do have a DC offset . ; Oh , OK .
Bro012_409	It 's ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . ; It 's just
Bro013_600	and it clearly appears here , ; and the the harmonics are resolved by the f ; Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2428	Which I just transcribe as " mouth " . ; Heard that one . ; Oh , I see . ; I just make a mouth
Bro018_959	But um I didn't quite understand everything that I saw , ; Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all . ; so ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_131	So , ye ; Well , that 's fine , ; They 're close enough . ; but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now .
Bro008_391	uh , but ; But the I mean , the th th ; Even the optimistic one is ; it doesn't work .
Bro005_806	Yeah . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency ; So that 's what you say th there . ; I see . ; Well , the e e But this is still not clear
Bmr006_1675	If if if if someone says , uh , " what what is Jose doing ? " and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah , yeah ,
Bed002_690	Sure . ; You know , because then , uh , you ; u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . ; Right ?
Bmr019_598	and ; So so , but where is this now ? ; I mean , what 's where do we go from here ? ; I mean ,
Bro024_927	Right ? ; Or or F F ; one or the other . ; But but they do not apply filtering of the log energy or what
Bmr018_699	there were I think fifty - five segments , um , in in X Waves , and and sort of did a crude check , ; and more often than not , it it gets it wrong . ; So there 's either the beginning , mostly the beginning word , where th you , um , you know , Chuck talks somewhere into the segment , ; but the first , um , word of what he says , often " I "
Bro017_421	Right . ; Well , I mean , I 've known other friends who they they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married , ; Yeah . ; I know .
Bed013_504	Yeah . And one one from your perspective , and one from our peve per per ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , th that 's the kinda thing that maybe like , um , the general uh con sort of like NTL - ish like , whatever , the previous simulation based pers maybe you 're talking about the same kind of thing . A general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1216	but it 's different from the transcript . ; So UW records a meeting , ; we transcribe it . ; Yeah .
Bns003_934	The second question is how long I stay here ; and say ooo , I don't know " , ; so ; everybody 's waiting .
Bmr006_237	Age - ist . ; Well , age - ist . The " eighteen " is because of the consent form . ; Right , Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1560	Yeah . ; Does something . ; It doesn't work as well . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1189	It would make sense . ; OK . ; Oh yeah , the basic idea is that ; um , uh you know
Bmr014_1156	Oh , ; Sorry transcribers . ; Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how " hmm - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . " ; Yeah .
Bns001_91	So , please . ; Well , I , uh , as all of you know I came from from Spain , ; from the uh Polytechnic University of Valencia ; and i uh I um , just finished my PHD thesis about uh um power - saving techniques for wireless networking .
Bmr009_381	meaning the kind that 's a friendly encouragement , like " Mm - hmm . " , ; " Great ! " , ; " Yeah ! " ; Yeah .
Bro012_928	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it does get better even though it looks ugly . ; Uh
Bro004_963	But perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information . ; Uh . ; So so again then we have these broad classes ; and well , somewhat broad .
Bed006_1406	And I think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon . ; So this is nice about being being recorded also . ; Right . ; The um
Bed015_1543	Twhhh - whhh . ; But ; Mm - hmm . ; So this entire thing is inside a world ,
Bmr024_1496	That 's correct . ; So , those features look at the data differently , actually . ; Yeah , but ; I mean , you know , they they will find boundaries a little differently , though
Bmr006_784	Yeah . ; Is ; One or two or more . ; One , two , three .
Bro012_441	What 's a little bit ? ; Like ; Like , it 's difficult to say ; because again
Bed002_940	And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .
Buw001_583	th this is one of the larger meetings . ; Most of the meetings we have are four or five people ; That 's true are four or five people . ; and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it .
Bro027_1309	Uh , w i ; It was b a little bit worse . ; Than ? ; Than just the features ,
Bro007_17	Um those features go through a contextualized KLT . ; Yeah . ; Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered ; Yeah
Bed013_246	Actually ; Oh ! We calculated a different number before . ; How did we do that ? ; Hmm .
Bdb001_1122	Or the ? ; I 'm not sure what that @ @ ; Well , I mean , is that ; Well , we don't have to go into the codes .
Bed005_141	or are we gonna see that ? ; right ? ; Well , w w We d The first we did is we we tried to to do change the the " laufen " into " run " , or " running " , or " runs " . ; Yep .
Bmr003_1907	Right , ; so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . ; and ; Nice .
Bro014_1105	whatever it ; You - you 're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain ? ; In log domain . ; Log domain .
Bmr006_1215	I I I I I th ; and ; Well , it 's ; Yeah .
Bmr022_355	Wow , that 'd also be shorter to type . ; Yeah , just a " two three , two four " , that would be ; Well , they would have to have a mark . ; There 'd be some kind of mark in front of it .
Bmr012_787	but if it 's ; Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories ; so , ; Yeah .
Bns001_360	So , if I switch If if , because of my motion , I 'm switching , or I 'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network , well , I I want the service to be uh stopped . " ; And this can be some pattern then that some users will follow . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but if your s
Bmr021_624	Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record . ; OK . ; There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone , ; one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between " sponsor " and their name .
Bro003_907	even if it 's not matching ; just because there 's some more variance that you 've built into things . ; But , but , uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_457	Um , I have some news from the generation , ; do you have news from the parser ? ; Um , not ; By that look I
Buw001_2078	So . ; Is that is that going to be publicly available , ; As far as I know , they h have not . ; or ?
Bmr011_21	Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Now , yeah .
Bed015_132	And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . ; Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . ; So so by saying if I just said " Name one " then that means name one formal ; and we 're talking about formal struc Which which makes sense .
Bro011_341	um ; So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , ; do you ha still have that ? ; Oh yeah .
Bro012_319	but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations ; and then they built the silence model ; and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures ; and they do another seven then they add mixtures
Bmr026_939	Although we I mean , it 's not that many fewer and and and we take a KLT anyway so we could ; Right . ; Exactly . ; So so that was the other thing .
Bns001_1496	Yeah , ; if you go with something what what Wilbert mentioned " OK , let 's have this one here " . We have a new PCMCIA card and and extend something and the end system , or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter - working in the end s , then you have an an a device which you can sell . ; If you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements , in principle , and and understanding next generation building blocks , uh there 's no product . ; Hmm - hmm .
Bmr015_661	just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , ; Yeah . ; and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_369	Yep . ; I I I I I agree . ; Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so ; Uh but I I think that the uh i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .
Bmr010_785	Mmm , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know why that is . ; Well , I mean , you Yeah , of course . You 're you 're also
Bmr006_329	Oh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You you can .
Bmr031_844	the date on this one is July twenty - sixth , ; so , uh , I have to update it . ; A couple weeks ago . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1003	Well , it 's it 's much simpler . ; But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say . ; Greedy . ; So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right .
Bmr006_1708	Right . ; Uh - huh . ; Ugh ! ; Yeah .
Bed006_834	But it 's independent whether we are using the SPG schema in an Enter , View , or Approach mode , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; This is just properties of the SPG schema .
Btr002_2720	Good . OK . ; " Laugh " , change it . ; And , you know , there are other places where it 's in the way , you know . ; I I mainly said not to change their " breath " 's simply because it would take time to move them if
Bmr027_1234	since it 's short . ; Um , well , uh . ; Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . ; The disk space was short .
Bmr019_940	Right . ; Yeah , I I mean , i in retrospect it would 've been good to ha have got I should 've gotten a headphone . ; But in any case , um , thi this is this was transcribed in a in a , uh , less optimal way than than the ones that came after it , ; and I was able to you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications
Bsr001_2020	yeah . ; And the amazing thing is that even even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff . ; Big endian , little endian ? ; Yeah .
Bmr010_536	Um , to code d ; so types of overlap ? ; What you you ; Yeah .
Bro022_45	So should I go so that , uh , ; Yeah . ; Why don't you go ahead , Barry ? ; you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ?
Bed015_1298	Yeah . ; So those constraints appear in constructions ; Mm - hmm . ; but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you .
Bed015_72	So they could all have a type at the beginning . ; Um , and then they say the key word construction ; Oh , I see . ; and they have some name .
Bro025_0	 ;  ;  ; Alright . We 're on .
Bmr011_1035	So , ; uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed ; which we did have some problems with , ; and Thilo , uh , I think told me why this was ,
Bmr028_1395	Uh , it 's it 's really cheating . ; It 's us it 's using information you wouldn't normally have . ; It 's just ng ; Yeah . Yeah .
Btr002_1418	Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice ; That kind of makes sense ; Yes . ; and then in n sometimes i it wouldn't ,
Bed014_1411	I 'm I 'm in favor of that . ; Uh , cuz I think i I think it 's As you know , I think it 's real hard and if w if we ; Right . ; So Friday ,
Bro017_214	but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much , ; it 's a very simple technique . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique ,
Bmr002_1372	OK . ; And then we were going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well . ; I mean notice that n ; Well .
Btr002_2530	like " hmph " ? ; Hmm ! ; Oh . ; Well , now , y This is a good question .
Bmr011_874	Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat uh , secretarial ; I don't think that they 're court reporters . ; I don't think they have the special keyboards and that and that type of training . ; I I get the sense they 're more secretarial .
Bro007_111	An ; Yeah ; there is something funny happening here because ; yeah .
Bed015_1018	which is , um , the discourse situation context record , ; right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line ; and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . ; Right .
Bro021_482	Mm - hmm . ; um , I would say , uh , go into the corresponding LNA file and zonk out the the posteriors for , um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then see what kinds of improvements I get .
Bed015_976	It 's like , " oh ! " It was an epiphany that it you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . ; So topic is ; Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , ; or a landmark trajector , or some something like that .
Bro028_726	And just adjust it until it 's the best number ? ; and just adjust it until that our l version of the back - end , uh , decides that that ; Well , we can probably use the real thing , ; can't we ?
Bro024_1068	Mm - hmm . ; Well , that the they would need that forty milliseconds also . ; Right ? ; No .
Buw001_1732	The URL ; so they can click on an utterance and hear it . ; and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions ; which you got a copy of today .
Bmr007_641	right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , not as well as what I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1317	i ; uh ; But it 's , uh Well , it strikes me as a What For ; If we get the mechanism , that will be sort of the wonderful part .
Bro005_340	Yeah ; And the MSG doesn't however particularly affect things . ; No . ; And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error .
Bed010_577	I don't think it it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different . ; Um , as a matter of fact ; No , it 's not . ; Right .
Bro007_63	so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ? ; For the f the f first yellow line you mean ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah
Bro003_1536	Do you know these yet ? ; I don't know what kind . ; Nuh - uh . ; Yeah , OK .
Btr001_1259	Yeah . ; Something like that , right ? ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro004_681	yeah . ; I assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from Dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . ; It was true on uh TI - digits but it 's not true on Italian . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_948	uh ; Did you just say grateful for us ? ; OK , sorry . ; Anyway .
Bro018_85	R R - zero . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence .
Bmr020_1595	But ; Yeah . ; So there 'd you 'd think there 'd be a a factor of three or four in in , uh , cost function , ; OK .
Btr002_442	Hmm . ; Well , you know , there 's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1363	Is it wrong ? ; Right . ; or incomplete , ; and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise .
Bmr003_619	and , uh , ; duh , again o ; I object to that characterization ! ; Oh , really .
Buw001_1594	I got ; Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . ; eee , ; OK .
Btr002_1474	and then you have a bar . ; I think you 're referring to this bar , aren't you ? ; I think ; Yeah .
Bed013_959	So ; we don't want a hard code , a set of lexemes , or things , that person 's you know , sort of filter , or uh search the discourse history . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what would be kind of cool is that if we encounter concepts that are castle , tower , bank , hotel , we run it through the ontology ,
Bmr030_62	So that the the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions . ; And so , uh , ; Uh , OK . ; So this had a lot of different stuff in it .
Bro027_991	And ; So you tried the global KLT before ; Well ; Yeah .
Bro021_103	Yeah . ; And then this time constant increases ; and I have a threshold that ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_965	" Kay " , ; yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; S
Bro023_5	Damn . ; And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , OK .
Bns002_74	And eh , well , mainly I will present ; uh Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation . ; I will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad - hoc networks are , ; about the issues in media access control in wireless networks ,
Bro003_150	Uh I 'll I 'll I 'll I 'll give you my phone number , ; If I 'm not here for a few m after a few minutes then ; Wake you up . ; Nah , I 'll be fine .
Bro022_1002	it 's ; go ahead . ; And it 's ; It
Bro014_915	Uh - huh . ; So , ; really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced . ; So that could be giving you a lot of variance .
Bed003_1250	Yeah ? ; And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , ; um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else ; and that you are in a in a in a route
Bro014_545	I mean , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important , ; but it 's just that it it it does seem to be i uh , a lot of work to do a good job on on that ; and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_498	We 'll see that . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Actually , I had a question about that .
Bmr014_1181	but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . ; I don't know how to notate that . ; Sarcasm , ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bed014_568	and then there is the , uh , middle way that I 'm suggesting ; and that is you you get X , which is whatever , ; the castle . ; The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours ,
Bmr022_671	Yeah . ; Yep . ; You know , like ; I think it would save them time .
Bmr023_465	Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . ; And then , Jane also s prepared a um , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . ; So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have ; been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff .
Bns001_958	Of course , yeah , this this group could do that , too . ; Could be , ; but ; I have a an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS .
Bro018_80	I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use . ; Mmm . ; See , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um " does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_405	and they generate keystrokes . ; Oh , that 's totally cool . ; now how how do you how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ? ; Um There 's a little program that downloads into it .
Btr001_890	i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm I I i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way , ; you know , ; Mm - hmm . ; so it 's like it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um , of of pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me .
Bmr022_1146	w w ; Well ; Right ? ; Right .
Bmr019_870	If it ? ; OK . ; I think so . ; So you would know this more than I would .
Bmr016_1132	OK . ; Exactly . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed016_574	So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal ; and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar . ; And it is the same grammar . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_67	Yep . ; Excellent . ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bmr019_1359	Well , then you can just ; Oh , well maybe we 'll submit to s Actually ; Maybe you can submit the digits paper on e for the Aurora session . ; Yeah .
Bro021_341	You used thirteen ; and we used fifteen . ; Well , a bunch of differences . ; And , um , actually the result that he he got were much better on TI - digits especially .
Bmr012_696	Yeah . ; Great . ; Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will ; I didn't know that actually .
Bro022_387	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1124	Whereas HLT and and Eurospeech , pretty pretty pretty similar , so I I I can't see really just putting in the same thing , ; Are too close , ; yeah . ; No , I d I don't think that paper is really
Bmr018_685	Yeah . ; You did you have , uh , something in the report about , uh , about , uh , for f uh , forced alignment ? ; Have you have you started on that ? ; Oh , well , yeah , so I 've been struggling with the forced alignments .
Bro007_107	Uh ; Uh OK so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_751	Yeah . ; But It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . ; So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1631	a network service . ; There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day ; and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start - ups or whatever . ; And just think of a service like that , if I could do this .
Bro023_1633	Yeah . ; I , um , also implemented a sp um spectral whitening idea ; which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal . ; Uh , the idea is just to um , flatten the log , uh , spectrum , um , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher .
Bro023_851	So there is also a threshold , of course , ; because after subtraction you can have negative energies , ; Mm - hmm . ; and
Bmr029_396	Uh , that 's right . ; I mean the other thing which which it might come in to is if there was some problem in the retraining . ; I mean , maybe you 'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1228	Hub - five . ; This is on ; This is Hub - five . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr028_1011	That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants . ; The other thing is that you actually have direction here . ; Right . ; So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location .
Bed015_1896	Yeah . ; And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser . ; Mm - hmm . ; Knowing uh
Bed012_213	But , why why why only those three ? ; Why not the whol ; Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question . ; So we 'd have a node for the Where - Is question .
Bed014_533	s so that you just know wanna know where it is . ; Yeah . ; Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? ; Exactly . Yeah .
Bmr010_1220	I mean , i I I don't know what uh , level of detail would be most useful . ; I don't know i if that 's something that I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; But this issue of the contents of the meeting
Bro018_1027	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; so ; I would think that you might wanna do something like uh you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors .
Bed015_2022	No , by all means , ; right . Uh , sure . ; And so I what I 'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right . ; And when we think we have it right then saying , " aha ! ,
Bsr001_2299	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; That 's a good idea . ; Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in
Bro014_579	but ; Well , let 's say for ins ; see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch . ; So just just for example .
Bmr002_179	Then it doesn't matter , ; Well done . ; See if we care . ; does it .
Bro013_700	um so he does this um method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um frequency resolution . ; So I don't really know the theory . ; I guess it 's these are called " time frequency representations " ; and h he 's making the the time sh um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained .
Bro028_1121	its whatever it finds to be best . ; Um , so you could argue that in fact it ; But I I don't actually believe that argument ; because I know that , um , you can , uh
Bmr023_902	ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data ; and and and nobody happened to mention it to us , ; Hmm . ; and we were getting these , like , really terrible results ,
Bmr024_987	It 's like like dynamic ra DRAM . ; Just before . ; Just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in . ; Yeah .
Bro019_639	OK . ; Um , ; well there are some minor changes , ; yeah .
Bmr025_795	so . ; I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally ; and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads ; and so that means synchronizing the time
Bmr024_1232	Hub - five . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard .
Buw001_582	I mean , most ; th this is one of the larger meetings . ; Most of the meetings we have are four or five people ; That 's true are four or five people .
Bmr014_587	Oh , I see . ; as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1693	Yeah . ; That 'll oughta be a good way to get the pipeline going . ; Oh , I 'd be delighted . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_507	Sorry to have to Sorry I have to leave . ; I will be here full - time next week . ; Oh , that 's fine . ; OK , see you .
Bmr016_1062	and , it 's no problem , right ? ; Yeah , it 's ; Because it 's not backed up . ; Yeah .
Bns001_802	Well , ; could you introduce such a session management , ; or ; Norm - what they do right now is they make it part of the application - level protocol .
Bed013_1291	OK . Where possible . ; where possible . Right ? ; OK . ; If i if if it 's not at all triggered by our thing , then it 's irrelevant ,
Buw001_1561	Yeah , that 's true . ; It it doesn't ; Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " , ; you know , whatever .
Bro021_552	It turned out there was a bug in my Matlab code . ; So I tried it again , ; um , ; and , um , the results were were better .
Bmr009_488	Sure , but tone might be very ; So . ; Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_308	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Right . ; Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh
Bro018_178	but let the net have everything . ; That 's another thing you could do ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1680	It went a little long ? ; I mean , disk ; but ; I think we 're OK .
Bro023_526	so , it 's like ; So it 's the close - talking microphone . ; Yeah , ; the close - talking without
Bed014_963	Could we do Thursday at one - thirty ? ; Would that that be horrible ? ; No . ; Yes .
Bed005_164	OK . ; But all the rest is p simply frosting on the cake , ; and it 's optional for that parser . ; True .
Bro010_816	they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , um , training up a detector that detects for , um , these phonetic features ; for example , um , he presents um , uh , a detector to detect sonorance . ; And so what what it basically is is , um it 's there 's ; at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga I mean , it 's an AND gate .
Bro003_1280	So , I I I don't see how we 'd do it . ; So what I like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do . ; And and all the kinds of data that we , at this point , already have . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_429	But the thing is that , you know , I I I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . ; Yes . ; Well , we had talked about this before ; and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that
Bmr003_892	I should have it finished by the end of the day . ; No , but the thing is the fact that she 's she 's did it before just might give a lower bound . ; That 's all . ; Exactly .
Bed015_211	So this should be semantic and ; Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent ; cuz I 'm not sure yet . ; Here , I actually it was just a mistake .
Bed005_1463	It 's blown up , ; and is a it 's , uh it 's huge , ; but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_788	So that @ @ given that you 're using the VAD also , the effect of the VTS is not so far ; Is not . ; Do you How much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you 're adjusting it ? ; Or how much do you think is intrinsic to ?
Bmr010_293	Yeah . ; In terms of it being Windows versus ; But I 'm just wondering , is ? ; No , no . Praat isn't Praat 's multi - platform .
Bed017_171	and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind . ; And so ; for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . ; And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites ,
Buw001_1111	Too much caffeine . ; That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , ; but then I thought " no , maybe that 's real " . ; OK .
Bns003_90	So Wilbert will set up the second computer . ; Yeah , ; though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a ; I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance .
Bmr015_1008	And I was ; I I don't know , ; I mean we had this an ; and I didn't couldn't get back to you ,
Bro005_1134	And put put them together . ; What what What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean ; I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . ; That you did have nice interpolative effects .
Bmr001_117	Can I have something to write on the back of ? ; So , so where are we in this ? ; Thanks . ; Let 's see , so we now we now have a few mikes that work .
Bmr027_198	Mm - hmm . ; so that we have a uniform thing . ; So , tha that 's a month , ; which is fine .
Bmr023_297	because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working . ; Right . ; And , uh , ; so it 'd be It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could ,
Bmr002_833	Mm - hmm . ; Anyway , that 's that . ; Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ? ; This is true .
Bro017_974	Variance . ; So , when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score . ; I mean it was just , you know , incredibly high score , and so that was throwing everything off . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_184	Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; So it looked strange ; and then just using the the other silence probability helps .
Bmr018_1084	This is just sort of an overall ; So . ; Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech , ; a redo of the HLT paper .
Bro005_1335	Mmm . ; I think so , ; yeah . ; And then , you know , once we
Bed017_727	But for adults and not for the children . ; This was ; Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_799	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Got it .
Bro024_884	I mean , we ; I think when it 's noisy people should just speak up . ; to ; Mmm .
Bmr021_341	The way I recently used it , ; and there might be better ways ; So the program 's called W - encode . ; Mmm .
Bro028_644	anyway . ; Yeah . I 'm I 'm wondering about that ; because there 's this whole issue about , you know , simple tuning parameters , like word insertion penalties . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1916	Yeah . ; You laughed at me , too , the first time I sa said ; I did , ; and now I love it so much .
Bed002_381	So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . ; Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . ; But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . ; And , so that 's that 's the quote " deep " that we 're trying to get at .
Bro010_1240	as we as we have over there . ; If there is ? ; An obstruction between them . ; Ah , yeah .
Bmr028_1502	Oh , sure . Terminology is always context dependent . ; And I i i i ; No question about it . ; It 's just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be
Bmr031_1132	So . ; So . ; Are you using ? ; Which is nice and flexible
Bed003_1673	Ah . ; You know . So . ; Unless it boots up with networking . ; It 's plugged in .
Bmr003_914	Well , but couldn't I do it for the next ; We we we could get fake ; Oh , I see what you mean . ; I mean that 's easy enough .
Bro004_611	Ah , ; Yeah . Yeah . ; OK ; so these are not
Bmr003_1973	No , I think in ; I think both . ; I think mostly internal . ; Mostly in house .
Bro014_308	Mm - hmm . ; Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do . ; It 's just when you when you get all done , I think that they pro ; Yeah .
Bed012_172	We have " where is X ? " is the question , ; right ? ; That would just be Info - on or Location ? ; Based upon
Bmr008_1748	Mm - hmm . ; eh in a moment F - seek function doesn't work . ; Hmm . ; and I had an problem .
Bmr008_115	and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that . ; I see . ; I don't think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads , ; Right .
Bmr009_39	OK . ; Because Jane uh is not here yet . ; Good point . ; And uh she 'll be most interested in that .
Bed005_1177	So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse ; uh , ; eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be . ; And it 's it 's sort of not a great estimate ,
Bed005_1114	OK , so you should take a look . ; OK ; Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life . ; I
Bro004_517	So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that . ; What 's MF , MS and ME ? ; Multi - French , ; So . Multi - French , Multi - Spanish , and Multi - English .
Bmr013_941	You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , ; Yeah . ; and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . ; Yep .
Bmr018_461	Hmm . ; But isn't ; The chopped up waveforms . ; The problem is if if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up
Bmr025_777	or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region ; and they can then look at it . ; So . ; I know we haven't been using it
Bmr023_371	which I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more . ; Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I I planned working on , is , uh , to use the the transcriptions which are done by now , and to to use them as , uh ; Oh . ; Oh , the new ones
Bed004_292	You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . " ; But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what 's going on with the system design , ; and where we think the belief - nets fit in ; and where the pieces are and stuff like that .
Bro025_648	Yeah . ; I thought that was only used for doing frame - dropping later on . ; Um , it is used , uh ; Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping .
Bed003_1392	so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing ; but um um we can sort of ; It has a very clear interface . ; We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn
Bro007_15	There is uh there is the features uh there 's the OGI features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh ; l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow . ; Um those features go through a contextualized KLT . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1418	Right . ; I I agree . ; Yeah . ; They they have several options .
Bmr011_1344	I don't know if this is at all useful , ; but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building ; Yes . ; to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch ,
Bed005_692	or ; I mean , no there 's no end ; to the complexity you can build into the uh , what a tourist in Heidelberg might ask . ; Mmm .
Bro016_118	So . ; I I would ; Yeah . ; I would need to do that .
Bro010_529	Yeah . ; Well , that 's I mean , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s uh , spectral subtraction methods . ; I mean , if if you have , uh , fair assurance that , uh , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , ; Hmm !
Bro021_441	so that 's why we stuck to thirteen . ; Yeah . ; And there is there is also this log energy versus C - zero . ; Sorry ,
Bmr019_614	And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there . ; OK . Alright . ; And then , um , uh , also Dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_666	converges . ; But . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr029_280	So . ; Was that a combination of me ? ; That was both types of meetings , ; but most but there were only two Robustness meetings , and four or five , uh , Meeting Recorders .
Bed012_119	So every part of a structure is a " Struct " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I just uh I just was abbreviated it to Struct in my head , and started going with that . ; That element or object , I would say .
Bmr010_802	I don't know . ; Well , the other ; why don't we do that ? ; But , uh , just to to , um
Bmr020_1881	Mm - hmm , ; What what I would ; and and they 're very it 's very audible ? on the close - talking channels ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_1533	I do too , ; but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that there 's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something . ; Expanded ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_605	Right . ; So the twelve you you it took you twelve hours of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do , ; but but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your ; Twelve minutes .
Bed008_202	S probably does . ; Yeah ; someone has to track that down , ; but I but uh
Bro019_932	If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise , ; Yeah . ; Huh ? ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_1119	Oh . ; To the left ; the one on the left is that Basmati ? ; By the light switch , yeah .
Bmr022_1438	And als it also ; Mm - hmm . ; You can back everything out . ; To your local , or to the global .
Bro017_571	I think it 's about right . ; Yeah , because it de it depends on the weightings ; and ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro023_330	So ; But that 's what I 'm confused about , ; cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering . ; No ,
Bed011_103	They they pick a couple , ; say three uh uh six as a matter of fact . ; Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace ; and um and they have a map .
Bmr031_1615	you know , and that would be a reasonable thing to do . ; And then if it 's really when you look at what y i i i ; Since you 're looking at something that 's sort of in log domain , cepstral is like log d linearly transformed of a log domain , it 's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it 's Gaussian anyway . ; And so the other things that get more more tricky are , uh , to handle the fact that it 's not not really Gaussian .
Bmr025_149	so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . ; Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . ; Hm - mmm . ; Um you have to do preindexing
Bmr012_869	Right . ; I mean I corrected all ; I mean I hand - edited the whole the whole meeting ; so that can be run
Bro013_639	Mm - hmm . ; And um if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be ; Mm - hmm . ; if it was if it was unvoiced or something .
Bmr024_372	Ho - what will they do when they go hear " beep seven beep seven three five two " ; I mean , you think they 'll we 'll get ? ; It 's pretty distinct . ; The beeps are pre - recorded .
Bmr008_90	Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession . ; That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down " speech researcher " or or something at that granularity . ; oh . ; So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is .
Bro022_900	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good . ; Well , I guess
Bro012_641	That 's great ! ; It 's great . ; So we should definitely get something in for that . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1015	If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . ; Oh . ; Hmm . ; It 's like this is not what we meant to research .
Bro027_81	Yeah . ; Is this oh , from the from ; It ; This is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty - four .
Bmr001_600	That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it . ; Oh , it 's just not working . ; I just I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once ; OK .
Bro017_870	And you will compress your test data by square root . ; Mm - hmm . ; Then you will still have a perfect m match . ; Except that this component of C - one will be half as important in a in a overall score .
Bed006_743	Mm - hmm . ; And what we are going to do , ; we going to ; and you can see here ,
Bed008_354	So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . ; OK . ; Right . ; But yeah , that was what he had in mind .
Bmr003_1569	I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other . ; I have a auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal ; That 's a good idea . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1468	Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . ; It 's slightly different . ; Ah - oh . ; So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .
Bed011_481	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed011_66	huh ? ; and so Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . ; So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up , ; and , the kinds of decisions .
Bed012_438	Yeah . ; What what we need is a just a mechanism that says , " Aha ! There is " ; I just don't think a " winner - take - all " type of thing is the ; I mean , in general , like , we won't just have those three ,
Bns001_1530	So ; And if we have other suggestions and eh have this as a long term ; NSA core group activity , ; and this theoretical framework , whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter , in principle ,
Buw001_2086	Um , ; if people were interested they could talk to them , ; but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . ; I think @ @ gonna add that to one of my action items .
Bmr001_699	That 's great . ; Oh , that 's a good point ! ; I know . ; And we 're we have a little problem of no women ,
Bro004_904	Twenty - seven . ; Twenty - seven broad classes . ; So like , uh , ; oh , I don't know ,
Bns001_312	So , uh , at the physical level , they 're they 're they are not compatible . ; It 's not a problem . ; No , but s You could have a UMTS gateway that translates everything to that uh w local @ @ . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2212	That 's that 's been the case . ; So , ; And plus the training , whatever you have . ; I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not ,
Btr002_2578	and I changed it . ; I 'm like " it 's just laughing " . ; Good . ; Yeah .
Btr002_852	right ? ; but it was ; Yeah . ; I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time .
Bed011_331	Yeah . ; It In fact , um , I am just you know today , next couple days gonna start really diving into this data . ; I 've basically looked at one of the files ; you know one of these
Bro005_1127	If we take the approach that Mike did and have ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . ; We have different languages ,
Bmr026_509	but But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . ; I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . ; Yeah . ; Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk .
Btr001_2784	you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence . ; What do they say , ; OK . ; " Each line into smaller groups .
Bmr026_48	We 're doing it in parallel , yeah . ; OK . ; Yep . ; Um and we want it You know , we need
Bro008_74	Somewhere in there , depending on the exact case . ; So ; So that 's good . ; I mean , I think that , uh , one of the things that Hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals
Bmr022_478	so ; Oh , of a of a segment that they 're hearing ? ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1481	Yeah , cuz @ @ uh what I had originally said to Brian was well they 'll have to mark , when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background , ; because I thought that was gonna be the most prevalent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But if we send them without editing , then we 're also gonna hafta have m uh , notations for words that are cut off ,
Bro016_234	Right . ; Mmm . ; I 'll bet you there 's still a lot of insertions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_891	you could actually get something , um uh , uh , get an objective measure . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh ; You mean on on the hand - marked , um
Bmr022_668	Where it is . ; Right . ; If so , if that doesn't add time for them , that 'd be great . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1023	But @ @ ; of the contents , in principle . ; But , I don't see that uh ; It 's too late , I believe .
Bro008_450	Mm - hmm . ; Um , and Um , ; so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh this is a neat data set . ; Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room .
Bmr008_1787	Yeah . ; but eh I I I have the same codes in different parts , ; Anyway , ; and uh I I had to to to change all all the points in the in the code , eh to substitute eh for another way ,
Bed009_589	That ha has all the wrong connotations . ; it 's it sounds like it 's you know stand alone . ; It doesn't interact , ; it doesn't
Bmr026_524	And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " ; So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " . ; Yeah . ; Wa - a I know what they want .
Bmr011_1291	um , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , uh , uh , censored choices , ; we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , ; but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1258	uh ; It 's worse . ; It 's not trained on Finnish , ; yeah .
Bmr019_449	I already tried to get it close . ; Good . ; So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement . ; That looks good .
Bmr012_147	OK ? ; And then also if you haven't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . ; And that should just be one person whose name I don't know . ; OK ?
Bmr024_280	uh ; So , um ; At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . ; And , that sort of , um , is useful ,
Bmr006_899	And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . ; Right . ; And my idea is ; " Tone " , whatever .
Bmr015_1092	Could we get a breath detector ? ; Oh , just to save the transcribers time . ; Well , I mean , you just have no idea . ; I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute ,
Buw001_1874	OK . ; Um , and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh !
Bmr027_974	It 's gonna ; Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ? ; Yes , absolutely . Absolutely . ; Oh , interesting .
Bmr021_134	The one we 're wearing . ; Isn't that something . ; OK . ; And so we had these wired for us .
Bmr019_579	So they are they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type . ; Mm - hmm . ; They 're the twenty - five cent , ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1205	It 's gonna change , ; Yeah . ; and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later , ; Interesting .
Bro024_56	So I think we 'll use as much data as we have at a particular time , ; and we 'll we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . ; But , um , there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models . ; If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data .
Bmr024_400	Just , what do we do with digits ? ; OK . ; We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them . ; Well , we we we wanna have them .
Bmr008_890	OK . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr015_478	Right . ; Yep . ; I see . ; But but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students ,
Bmr013_559	And some of them are , yeah , " uh - huh "s , and " hmm "s , and , " hmm ! " ; " hmm " " OK " , " uh " Grunts , ; uh , ; that might be interesting .
Bed003_728	Are you assuming that or not ? ; Like is that to be I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . ; If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_348	I didn't know that you could whistle that ; OK . ; You 're a very soft whistler , ; you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all ,
Bmr020_977	Yeah . ; Battery . ; Battery ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_676	Good . ; Yeah . You didn't didn't fall . ; Well , yeah . ; That 's good .
Bmr024_53	I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing . ; And also the SmartKom thing should b ; SmartKom also , Andreas . ; Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things .
Bed015_1217	N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were . ; To know how ; Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1447	And and that 's sort of one of the ; all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee . ; Oh ! ; Hmm .
Bro018_1192	Yeah , ; well , it 's it 's not exactly the right thing ; That 's that 's the ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_1150	So from the point of view of the ob of the entity ; Mm - hmm . ; Want to view that , ; yeah yeah .
Bro003_803	but he says those those those Parisians talk funny . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; They have an accent . ; Yeah they
Bro027_721	It 's pretty good . ; It 's it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something . ; Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation ? ; Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got .
Bro021_581	it was two , three weeks for training up for the large Broadcast News test set training set . ; Oh . ; I don't know how much you 'd be training on . ; OK .
Bro012_143	Oh . I see . ; Oh . ; That would be lovely , ; Yeah .
Bmr015_693	eh , ; very much harmonics now . ; Yeah . ; Um , harmonic possi possible harmonics ,
Bro026_866	And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds . ; Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to to generalize this
Bro011_639	Mm - hmm . ; it just shares that state . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up ,
Bmr002_1015	I can't remember which aspect of U of U Penn I was following , ; Right . ; but It must have been the LDC . ; I I I bet you anything .
Bro027_1888	For the tandem net you mean ? ; Well , I 'm ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro017_705	Yeah . ; So you 'd actually ; You have to do bo both . ; Because essentially you are saying " uh this feature is not important " .
Bmr006_941	Unimodal ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So is it just one cluster per ; A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network .
Bmr031_1149	preparing for quals . ; Uh , hopefully second week of September if I can ever get Warren Sack to answer my emails . ; I probably shouldn't say that on the tape . ; Beep .
Bro023_232	just not as much as he would like . ; And so , uh , there 's a higher probability of it making an error , uh , in the first utterance . ; What would be really cool is if you could have ; uh , this probably users would never like this
Bro019_1027	Yeah , yeah . ; Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro018_184	I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net ; because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this ; you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_1060	Huh . ; From , uh , University of Hamburg and Bielefeld . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro004_791	Almost . ; But I mean it it it does give a distribution . ; Yeah . ; It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that uh the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too .
Bmr013_315	And Or " gonta " . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; it could be " going to " or " gonna " or " gonta s " you know .
Bmr023_319	but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . ; Right now they 're in the process of being edited . ; Um , the , um ; Let 's see ,
Bed013_1046	Hmm ? ; And much harder to p to program . ; Yeah . How how do these pieces fit together ? ; Uh - huh .
Bed014_870	Good . ; Oh ! Oh , OK . ; Bullet - proof . ; That 's the word I was looking for .
Bns002_813	OK ? ; Yeah , what I think Maybe some , uh cases why I go this way with my node , and suddenly , I s go out of the scope of the transmission area , ; because it 's really a random movement . ; Then I still hear
Bed009_491	and how that is uh specified . ; I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant . ; Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention . ; And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be .
Bro010_1184	and then there 's the distant microphone signal . ; And you could as a kind of baseline say , " OK , given that we have both of these , uh , we should be able to do , uh , a cancellation . " ; So that , uh , um , we we , uh , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , ; uh , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation
Bmr024_1262	So , um ; And I 'm now , uh , trying the ; Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . ; So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test .
Bed015_1845	Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; Uh . ; M mockery .
Buw001_180	but So . ; You So we won't have to go through that . ; Hmm . ; I have a question on protocol in these meetings ,
Bmr028_463	Yeah . Otherwise , it 'd be a good idea . ; Yeah . He popped in . ; But , I mean , he 's basically gone . ; Oh , OK .
Bns001_1268	give the providers like KPN or whatever , the po the potential , in principle , to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks ; because there 's a three g third generation like UMTS , a fourth generation more IP related . ; There will be a fifth generation , I 'm sure . ; And then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network ,
Bmr011_1810	and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . ; Is that right ? ; Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2040	someone currently doing the video thing . ; It would really be interesting . ; Yeah . ; Cuz I know it was mentioned .
Bed010_589	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , ; so I I I ; It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .
Bmr030_142	Not the slide show . ; because that 's the standard way of doing it in Windows . ; Yeah , he didn't ; But of course he doesn't use Windows .
Bns001_1042	uh ; Well , users usage . ; I never saw a user using WAP . ; Please raise your hand , who is using WAP .
Bro028_403	and see does that is that does that make the difference ? ; Uh - huh . ; If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say " OK , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . " ; Mmm .
Bsr001_1831	I heard a " sh " . ; IBM . ; Yeah . ; So we 've been we 've been trying we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects
Bsr001_1979	Mm - hmm . ; Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_539	Ah ! ; So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . ; So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space . ; Eleven hours ?
Bed013_216	that 's that 's nothing for those neural guys . ; I mean , they train for millions and millions of epochs . ; So . ; Well , I 'm talking about
Bns001_1296	s ; It 's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone . ; So that is eh overall picture that we have in mind with these things . ; And we can not u
Bmr019_1200	or ; And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels ; and we sort them by time . ; And then there 's a then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts .
Bns003_33	So the point is how long I will stay . ; I believe , a couple of months definitely ; and based on the success , I think that 's always an ongoing process to go back to uh , to Germany for a couple of weeks ; and then come here and and go on with with this work
Bed015_1065	cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . ; And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . ; For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . ; I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that .
Bns003_776	and I would like to go on with the QS in advance mechanism ; and , uh , ; in the relation of USAIA I also have the activities with Georgia Tech . ; They have now a PHD .
Bmr025_396	to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . ; I mean it 's different . ; So that 's ; I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data
Bro004_243	Around one point four ; yeah . ; OK . ; And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ?
Bmr020_1874	OK . ; Sample it , rather . ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_601	So there 's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time . ; You know what I mean ? ; There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels ; Across all of them .
Bed012_907	Or Cantonese , as the case may be . ; What do you think about that , Bhaskara ? ; I mean ; Well
Bmr024_1069	I think that 's a good idea . ; Right . ; Oh . ; OK .
Bed003_876	OK . ; Let Let 's do a ; Can we add , just so I can see how it 's done , uh , a " has door " property ; or ?
Bmr008_411	I don't know . ; Well , the thing abou the reason , uh , one reason for putting " Optional " might be if it uh , made the form seem gentler and k and not as intrusive kind of thing . ; kinder and gentler . ; Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd I shouldn't say that .
Bmr020_432	Yeah . ; Cuz again , looking forward to the non - close miked case , I think that we s still ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'm not looking forward to it .
Bro012_64	I don't know in the in the STRUT implementation of the stuff is there a high - pass filter or a pre pre - emphasis or something in the ; Uh . I think we use a pre - emphasis . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_67	I logged in there and I tried to import ; Yeah ? ; It worked good ? ; Yeah , it works .
Bdb001_42	So , we have this , um ; I think a starting point is clearly the the channelized output of Dave Gelbart 's program , ; which Don brought a copy of , ; Yeah .
Bro005_316	Eighty - nine . ; eighty - eight . ; Yeah . ; Well , there are minor minor differences .
Bro028_1201	Should we do our digits ; and get ou get our treats ? ; Oh , tea time ? ; Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them .
Bro019_165	Mm - hmm . ; Um , how do I do it with " run command " ? ; I mean do ; You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job
Bed008_83	or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . ; When . ; How . ; Yeah
Btr001_566	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Um ; S
Bro003_592	I have ; Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that . ; But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there . ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_1030	but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because um I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard . ; This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions ; Oh . OK . ; or very close .
Bmr015_662	Yeah . ; and count on accuracy during the sparser phases . ; Yeah . ; Cuz there are large s spaces of the
Bmr003_2616	But if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Oh .
Bed013_1028	I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way , ; and probably not practical . ; Yeah , e ultimately that 's also what we wanna get at . ; I think that 's that 's the correct way .
Bro016_1059	Yeah . ; Huh . ; From , uh , University of Hamburg and Bielefeld . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_488	So this is word word error rate , ; so a high number is bad . ; Yeah , this is a word error rate ratio . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_524	yeah . ; Nein . ; That 's right ! ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1628	So . ; OK . ; Well , we 'll talk to you about it Uh ; Well , should we e should we switch off the g
Bro014_219	Oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora participant sort of thing . ; For ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed009_303	Mmm . ; uh the the two levels will be as far as I 'm concerned as uh standing here for the generation module ; Mmm . ; and the other is is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be
Bed003_1032	Or ; Yeah , right . ; n uh ; Let 's see .
Bed011_1163	So , if we all decide it 's a good idea for you to go then you 'll we 'll pay for it . ; Right . ; Sure . ; Then you can go .
Bmr014_901	from somebody else , as you say , ; you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . " ; Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . ; I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like .
Bro018_857	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But ; yeah
Bro018_647	And you get that for each class , you get a zero or a one . ; right ? ; right . ; Right .
Bro005_711	Yeah . ; But if you can do good normalization it 's it 's uh OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1581	they trained on American English ; and then they tested on , uh , different native speakers from different areas . ; And , uh , ; uh , the worst match was people whose native tongue was Mandarin Chinese .
Bmr012_136	Yeah , that 's true . ; Anyway . ; I still don't see the problem . ; Either way
Bro012_123	So they they look at ; OK . ; Yeah , look at a ; So it 's ,
Bro007_267	Yeah since these ; well also just to know the numbers , ; or ; Yeah .
Bmr008_183	I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that , if you don't know about the meeting ? ; yeah ; Where 'd This is just Well , you know , we 're we 're talking at at a general level of description . ; yeah
Bro010_1183	and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal ; and then there 's the distant microphone signal . ; And you could as a kind of baseline say , " OK , given that we have both of these , uh , we should be able to do , uh , a cancellation . " ; So that , uh , um , we we , uh , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it ,
Bns002_1040	I mean , as our routing approach , for nodes that are closer than this practive area . ; OK ? ; and eh , well , ; u e a
Bed017_249	i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , ; that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . ; And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , ; and then plan a route .
Bed017_508	Mm - hmm . ; So . So something something very specific that you can then ; But the I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries . ; Mmm ,
Bmr022_666	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Where it is . ; Right .
Buw001_2099	and ; intelligent - room sorts of things . ; Oh , really ? ; It 's those guys .
Bmr005_485	And I I found that eh another thing . ; When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , ; um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file , to to transcribe , the the events and the words , I I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh collected by headphone . ; Yep .
Bmr007_853	Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks . ; All of which are definitely acoustic events . ; They 're definitely someone talking . ; But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing .
Bro017_965	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN . ; We were playing with putting um pitch into the Mandarin recognizer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_902	Yeah . ; I wanted to do something very similar to the proposal as a first first try . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bmr008_383	I think people decide uh , in that moment . ; I I think people in Speech are gonna wanna ; Because if you put " Optional , " I think you you give eh ; They 're very strong - willed .
Bro003_931	we will have . ; Oh yeah , ; we can we can test on s Spanish . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2144	Oh , I guess we 're not done . ; that , um , Thilo requested , um , that we ge get some segments done by hand to e e s reduce the size of the time bins ; Yeah . ; wh like was Chuc - Chuck was mentioning earlier
Bro021_668	Hmm . ; OK . ; How about you , Sunil ? ; So , um , I 've been , uh , implementing this , uh , Wiener filtering for this Aurora task .
Bro028_344	LPC ? ; Twenty . ; Right ? ; I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech .
Bmr013_93	No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . ; So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . ; OK . ; And so , um , I mean , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order .
Btr002_1381	Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; and things covering several screens ; and it 's just horribly i inefficient ,
Btr001_49	Yeah . ; One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms . ; Um , because there are so many ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_94	Um , pretty much , yes , ; but I think it 's a little bit more complex . ; As , if I understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes . ; So , when we input something , we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these .
Bmr018_1228	If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here , ; then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro010_1056	Placing stuff , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bmr012_718	Well we , ; I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it ; hopefully it will be fairly quick ; but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on
Bro024_1139	yeah , there are two figures showing actually the , mmm , um , performance of the current VAD . ; So it 's a n neural network based on PLP parameters , ; uh , which estimate silence probabilities , ; and then I just put a median filtering on this
Bmr031_589	Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also . ; Two or three ? ; If you use both sides and the two layer and all that . ; It 's a lot more than that .
Bmr019_842	We don't care what what tool you use . ; Yeah . I mean , if if you can , um if you wanna ; OK . ; I used it in Transcriber
Bmr010_861	Does that matter ? ; Yeah . ; Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing . ; Um , and that 's , uh I don't think that we can do very well with that .
Bns001_279	Mm - hmm . ; I was thinking that um as a well , not really a UMTS service , but yesterday , what I discussed with Joachim was uh , a w little bit based on your ad - hoc networking also . ; That it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from w a WaveLAN Technology to , um , UMTS . ; I think that 's , uh , it 's in in the future that will be a main competitor of , uh , of UMTS ,
Bed016_215	OK ? ; Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here ; and so ; of course , I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide ,
Bed010_1009	Well , we we 're connected to uh ; Yeah . ; There 's a there 's a a very significant connection between ; We 'll we 'll go through this ,
Btr002_2549	a sort of like a sup uh , an uh , an elevated " hmm " ? ; I hadn't thought of that . " ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro021_356	which is a huge leap . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bed002_128	OK . ; So th ; Um . So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder ; and there are lots of different aspects of the project .
Bmr019_1740	Yeah . ; eh , and e i I mean , if , eh , the topic is , eh , so difficult , ; uh , in my opinion , there isn't ; Yeah . Maybe somebody else will come along and will be , uh , interested in working on it
Bmr003_1405	and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that . ; Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr016_1141	So on the fifth page , seven down ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! ; Alright so , a spelling check first ; then an exhaustive listing of the , uh all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached
Bmr010_40	Well , it 's a it 's a big improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; I would prefer this .
Bed015_320	And I think that 's just fine . ; Which is fine , yeah . ; It 's that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , ; Yeah .
Bmr012_943	Oh yeah ; there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that ; um ; well well it 's sort of related
Btr001_2211	Oh . ; Oh oh oh , yeah , OK . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_713	Yeah , but actually the well well the well - matched ; um , ; uh , ; I mean the the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits
Bns002_643	Yeah . ; Yeah , a cellular phone and a car . ; but it has not enough power to transmit something that can be heard here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_679	or is i are they sort of competing techniques ? ; Not seen . ; They are very s similar techniques . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_877	because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; and you won't get very very clean models from them , anyhow .
Btr002_2993	Mm - hmm . ; then indicate what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized , uh , parts when there are words involved , ; Mm - hmm . ; just to set it aside ,
Bro008_269	Yeah , so that 's that 's that 's what ; That would be ideal would be is that they could , you know , they could actually show that , in fact , a combination of some sort , uh , would work even better than what what any of the systems had . ; And , um , then it would it would , uh be something to to discuss in the meeting . ; But , uh , not clear what will go on .
Bed002_672	in some shape , way , form over the other , ; Yeah . ; to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data . ; Right .
Bro005_1221	Yeah . ; So , yeah , but we 've ; I don't know . ; We have to get some reference point to where we
Bmr008_728	so it 's I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out , ; For now . ; That 's true . ; Washington and stuff , yeah .
Bmr010_1458	Yeah . ; Couldn't you have a third category ? ; So you have , uh you have , uh , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ? ; He has this on his board actually .
Btr001_1608	So , ; like , I I change time bins a lot , ; and I like will change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_663	I mean , that 's th We had this back and forth a little bit about , you know , are sites gonna are you gonna run this data for different sites ? ; And , well , if if Mississippi State runs it , then maybe they 'll do a little optimization on that parameter , ; and , uh ; But then he wasn't asked to run it for anybody .
Bro026_812	That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and ; Yeah . ; And there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . ; So just you can see all this mails in the ISIP web site
Bmr011_254	Great , great . ; So I think just do a field trip at some point . ; Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about ; Yep .
Bmr008_312	Mm - hmm . ; Could we put one more thing on here maybe ? ; That 's what I want to talk about in a ; Yeah , I 'm I have that as a topic , also .
Bmr016_129	so sixty - one w is read as six one , ; Mm - hmm . ; and if people make a mistake we ; How about " O " versus " zero " ?
Btr001_2227	Yeah . ; And " or " tends to be used with questions more than So . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_1810	Yeah . ; OK . ; there was a category for @ @ speech . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_1084	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob um promising features and look at them in pairs , uh , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of " OK , I now have uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1410	And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . ; Well , just just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_973	Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days . ; No , they 're super . They 're the they very quick . ; OK . Turn the mikes off and let 's talk . ; Yeah , I know . I am I 'm serious .
Bdb001_403	Uh ; I mean , I 'm not sure what to do about this with ATLAS , ; because they chose a different route . ; I chose something that
Bmr022_72	For ; Oh , oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; I didn't just say that , no .
Buw001_527	and they email it out for minutes . ; I mean , that happens in most meetings . ; I I I think that , um , there 's we 're using " summary " in two different ways . ; So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " .
Bro019_1307	Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech , ; I mean . To maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds ? ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_779	when you say , uh ; So ; The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ? ; Yeah .
Bmr001_558	I what I 'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel . ; Right . ; Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle sixteen bits . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1321	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Yeah , that 's a good idea . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3237	And I think those are interesting , ; so when I find that I I note note it as , you know , finishing ; put capital letters . ; Capital letter , capital letter , colon , apostrophe " S " , utterance .
Bed015_673	So we used to use the notation " with " for this ; and I think that 's closest to their second one . ; Right . ; So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it .
Buw001_1733	so they can click on an utterance and hear it . ; and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions ; which you got a copy of today . ; Right . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have ,
Bro014_1031	but how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed spectral envelope ? ; Wha - wh i i uh , how is that , uh ? ; Um , we just ; How did we do it up again ?
Bmr014_643	OK . ; Good . ; Um , let 's see . ; I think the uh
Bmr031_803	So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff . ; Uh , transcrip ; So you 're we 're you said it was almost half , ; so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours
Bmr003_653	i b To not do anything until we get money is is ridiculous . ; Right . ; Right . ; Right .
Bdb001_86	and then " ID equals T one , uh , one seven " . ; And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp . ; Right . ; Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program ,
Bsr001_301	I mean , but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer . ; And this , eh , eh but this is designed to be worn like this to be worn like this . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_25	Should we plunge right into it ? ; Yeah . ; So , would you like to ; I think so .
Bmr015_758	but but uh uh uh , ; I would , uh ; I mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something ; but but then , given those guesses , try ,
Bed004_130	OK , good question , but uh ; you you just wait and see . ; It 's You 're gonna l learn . ; OK .
Bro003_1688	yeah . ; OK . ; And , um , also , if you have sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do . ; And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it .
Bro024_58	But , um , there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models . ; If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . ; Or we could , um , use some other amount . ; So like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test ,
Bed015_1662	Uh - huh . ; And so , yeah , I mean ; Yeah . ; So that that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah .
Bmr031_171	Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well . ; n ; Yep . ; Right .
Bro011_211	to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . ; and we have some the feature for Italian database ; and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_323	Yeah . ; Hey , whi what where are @ @ ? ; Yeah . ; What are you doing ?
Bmr016_467	yeah , like that . ; OK . ; It 's gonna require some coordination . ; Then it would go like h twice as fast , or a third as fast .
Bns002_582	But one of the ; So ; if they ; Because of this wall , if they are not neighbors , well , we can represent this putting this node like here .
Btr001_800	Yeah . ; Right . ; Got it . ; Sorry .
Bed013_581	Yeah . ; Um . ; That would be hard . ; Well I uh maybe it 's just four thousand lines .
Bmr011_1727	Which uh ; I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , ; Hmm ? ; but who knows ?
Bmr029_588	and and then early next week , do these . ; If we had enough machines , maybe do them in parallel . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that by the middle of the week we had s had some kind of result .
Bns002_1564	Yeah . ; So , ; But take a look to the slides , I will uh deploy it um uh electronically . ; Wher - where your slides are available ?
Bns001_1280	They are discussed since , you know , ten years or whatever . ; The specification are rather stable and and available ; but we have only islands in that . ; We cannot assume that everything is end to end available .
Btr002_3314	OK . ; um , this this was u when it was used ; They used " mumble " for ; exactly .
Buw001_2038	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , I just as as as a contributary ; eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping .
Bed006_1250	like Source - Path - Goal or force , whatever , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; Right .
Bro017_242	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice . ; Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis
Bed008_815	So Keith this is gonna get into your world ; because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties ; Mm - hmm . ; s
Btr002_605	That , uh , I mean , you know , one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have , ; but we 've got good microphones ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Btr002_1723	Exactly . ; Exactly ! ; cuz I can whistle so high . " ; Wow .
Bro026_489	I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bed017_453	Trying to to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , ; um , what you can do with those . ; Um . ; What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this
Bmr022_849	Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; So should I just go do that ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_4	OK . We 're on . ; OK , so uh had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis . ; Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also ; so uh the PDA mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at at uh five hertz
Bmr028_686	How about during the picnic ? ; Ah . ; Yeah . I 'm sure he 'd appreciate that . ; Yeah . I 'm sure he 'd love to
Bns002_12	And maybe Jordi , you have a few words concerning your work ; one or two sentence ; and because we will have tomorrow a talk from him in more detail concerning what 's going on . ; Eh , you you want me to say
Btr002_1706	Oh my god ! ; Wasn't that a kick ? ; No ! ; I did that .
Bro012_452	Yeah , it was actually updated . ; OK . ; Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago ; Oh , it was .
Btr001_2295	It 's a different kind of shrug though . ; I feel like it I feel like it sort of , um , asks for somebody else to , uh , put input in now . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro018_158	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a clever thing to do .
Bed006_40	Yay ! ; Um , apart from that , sort of the old gang , Johno and Bhaskara have been with us from from day one ; Hi . ; and um they 're engaged in in various activities , some of which you will hear about today .
Bed003_597	wait . ; That that doesn't uh ; it 's not really consistent . ; They don't discuss the admission fee .
Bmr023_895	So that someone e until someone else fixed it , ; which is that , um , I never put ; when I u ; We had some problems before with offsets .
Bro003_1488	thanks for bring it back to that . ; My th I want to clarify my point about that that that Chuck repeated in his note . ; Um . ; We 're over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place ,
Btr002_461	Mm - hmm . ; It 's very very surprising . ; Very surprising . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_710	I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? ; Oh ! Probably not . ; A permission form ? ; Has Don have you s did you si
Bmr031_791	I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well . ; But the University of Hawaii has issued a request . ; Yep . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . That that needs a month ,
Bed015_1174	So " path " , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . ; Mmm . ; And you know , " container " that you can go in and out . ; All of these things .
Buw001_165	Let me , uh , turn that off . ; Oh . PZM nearest , nearest , next nearest . ; Next one . ; Next nearest .
Bro023_1062	Yeah . ; Uh , so , it 's , uh , three point , uh , eight . ; Uh - huh . ; Am I right ?
Bmr012_1142	yeah . ; that 's a good idea ; Infinite expansion . ; Right .
Bmr018_497	And then you would switch into the other ; so . ; But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying . ; Right .
Bed011_541	Yep . ; I mean , Go - there is is a yes or no . ; Right ? ; Yep .
Bns003_766	Of course . ; but , you know , sometimes , especially in the in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open ; and , well , it it is something that can be changed . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1305	Really nice . ; I mean , people didn't ; Yeah . ; uh , I mean , people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT
Bmr020_701	I 'd hafta add him to Meeting Recorder , I guess , ; he prefe he said he would prefer FTP ; but ; OK .
Bro012_1374	and see if giving the d uh , this voicing bit would help in in terms of uh frame classification . ; Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ? ; Mmm . ; Yeah , but but B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing .
Bed008_747	Sure , but other I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , ; right ? ; the ; right
Bmr010_216	Is there a a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ? ; No . ; No . W w we originally we did that ; Yeah . It was IS two .
Bed017_715	But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , ; something that is of great social value . ; He said , " for example " , ; this was his only example ,
Bro028_108	Yeah . I 'd like to see that , ; cuz maybe I could think a little bit about it , ; cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller ; or I mean , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all .
Bmr006_641	And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . ; Um , someone deleted something somewhere .
Bmr011_846	Yep . ; Yeah , ; y right , ; Mm - hmm . Then there 's their web site that has lots of papers .
Bro016_896	You know , ; so it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; But it but , um , i it it could be that when you say it works maybe we could be doing much better ,
Btr002_911	Yeah . ; I just drag the line . ; See , I never I never do that for some reason . ; I don't do that either .
Bed017_294	I should say . ; Yeah . ; but I don't remember reading how you specify ; Right .
Bmr031_816	Um . Yeah , ; except I I 'm tethered . ; D d do we care ? ; He 's tethered , yeah .
Bro027_152	Even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . ; Mm - hmm . ; The signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . ; Hmm .
Buw001_1213	Mm - hmm . ; And ; Maybe . ; Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem .
Bed015_1790	I read some of that paper actually . ; Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ? ; Yeah . ; What ?
Bns002_968	That 's that 's the idea . ; However however , and ; uh , it is always some however , ; uh by applying this uh greedy mechanism , in in
Bmr019_1764	You e you have , eh you are lucky , ; and you you find a solution in in in some few tim uh , months , eh ? ; OK . ; But , eh , I think it 's not , eh , common .
Bmr010_1407	I thought it ; Maybe I 'm misremembering , but I did not think it had a Markov ; Yeah . ; I gues I guess I don't remember either .
Bed005_75	N . ; You happy with that ? ; Well , yeah . ; There 's one tricky part about ,
Bro018_505	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah and a short short amount of time , ; just to again , just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phones .
Bmr009_179	It 's just number of frames . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro016_653	I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back . ; Maybe other people did too . ; With with , uh , uh , l trying to identify third formant average third formant using that as an indicator of ; I don't know .
Bed005_289	but I don't know where it gets it from . ; " See " . ; Oh , " see " . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1139	Wow . ; Well , I bet if you used this one the two s most separated P Z ; Well , maybe , maybe not . ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bmr001_142	Right . ; That 's ; Do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ? ; We need to do that .
Bmr022_82	Hunh . ; Wasn't that what you said ? ; Sort of a text template , ; but I don't know how we can do that .
Bns002_1134	So , for example , you could ask to u nnn , the network to transmit your packet with the lowest uh global uh consumption ; or with your lowest local consumption , for example . ; OK ? ; I mean , would the option for me to to use less power when sending a packet is to send it to the closest neighbor .
Bro027_608	What if you used a smaller window for the delta ? ; because ; Could that help a little bit ? ; I mean , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to
Bmr020_1130	I see . ; so . ; Yeah . ; That would be more natural
Bro008_439	Yeah , ; right ? ; And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_1750	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI .
Bro018_5	So . ; so you get to ; Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_903	that 's right . ; So so whether the corrections take too much time . ; That 's right . ; I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them .
Bed003_1115	I I saw directory called " source " , ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; I didn't e
Bmr031_1293	Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah . Actually we had this ide from the last time that they were here , that it 'd be nice to have UW do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically ; Can I borrow a piece of paper ?
Bmr016_1188	And with all these things being in curly brackets ; so they 're always distinctive . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , I also wrote a script which will , um , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym ,
Bmr013_609	I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . ; Oh , great . ; I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . ; OK .
Bro026_391	Yeah . ; And what if we didn't do that ? ; Would we get worse performance ? ; I think it doesn't affect it ,
Bro026_295	Hmm . ; Put them together . ; Uh . ; So if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gonna freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ?
Bro023_869	There can be frequency bins with negative values . ; OK . ; And so when you say you 're adding something that has the overall shape of speech , is that in a in a particular frequency bin ? ; Or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ?
Bmr002_716	Yeah . ; Well , ; Yes , ; although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between .
Buw001_195	Yeah . ; OK . ; I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , ; and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us .
Bed015_643	OK , so how is it ; so " designate " FrameNet ? ; Does that Is that really what they mean in in ; FrameNet ?
Bmr016_479	but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , ; OK . ; I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session , ; yeah .
Bro022_1225	I mean , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? ; Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are ,
Bmr010_901	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you could you could say well , let ; we now think that laughter should have three sub sub sub - units in the the three states , uh different states . ; Yeah .
Bro024_522	And so it 's it 's not it 's not actually very consistent across . ; So . ; The only correlation between the SpeechDat - Car and this performance is the c stationarity of the noise that is there in these conditions and the SpeechDat - Car . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1986	But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? ; Hmm . ; turn off ; I don't think we should have rules of participation ,
Bro021_249	like during fricatives or during speech pauses . ; And , ; uh ; Yeah , but you 're still getting more recognition errors ,
Bro023_410	and again , that 's the ba the ten point , uh , four and twenty point one . ; That was with on - line normalization and LDA . ; So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it . ; But the
Bed014_1453	I can't wait to hear this . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh , definitely . They have , like , places instead of like Yeah , instead of karaoke bars now that have , like , DDR , ; like
Bmr030_839	What are they called ? ; What are they named ? ; Yeah . ; Oh ! I 've forgotten now .
Bmr007_61	Um . ; Sort of off - topic I guess . ; Cuz that 's Cuz that was all all about the , uh ; Oh , OK .
Bed006_447	Right . ; OK . ; Then I suggest we move on to the to ; we have um uh the EDU Project ,
Bro012_543	Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something . ; No . ; No . ; OK , so um I guess the argument one might make is that , " Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it .
Bed006_969	So you have constraints that are dependent on the c actual s specific filler , uh , of some attribute . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; W ; Yeah e exactly .
Bro008_412	Does a any you have any thoughts about what else y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ? ; Uh ; Oh , f a lot of thing . ; Because we trying a lot of s thing ,
Bns002_1349	And on the other hand , what are the billing implications of this behavior ? ; Because it is clear that , well , when I 'm only uh , talking to the to the base station of my provider , well billing is more or less straightforward , ; but what happens if I 'm working uh , let 's say , uh across a mall , and at a given moment I 'm using the small base station of a cordless phone that is inside the shop I 'm at the window of ? ; Well in this case , I 'm using a resource which is not owned by my provider .
Bmr012_900	it 's in the monitor so it 's ; Mmm . ; Thank God it 's not more than that . ; So
Bmr019_248	It 's in in fact , we looked it up ; It is wide - band . ; OK . ; and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .
Btr002_1902	Oh , yeah . ; You did an excellen excellent job . ; That was really it was like m transcription , a meta - transcription and meta meta meta . ; Oh , thank you .
Bro016_1093	And , uh , ; um , ; called them " avents " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1564	Yeah . ; And th and that 's for a good meeting . ; Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've you 've had some more trouble with ? ; I can't really hhh , Tsk . I don't have really representative numbers , I think .
Bmr008_525	and you know when you talk about dialects in England , I mean , that 's really ; Well ; Every block of London has a different ; Hmm .
Bns002_212	OK ? ; We are ; uh I think I 'm not telling it yet , ; but we are assuming that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes .
Bmr024_871	So . ; Soon . ; I think I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines . ; And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once .
Bmr003_1467	Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech , ; was sort of the way I felt @ @ ; right ? ; Well , yeah ,
Btr002_323	And then especially if you 've got a pause following it , ; but you don't always y ; these things are correlated but they 're not perfect . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1646	That was sort of son ; Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . ; That 's much simpler . ; I don't know what they said
Bmr011_1458	OK . ; but ; Oh . ; Right .
Bro014_1600	OK . ; We can talk more about it later . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1497	Well , it sort of was . ; was it w was it word - sense ? ; But it was it was a very simple case of " to " versus " too " versus " two " and " there " , " their " , " they 're " ; Yes .
Bmr009_1497	It 's not slow at all . ; I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_516	I mean , they can just limit the number of people . ; Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was ; but it was smaller than ours . ; Well , that might help a bit .
Btr002_2418	But this is somebody somebody differ ; He must do this in a lot of meetings ; because I think you know , I 've run across it several times . ; I don't think I 've ever heard it .
Btr001_1867	Mm - hmm . ; Right , ; Mmm . ; yeah .
Bro024_1113	Alright . ; So you have w w one sheet ? ; This one is you don't need it , ; alright .
Bmr010_386	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we discussed on some methods to do it . ; My approach originally ,
Bsr001_746	And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . ; OK . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr001_745	And then we can assess it . ; Yeah , the the problem of course is that it 's you know , in in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts , potentially . ; Well , Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , ; No .
Bmr005_381	be ; No no , but I think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? ; Oh . ; Oh .
Bed006_1532	Pastry ; oh ba oh the bak bakery example . ; Bakery . ; This is the bakery example .
Bns003_753	sure . ; M uh , maybe you sh ; Sure . ; I think it 's pretty healthy for a student to to have a project , eh , where you have to write actually some part of research
Bmr023_1032	or ? ; That 's what we did . ; Right ? ; OK .
Bro021_495	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; And then renormalize . ; Mmm .
Bro014_937	the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; but it 's more that , you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data
Bmr023_1204	Yeah . ; And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ? ; As you should never do worse . ; I I , uh , missed what you said .
Bmr026_1112	Oh ! ; That 's what I said . ; I 'm sorry . ; It 's w
Btr002_1171	Excellent . ; Yeah . ; OK , so i ; It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute
Bmr005_941	that that you wanna go with . ; Can I just ask about the data , ; like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , ; just cuz I 'm
Bed005_416	Oh . Oh . ; e mmm ; Um , well i ; There is a feature called " Discourse - Status " ,
Bmr018_592	But , yeah , if you take ; I it wasn't ; It was bimodal . ; So if you
Bro004_1117	They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature . ; Does does anybody know how they 're using it ? ; Yeah . So so what they 're doing here is , i ; Yeah .
Bed005_1266	Which is The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this . ; So that Uh , if you know about it let 's say , a particular town hall that , it 's one that is a monument , then , that would be stored there . ; If you don't , you look up the hierarchy , ; Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode .
Bmr027_341	because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . ; And so someone whose machine is down or whatever ; I mean , we have no ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1054	I mean , I 'll start if you want . ; I 've been , uh , most recently rewriting Transcriber in Java for no particular reason . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed017_595	Alright . ; Uh I don't know , I mean the uh ; I mean I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program . ; Hmm .
Bro024_717	m ; w ; But the but the , uh , forty - seven point nine percent which you have now , that 's already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal . ; Yeah .
Bed013_218	So . ; Well , I 'm talking about ; Oh , I was gonna take a drink of my water . ; I 'm talking about billions and billions and billions and
Bmr005_995	now that uh the things are starting to happen . ; So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , ; but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is gonna grow ; uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately
Bmr005_676	but ; but eh I think we need eh eh more information . ; No , of course . ; I expect you to find more overlaps than than Jane
Bmr010_1158	um ; It could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something . ; Something like that . ; Maybe an elaborate one ,
Bed014_336	But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems . ; One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings ; and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , ; you know , between let 's say between the past and the present ,
Bmr018_1012	And it 's like , " Who 's Ryan ? " ; OK . ; Yeah , good question . ; Well , Ryan could come .
Bed011_499	And uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a " attend " et cetera . ; Attend , ; yeah . ; So it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things ,
Buw001_1092	uh ; If can we turn that just that that let ; Uh , let the record show the light is flickering . ; The fl the fluorescent light is flickering .
Bmr010_531	Right . ; I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_388	This is not on the web . ; A ; And this is not on the web , ; No ,
Bed015_2028	Yeah , that 's ; Yeah . ; Can can we , uh What are the generalizations , and stuff ? ; Connect the dots .
Bmr021_153	cuz that would be an easy place for , uh , an error in the data . ; Yep . ; For it to be forgotten . ; Well , it 'll be me
Bed016_335	Mm - hmm . ; End of story . ; Anything I forgot that we should mention ? ; Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff .
Bed002_332	uh , uh , uh ; My suggestion is really simple . ; We start with , um ; Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing .
Bmr003_695	and ; And ; so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . ; D does uh this tool you 're using is strictly
Bmr010_1210	e I mean , I I I did sort of a a rough pass on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , uh , transcribed meeting ; Mm - hmm . ; already transcribed meeting . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_147	Four thousand lines . ; And each line is between one and about ten digits . ; Four thousand lines ? ; I didn't I didn't compute the average .
Btr002_2651	like the next bin will be empty , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then it 'll be " breath " . ; Oh , I 've
Bed016_1014	What ? ; Yeah . Essentially , yeah . ; OK . I was like , " Huh ? ; It was here . "
Bro023_1244	that 's another another way to go . ; How did it compare on I mean , for for good cases where it it uh , stuff that it was trained on ? ; Did it do pretty well ? ; Oh , yeah ,
Bro003_354	but that 's the image they have , ; right ? ; So that 's that 's ; I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years .
Bed003_847	Or " not public " and " not a door " are equivalent things , ; it seems like in practice . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed010_837	so , um And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , " is there an ontology API that that " ; There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies ; and we build the parser and stuff around that , ; or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so For example , is there something that we can use there .
Bmr029_772	Um . Can you repeat the question ? ; Uh , whe when you trained on Macrophone , um , to do those digits experiments , did you use the entire Macrophone corpus ? ; There wa it is a subse ; Yeah .
Bmr009_446	So . So . ; or a sort of , a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals . ; Yeah . ; I mean .
Bmr008_1483	Something , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bmr007_1074	Then ; Yeah . ; " what are you nodding about ? " ; The question is , like whether
Bmr016_1530	What are those ? ; So it they said that @ @ ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_510	Yeah , but ; S b ; Again , it 's the kind of of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it didn't work . ; And , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps .
Btr001_641	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; I was just gonna say something . ; I was gonna say that ,
Bed002_845	there . ; That 's ; I don't know . ; I but y I don't think you really move ,
Bmr018_579	But , you know , we th that may not be true . ; It may be just some of the segments they 're just doing a lousy job on . ; So I 'll I 'll listen to it and find out since you 'd actually split it up by segment . ; Right .
Bmr009_653	Yeah . ; Well it 's a sliding window , ; right ? ; So if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece , you know , there 'd better be some something .
Bmr022_282	Great idea , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; No , two is probably better than what I was suggesting ,
Bro012_879	Gotcha . OK . ; Sorry to interrupt . ; Yep . ; But the the uh but let me as ask ask you something .
Bed010_614	Oh . ; Oh . ; Not really . ; Great .
Bro018_320	Mmm , I think late uh I think in the summer sometime . ; Hmm . ; So . ; OK , thanks .
Bmr022_999	so we have , you know , some kind of little something , ; and , uh , we have a wireless connection , this board , that 's doing the computation for the f the , uh the recognition . ; And so , you know , we wanna be able to show off to somebody , ; you know , we have a base station somewhere ,
Buw001_200	Well , that was just one of the reasons . ; But , yeah , definitely . ; Yeah . ; OK . Good .
Bmr009_1441	Alright . ; Yeah . ; It 's I 'm s I ha ; Well . Well . I mean , pure
Bmr030_848	A what ? ; A r ; P - make stuff . ; P - make magic .
Bmr019_95	it shouldn't have been as surprising as I as as I felt it was . ; The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . ; And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking . ; Exactly .
Bed003_108	right , ; there 's gotta be a reason for it . ; And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . ; The context , which in this case we 've limited to " business person " , " tourist " , or " unknown " ,
Bmr012_1132	You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer . ; It 's not a bad idea . ; No that no no ; that 's a very
Bsr001_1115	And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well . ; OK . ; And you 're saying some of the infrastructure is , um , the A T - andT video conferencing . ; The infrastructure , yeah , they th they were paid
Bed006_760	and that 's what I just thought he was doing . ; You look up here . ; OK . ; Sort of between here and here ,
Btr001_1567	that somebody 's already done , ; Oh , how interesting . ; and ; But , I mean , it 's still It 's still cool .
Bed002_1068	and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , ; that are contained in the data , ; um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features ; and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them .
Bro010_482	I have asked people why ; and they shrug their shoulders and say , " oh , it works . " ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_140	We we were guestimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time , or something ? ; So , if there 's thirty hours of data , you can calculate that he can do , uh , the enhancement in a day ; u ; and something .
Btr002_1285	And so it shows , ; I mean it 's it 's useful . ; This is this is why we do these digits . ; It 's a nice standard task ,
Bmr027_452	uh , uh , uh uh , ; you know , like dead - beat dads , ; they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery ; and then they open the envelope
Bro005_1233	I mean we may find that we we 're not really gonna worry about the M L ; You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in . ; Mmm . ; If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP .
Bed006_816	whereas source is just an attribute ? ; Is that ; No , no , no . ; Source is just not spelled out here .
Bed014_1129	Yeah . ; Yeah , now , we we w ; We had to we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work . ; Great . OK .
Bmr020_1462	OK . ; And , you know , then they 'll send us back what we w what what they send back to us , ; Oh , that 'd be great . ; and we 'll we 'll fix things up
Bmr016_243	Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . ; And I think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , ; and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , ; which were done by non - native speakers
Bmr031_1535	Um , I also recently wrote a script , um , that , uh , generates the kappa statistic , ; um , which is a for labeller agreement . ; Um , so , been looking at that as well . ; Yeah .
Bed006_839	uh or or and the Trajector should be coming in there as well . ; OK . ; And then G the same about Goals . ; OK .
Bmr016_855	OK . ; So , ; the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal ; because disks don't crash very frequently ,
Bro014_790	but having , um , e using also MSG features . ; So there is this KLT part , which use just the standard features , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro017_712	yeah . ; So for each uh set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ? ; Yeah . ; But but wait a minute .
Bmr011_830	And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation . ; Is is ; Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? ; I don't remember the acronym .
Bmr024_1532	Right . ; Uh ; And , uh , with this , I have to leave . ; Hmm !
Bmr018_1684	and , ; you know , the there 's arguments on both sides , ; Yep . ; I think the matters is the thing that that was misleading .
Bro010_1120	right . ; and and , uh , ; and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think . ; I 'm definitely interested in this area , too ,
Bmr005_1297	There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends , ; and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , ; right ? ; If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @
Bns002_602	If if if I can hear you , you can hear me . ; Mm - hmm . ; and and the opposite works also . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1588	and then we will hav ; Yeah . Then we 'll know . ; We we had I mean , ; Thanks .
Bed011_102	And um And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . ; They they pick a couple , ; say three uh uh six as a matter of fact . ; Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace
Btr002_836	Mm - hmm . ; and dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it , even . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1228	Well , so it 's a reference performance that we can you know , if we want to to work on the VAD , we can work on this basis ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; OK .
Bed003_296	from the uh ; Well i it 's ; From the utterance ? ; Hmm .
Bed005_247	So , if you want to look at the templates , they 're conveniently located in a file , " template " . ; Um , ; and this is what I had to do . ; I had to change , @ @ " Spielfilm " to " film " ,
Bro003_1556	So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers . ; Right . ; Yeah , I 'm not sure what 's available on ; is it
Bmr022_1137	rather than just them just going in and correcting it . ; Well I p At this point ; Well , with CVS , though , you don't actually have to do it that way . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_882	I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , ; Right . ; so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . ; OK .
Bed013_789	Mm - hmm . ; And since there 's never a bad idea to document things , no ? ; That 's th that 's definitely a good idea . ; That would be my , uh
Bmr023_241	That 's a great idea . ; Does it sound OK ? ; Yeah . ; So , um Yeah . We just used those .
Bmr019_1478	Anyway . ; OK . ; I think we 've we 've covered that one up extremely well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_155	Because , ; Well , no I guess not . ; Excel ; s
Bro021_1269	Yeah . ; So this changes the whole mapping for every utterance . ; It 's not ; Yeah .
Bns002_1513	Yeah ? ; Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it , ; and I got the statement ; uh they are very interested in that .
Bro013_62	OK . ; Still . ; Mm - hmm . ; But but uh what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take
Btr001_1313	So do I have a Tigerfish one right now ? ; Hmm . ; If it says " TF " . ; If it says " TF " .
Bro004_1204	and then it 'd be OK . ; Ah . ; They they clearly did actually remove silent sections ; in order because they got these word error rate results .
Bro003_230	Oh I see , ; so your point is that it 's it 's it 's uh the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions . ; So you ; Yeah .
Bdb001_193	For word - level , it 's alright . ; Definitely . ; Mm - hmm . ; For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just I don't know .
Bmr010_379	Yeah . ; S OK . That 's that 's a good point . ; Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer , ; Good .
Bro003_919	right ? ; Ge - At the final test will have German . ; Well , so , ; yeah ,
Bed017_44	Once again , ; right , ; together . ; Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while ,
Bed009_198	and we noticed that first of all what are ; I should 've brought some slides , ; but what our ; So here 's the tower .
Bro027_189	And then ; When are his prelims ? ; Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . ; Oh .
Bmr006_41	um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , ; th the guy that was at the last meeting . ; Well , great . ; Great .
Btr001_662	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened . ; Oh yeah ,
Bed002_307	I I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it . ; So , this is sort of how people may , uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . ; And we get tons of of these " how do I get to " , " I want to go to " , ; but also , " give me directions to " , and " I would like to see " .
Bro003_1089	uh , if you have all of these nets trained some place , then , uh , you can combine their outputs and do the KL transformation and so forth ; and and , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; So , what it it blows out is the number of uh testings .
Bro025_727	And , um , so , those are interesting things to ; So you 're now you 're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features ? ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_73	Yeah . ; and we get the transcript back ; and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , ; then uh we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch ,
Bmr016_1819	So . ; Uh , that 's what gets I I picked those up in the frequency check . ; Right . Right . ; So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue ,
Bmr012_350	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Cool . ; there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different
Bro023_1556	Mm - hmm . ; which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector . ; So even if there are no no speech pauses , you can track the noise level . ; The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least .
Bmr018_1426	A lot of different ones . ; this was the last day , ; R I think ; but , I mean , there 's that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field ,
Bmr028_1256	Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ? ; I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that . ; I think most of them are pretty good . ; No . I mean if suppo
Bed010_252	Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , ; what 's the ontology look like , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know what do the constructions look like ,
Bdb001_829	I guess that one 's actually easier . ; What about ; what about , um , the idea of using a relational database to , uh , store the information from the XML ? ; So you would have
Buw001_1523	You know ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , ; but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings .
Btr002_2258	I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful , ; so we sort of screen it out . ; Yeah . ; u all these different in
Bed016_1150	Yeah . ; Also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example , ; We ; so , even temporal references are
Bed002_730	No , no . ; But ; No . ; OK .
Bmr030_272	There 's a median filtering and then there 's a piece - wise linear fit , based on some criteria . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 'm not sure .
Bro010_902	You get enough of these detectors together , um , then you have enough information to do , um , higher level discrimination , ; for example , discriminating between phones ; Mm - hmm . ; and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer .
Bro024_814	I also have the feeling that um , the reason ye why it doesn't work is yeah , that the models are much are t um , not complex enough . ; Because I actually I als always had a good experience with spectral subtraction , ; just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when I was using neural networks , big neural networks , which maybe are more able to model strange distributions ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_619	Right . ; So it 's connected . ; Yeah . ; And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working .
Bmr024_632	or , is is that our data which we are collecting here , ; We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . ; or ? ; OK .
Btr001_1833	There 's one guy in particular who does that . ; It 's really cute actually . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh
Bro011_552	Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task ; and see how that affects things . ; And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , ; this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system .
Btr002_1468	It 's where you have it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting . ; So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along . ; Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1058	Right . Even with one microphone . ; So you know , even if you only have one ear , you can still get get good transfers . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_813	But ; if we can go from ten X to five X we 're doing a big ; We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway . ; Right .
Btr001_912	I always get confused with the pronunciation convention . ; Sorry , what was this ? ; I get confused with pronunciation , like when there 's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark . ; OK .
Bed013_484	No no no no no no no no . It 's it 's like a ; Oh , it 's cognitive . ; OK . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro023_875	Ah ! ; OK . ; I gotcha . ; Right .
Bro013_786	Everything 's fine . ; OK . ; OK . ; Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it .
Bmr023_469	And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page ; Oh , great . ; so we can keep people updated about what 's going on . ; Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane
Bed015_764	or " he did walk to the meeting " as opposed to " he didn't walk " . You know , ; Mm - hmm . ; so we need to have a notation for that ; which , um ,
Btr002_2661	I see what you 're saying . ; Yeah . ; it 'll be three d sort of separate units as opposed to I think it 's sort of one coherent thing . ; Yeah .
Bro010_847	Well , actually , ; yeah , ; so I was using EM to get the targets . ; So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output .
Bmr023_1055	Yeah . ; so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . ; Which could be good or not . ; Yeah .
Bro011_699	I was just gonna change the the t ; Mm - hmm , OK . ; Yeah , just work with the models , ; yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens .
Bmr005_1337	And Mari also , ; we had This came up when she she was here . ; That 's important . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_378	it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o ; So then maybe we should try to bring people here . ; I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . ; Here .
Bmr022_1419	but not everybody can check it in . ; Right . And there 's some happy medium ; Yeah . ; and we don't know what that is yet until we get feedback from people ,
Bmr014_549	But ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . ; And um ; And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? ; Is that right ?
Bed009_175	Mm - hmm . ; The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone ; OK . ; even though all the recording is done here
Bed015_1318	Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; even though saying that place takes place , whatever .
Bmr009_1037	Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess . ; I think a lot of people ; Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1098	but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos . ; Um , a number of people have done this ; so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . ; So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach .
Bmr009_822	Yeah . ; I always assumed ; So the time is supposed to be pretty exact , ; because I 've just been taking beginning time time of the meeting .
Bro003_1963	Superclass . ; Instead of the the the the superclass thing , ; which is to take ; So suppose y you don't really mark arti
Bmr023_398	Yeah . ; I talked to Helen . ; And and and she was ; And so , I asked her
Bmr016_136	I mean , because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from OGI . ; I 'm sorry , ; digits numbers training that we have from OGI , ; we 've done lots and lots of studies with that .
Bed002_310	but also , " give me directions to " , and " I would like to see " . ; And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data ; That was the wrong one . ; um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference .
Bmr002_733	um They subdivide into WAVE files ; and then they give for each , they give a one oh , you know , a WAVE file that g indicates where the start and stop times are , ; Mmm - hmm . ; and then um and then give the uh whatever the sentence information .
Bmr006_1190	Yeah . ; Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . ; Yeah . ; But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is .
Bed009_1028	Mmm . ; OK ? ; And and we could you could do this . ; And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know
Bmr025_77	Excellent . ; and let them work on that . ; And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? ; Yes ,
Bro012_846	And the variance is just sort of like the next moment , ; you know ? ; So uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times , ; another time it went thr
Bns002_1015	because if not , well , it 's difficult to to perform comparisons uh between one protocol and another , ; a different one . ; But anyway , now what we have is is two basic approaches to this this problem . ; Eh , mainly what they call the practive protocols
Bmr003_2531	PC card , ; so you can have a slot , ; PC card . ; right ?
Bed011_866	I I ; OK . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_59	IRAM , bigram , ; Bi - Bigram . ; Yeah , let 's let 's see where we are at three - thirty . ; you know .
Bmr022_256	because then you could have them actually transcribe " H - beep " or " L - beep " , ; " high beep " or " low beep " . ; And then when we get them back , if we see two L - beeps in a row ; It would be much easier .
Bmr028_1129	Wow . Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . Then you can do like an you can estimate the the noise estimates .
Bro028_956	The I think it 's a two - stage idea . ; And , um , the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral auditory system . ; And I guess that is like a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . ; And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , um , PLP .
Bed017_189	Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . ; And that would basically it 's just another class in the model , ; with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . ; And then , after you group them together this
Bro004_122	Different lang ; So um If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't have the numbers in front of me ,
Bed005_268	" this " and " see " are not optional . ; " Want I like " is all maybe in there , ; but may also not be in there . ; So so , the point is , if it says " this " and " see " , it also will work in " see " and " this " ?
Bed008_1171	uh ; well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place ; what rule of combination is used there . ; So th yes they so these things all affect it ,
Bmr028_1371	but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box . ; And it 's not a very smart system . ; It it only knows what we give it . ; And if w If it knows more than we would really give it when it runs , we call it cheating .
Bmr007_746	But , uh ; The chairs are Chairs are movable . ; Put them Like , put them on the table where they ; The chair Yeah .
Bns002_106	For instance , what I have in mind , you have a car , where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other , for instance , ; but one device decided to go to the G S M network or GPS network , or whatever kind of things . ; That 's OK . ; So there 's a certain kind of task uh , for one node within the ad - hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world ,
Bed012_165	And if it 's If ; Well now , y I mean , you could ; And i if there 's sort of a clear winner here , ; and , um and this is pretty , uh indifferent ,
Bmr030_623	Half a gig . ; Really ? ; That big ? ; Oh , no , wait .
Btr001_1763	Yeah . ; but it 's not a actual laugh , ; Right , ; but like
Bns002_1456	and that means uh six universities and and institutions ; uh , three in USA and three in Europe . ; and of course , they are uh including the NSA group ; and maybe that seems to be very reasonably , for me .
Bro019_250	and it 'll find another machine , ; the fastest currently available machine ; and and run your job there . ; Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make ,
Bro021_1062	That one 's right . ; Mm - hmm . ; One and ; S uh , i th we can put here the set transformation .
Bed015_386	yeah . ; And so that was the ; Robert 's not happy now ? ; No !
Bmr019_141	Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too . ; Uh - huh . ; Much the same thing , ; and and it was
Bmr030_779	OK . ; Um , because there 's gonna be data coming from UW , hopefully by then . ; Cuz u ; I just hate not to get data .
Bro004_1435	I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff , ; but ; Yeah . ; Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff , uh what do we do , large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem systems .
Bmr005_1255	And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh ; Right . ; Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . ; And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile
Bmr008_1739	I 'm not sure . ; Yeah . ; What was the bug that you found ? ; What the bu
Bro019_1605	but they are lower in energy ; But there 's some of that , ; yes . ; and Well they are much lower .
Buw001_1978	Oh , yeah . ; Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , ; I mean , we were discussing this earlier , ; that depending on the task
Bed002_584	i like business or travel , ; as well as the utterance context , like , " I 'm now standing at this place at this time " . ; Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , ; which is what you have as context ,
Bmr011_1772	And and he also , he was ; The energy , ; Yeah , ; right . Exactly .
Bmr009_1574	And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening . ; OK . ; And it 's also also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing is proposed to the ; Hmm ?
Bro016_133	I just need to get , um , front - end , uh , stuff from you ; Hmm . ; or you point me to some files that you 've already calculated . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_361	But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um ; Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . ; There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have . ; So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful .
Bmr018_692	Hmm . ; And it looks And so I looked at all of the utterances from you , Chuck , in that one conversation , ; I don't know which You probably know which one I mean , it 's where you were on the lapel and Morgan was sitting next to you ; and we can hear everything Morgan says .
Bmr011_458	They don't have the t the transcription standards . ; Are they going to do video as well ? ; They don't have the ; Hmm .
Bro022_307	Yeah . ; Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? ; Or you just tested on this ? ; Uh
Bmr005_50	Yes ? ; Uh - huh . Yeah . ; You mean that as an event also . ; So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that
Bro026_98	You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . ; OK . ; Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS ; and I 'm just wondering Uh , I mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that .
Bed016_1039	It 's another ; Yeah . ; So we 're thinking about , um , ; or we could also think about ,
Bed015_1741	just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , but about linguistic hedges ,
Bns002_143	Um , is that really an ad - hoc network ? ; Because the sensors are not moving . ; And I think it 's makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are . ; Yeah .
Bed003_189	but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Bmr028_1492	And then then , even if you know that , can that help you ? ; I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ? ; Hmm . ; And so that was important to know as a baseline .
Bro027_332	and then this they 're going to run some evaluations . ; So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr007_1295	Thank you . ; I meant to say that before I started off on the Switchboard stuff . ; I was gonna say " can you do that for the other meetings , ; It 's neat .
Bed010_1028	I 'll let you know . ; S I 'll send you email . ; OK . ; Yeah ,
Bmr014_1046	I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . ; I I ; At least it more often . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1417	You would think that would fairly trivially ; the training would , anyway , ; th the testing uh I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well . ; But I think that you could certainly do d um , distributed , sort of Ah ,
Bmr023_1095	E Eric coached me through then that part of it , ; so I 'm pretty confident in that . ; OK . ; I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated
Bmr019_1992	Yeah . ; He had the the long form . ; No . ; And we 're off .
Bns001_1302	if Hannes come , ; We are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh w in the few years or whatever ; what the whole internet community has um done in in si since uh since a decade . ; But we can f pick up some f some um potential and and and to start with something .
Bro021_234	Hmm . ; uh ; So would that be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time ; or ?
Bed002_1229	and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um this data file . ; So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .
Bro027_2033	Oh , right . ; Right . ; Um ; Mmm . So it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings ,
Bmr016_1734	And then , following that is " QUAL TCL " . ; Oh I see . ; I f I forget , ; OK .
Bmr002_222	so that the person transcribing can tell where one ends and one begins . ; OK . ; And ; So , a short sentence between each line .
Bmr007_616	Well , Liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , um If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . ; You wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say , in Switchboard data .
Bmr015_493	who , uh But he he he won't be in the country that long , ; and , ; maybe another will end up . ; Yep .
Bmr009_252	But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots ; because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions . ; Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1711	Well , so he he says well IP to IP or end to end IP , is far well , it 's far away . ; um ; So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there ; and just do uh I Ps playing over radio .
Btr002_1540	Yeah . ; Right . ; Because ; So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter ,
Bmr021_403	Someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time . ; So . ; But there 's also some ; I guess
Bmr005_741	Right . ; Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the ; Well , that 's ; That 's what I was gonna bring up .
Bmr011_1721	and Dave . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed006_742	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And what we are going to do , ; we going to
Bed015_727	basically this is the information structure . ; OK , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus ; Mm - hmm . ; or that there are things like , you know ,
Bed008_82	you could have all those values for Go - there ; or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . ; When . ; How .
Bed008_827	We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . ; Of of course . ; Identified that ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1506	Mm - hmm . ; oh uh - huh , ; w as you move . ; As you play , as you move , as you scroll .
Bro027_580	which is um , delta and double - deltas , ; OK . ; which is fifty milliseconds . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_941	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , something like tha with their cell phones , ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1518	Yeah . ; but i i i ; You mean the bigger the company the more words they use for training ? ; Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it .
Bro027_1785	Yeah . ; Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact ; i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_337	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; you know , each person who 's interested in I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . ; Right .
Bmr028_1244	Tran ; Hmm ? ; Transcriber will export STM . ; Oh .
Btr002_1732	Yeah . ; I think those are interesting . ; Yeah . ; And I think it 's really cool when people
Bmr019_223	Hmm . ; So I just cut it out . ; You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1529	Question mark is punctuation . ; What are those ? ; So it they said that @ @ ; Oh .
Bmr031_1341	Mm - hmm . ; Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms , ; actually it 's it 's it 's not bad . ; You know ?
Bmr024_970	So you 're just saying put them on C Ds for normal access . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_958	So a pointer a way to really say pointers . ; Basically references from the roles in the schema the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha uh I 'm assuming . ; Yeah . ; OK , yeah .
Bro023_857	Um ; Speech - shaped ? ; Yeah , ; so it 's a it has the overall overall energy ,
Bmr019_139	OK . ; Yeah . ; Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too . ; Uh - huh .
Bed002_427	People won't want to enter it . ; Pe - people don't wanna enter them . ; And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it . ; s b
Bmr001_803	I bet it isn't , unless it 's really close to right . ; Yeah . ; I have just because it 's such an un ; The transcribing is sort of something I can imagine doing , whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some very wrong bits in is sort of a less less easy thing to do .
Bmr016_189	read it single . ; It 's just easier to read . ; The spaces already bias it toward being separated . ; Right .
Bed017_353	That 'd be nice . ; Mmm . ; Anyway . ; So . So there i there are some some u uh , you know , uh , elaborations of this
Bmr020_1605	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well then , we really should just send the stuff . ; That would be great .
Bmr003_1511	because he was in the other room talking . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2417	No , ; and he he had , reque @ @ ; my my proposal is you have a laptop . ; No .
Bmr007_33	Um Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go , ; and ; Right ? ; That was that was sort of the point .
Bro019_692	So there 's nothing on ; I don't understand that . ; I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion , ; Yeah .
Bns002_877	Hmm . ; others that are a little bit far away ; and finally , these neighbors that are in the in the frontier of your of your coverage area . ; OK .
Bed016_293	Oh ! ; OK . And so forth and so forth . ; Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , ; and how we solved it ,
Bmr028_885	Mmm . ; Right . ; So , it may not ; I mean , it 's gonna be bad ,
Bdb001_1016	True . ; I 've used the P - file , I think . ; I 've looked at it at least , briefly , I think when we were doing s something . ; What does the P stand for anyway ?
Bro019_427	that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . ; Mmm . ; They 're going to give the endpoint information . ; I see .
Bed014_1150	Right , a little substi substi ; You know , that 's what text substitution uh macros are for . ; Yeah . It 's good for you . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1759	Mmm . ; OK , ; shall we , uh , do digits ? ; Yeah .
Bro004_303	Yeah . ; Downs ; Right . ; So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test .
Bmr006_286	Yeah . ; another type of meeting . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr003_1137	Yeah . ; Let 's get it over with . ; Talk slowly but with few words . ; And clearly .
Bro011_543	Mmm . ; Uh what 's next ? ; I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . ; Oh .
Bmr007_88	Same idea ? ; But , same idea . ; So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , ; so Basically , um as you know , uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap .
Bmr026_515	And put it where ? ; Right . ; but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . ; I mean does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and
Bro013_68	is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed010_449	One is you design and the other is you learn . ; OK ? ; So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess . ; OK .
Bdb001_1140	then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel , ; or you can say that it was , um , a usurping of the turn , ; or you can you know , any any number of categories . ; But the fact is , you have it time - tagged in a way that 's independent of the , uh , sp particular time bin that the word ends up in .
Bmr027_696	Do you have to do the other close - talking ? ; as well as all of these . ; Yeah . ; Wow .
Bro028_1180	Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ? ; Yeah . ; So , it seems to me that , you know , if you take away the the the difference of this primary features , and , say , you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use P - RASTA - PLP or something for the the primary features , um , then this feature discovery , uh , uh , thing is just what he 's talking about doing , too , ; except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these uh , uh , what these sub - features are are are are showing you .
Bed008_1336	So we 've assumed equal weights ; whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh ; X - one matters more i than X - two or ; Right .
Bro010_1054	Oh , OK . ; So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . ; Placing stuff , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_586	Is another problem . ; Um . ; Yeah , there is th this fact actually . ; If you look at this um spectrum ,
Bmr027_713	and then ; Overlapping . ; So , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep . ; So what I really think is " bleep "
Bmr007_558	Yeah . ; Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting . ; So so ; Yeah .
Bro028_426	So , what what do you mean exactly by putting back the pitch in ? ; Because ; In the LPC synthesis ? ; Yeah . You did LPC re - synthesis
Buw001_1641	And so , uh ; How about if I just c ; Uh , Right now all I want ; I personally only want text data .
Buw001_1227	Hmm . ; Right . ; Right . ; and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer ,
Btr002_715	Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely . ; Yeah . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_590	Oh ; or this is ? ; Oh . Yeah . ; It 's not written anywhere .
Bro018_790	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No . ; So um have you had a chance to do this um thing we talked about yet with the uh
Bmr009_1446	Actually , I like that a lot . ; OK . ; Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do , ; the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are .
Bro011_89	We should have a look first at , perhaps , the modulation spectrum . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Um . So there is this ,
Btr002_3258	So it 's important to have the colon here ; Oh . ; because that 'll make it possible to easily know , you know , who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was . ; The problem with
Bed003_717	kinda thing . ; OK . ; So the " tourists " node should be um , very consistent with the context node . ; Right ?
Bro019_715	uh , ; I mean the the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits ; where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also . ; It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something .
Bmr029_172	Right . ; So . ; W s so is Morgan , is the plan to just pick one of the far - field mikes ? ; Yeah . Yeah . We did .
Bmr009_1614	anyway , shall we do digits ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Let 's do digits , ; uh , and then we 'll turn off the mikes , and then I have one other thing to discuss .
Bmr022_713	um ; cuz I was gone last week , ; but but Don had told me that there 's a difference in some of the conventions ? ; Oh . Yes . But this is not important .
Bed015_1359	Yeah . ; Situation . Right , right . ; in in our in our s terminology , " want " can be an action ; and " what you want " is a world .
Bro027_285	I I d ; You asked me to write to him ; and I think I forgot to ask him about that . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_245	I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same the same speakers . ; Well , but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question . ; I just mean that it 's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't that you don't have disjoint sets , ; Right .
Bro025_14	Yeah . Almost . ; We already made it into one . ; Oh , good . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_66	And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ? ; Uh , July fifteenth . ; July fifteenth . ; Oh , so they have a plenty of time ,
Bmr030_247	and it 's all like , aligned and stuff . ; Ah , great . ; So you see , like , the F - zero contour ? ; Yeah , so you see the pitch contours
Bro014_1209	So , I mean , i t t ; I see . ; I mean , to first order what you 'd what you 're doing ; I mean , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies .
Bmr009_177	Frame energy . ; Except that it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized . ; It 's just number of frames . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1003	and and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo - speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo - speakers . ; And that turns out to work very well on Broadcast News , SPINE
Bed008_1494	No . ; Right . ; OK . ; And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything
Bed006_493	Wait , what what are the days ? ; April twenty - sixth to the May fourth ? ; Yeah , something like that . ; I 'll probably be here .
Bro022_437	I mean , if you are recording it through a mike . ; I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . ; Yeah . ; But this
Bed013_235	Yeah . Yeah , that 's big . ; Cuz you have to query the node , for every a uh , or query the net two to the twenty times . ; Sure . ; Alright .
Bmr006_467	and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . " ; No , I think that 's a great idea , actually . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro019_922	Yeah . ; and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . ; Yeah , right . ; I was only half kidding .
Bmr002_1272	Mm - hmm . ; Me . ; I want those things to work . ; And so I would like to get that done as quickly as possible .
Bed011_203	Hmm , hmm . ; And ; Yeah The the reason why we did it that way , as a as a reminder , is uh no person is gonna do all of them . ; They 're just gonna select u um , according to their preferences .
Bmr016_1668	Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . ; That 's kind of disturbing . ; Yeah . ; That 's that 's I looked for that one .
Bmr001_480	right ? ; Yeah so it might be four . ; Right ? ; But it wouldn't be sixteen .
Bmr030_662	OK . So I think we just gotta let things slide for now , ; and see see what 's gonna happen . ; Yeah . ; Nothing else really to do .
Bro018_1059	Yeah . ; Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions ; and and ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1514	Those we won't be able to change . ; If someone says " Hey , Roger so - and - so " . ; Right . ; So that 's gonna stay that person 's name .
Bmr023_764	The ; I didn't I didn't notice . ; There were a little ; the relative number of
Bmr001_764	So so they they 're gonna they 're gonna have to make speaker assignments or something like this . ; They 're going to have to make speaker assignments , ; and wh and which recording are they gonna listen to ? ; For one of one of @ @ .
Bmr031_825	Oh . ; Yeah . ; or completed transcription , ; and it also includes , uh , checked .
Bmr003_1798	So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit ; OK . ; It was horrible . ; OK .
Bed011_52	One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . ; Then we need to figure out what influences its choices ; and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . ; But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today .
Bdb001_262	Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the ; That 's not that not ; long pause phones . ; Yep .
Bmr024_1010	So so then , if So so then , let 's ; It has nothing to do with the meeting . ; So . ; It 's just the general ICSI back - up system is becoming saturated .
Bmr002_798	Mitre , ; That 's the Text Encoding Initiative . ; Oh . ; That 's a way of marking mark - up .
Bed011_932	Well that too , ; but um You know if th if we in if we you know , make sure that we get them talking about temporal order . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_659	Well ; Yeah . ; Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . ; So my my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , beginning and end point .
Bro021_900	Yeah . It 's the same . ; you just mean the log of the of the one up above . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1693	Wh - uh , the the VAD what ? ; We have the VAD information also available at the back - end . ; Uh - huh . ; So if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes
Bro026_740	You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . ; Uh - huh . ; For the most part it 's it 's Gaussian mixtures . ; Oh , OK .
Btr002_116	So , uh , it was transcribed as " with H " , ; but it was really " with age " . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bns001_1181	Yeah . ; You have , in one scenario , multicast , quality of service , routing and mobile um networking . ; Yeah . ; Ah .
Btr001_2473	that 's that 's ; Huh , OK . ; It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_711	Oh ! Probably not . ; A permission form ? ; Has Don have you s did you si ; I thought you did actually .
Bed015_1593	Mm - hmm . ; And so , i ; Yep . ; it c it it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure .
Bro003_1406	And , ; Hmm . ; I don't know what . ; I ask e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that ,
Buw001_37	So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . ; Were we gonna do digits ? ; OK . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? ; I think that
Bed008_897	in terms of uh uh you know , whether whether you wanna go there . ; The time of day , ; right ; I well , right .
Bro018_758	C ; Do you get out a uh a vector of these ones and zeros and then try to find the closest matching phoneme to that vector , ; Mm - hmm . ; or ?
Bro027_1799	So ; It may not be it ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_569	but there must be something wrong , ; I mean , ; unless our ; Well , Morgan and I were were having a debate about that .
Btr001_1771	but it 's still a laugh . ; you know ? ; It 's No , like , ; yeah , it 's like .
Bro004_229	If we call that " one " , then what you 're saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using uh different training data than you 're testing on , say TIMIT and so forth , it 's one point one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , it 's around one point one . ; Right .
Bro017_342	but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz . ; So it 's really w ; It 's sort of like saying that what 's happening at one kilohertz depends on what 's happening around it . ; It 's sort of relative to it .
Bro024_176	with the the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples ; and , um , I 'll I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad . ; Mm - hmm . ; I guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds .
Bmr014_812	OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ? ; I I think ; Or what ? ; Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking .
Bro024_1859	Yeah . ; To use clean speech . ; Uh , ; Yeah , I 'll try .
Bro016_1003	Ye ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1329	Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf " ; Uh ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_632	And actually , ; um , I I didn't anticipate this ; so I that 's why I didn't give this comment , ; and it I this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date
Bro022_729	Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh you 're also training on all the data . ; That 's right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's
Bmr031_1442	Um . ; Well , we 're mostly looking for places where the person 's frustrated with the system . ; So , there 's just two categories , frustrated and not , ; or ? No .
Bed003_757	it is . ; So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then " unknown " as an actual value . ; Yeah . ; What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable ,
Btr001_2154	And I found that really interesting , ; and I was curious to to figure out when that happened , ; if it happened in certain occasions and whatever , ; and I never really got around to it ,
Bed005_188	Ge - elaborate , or , more or less , uh ; Actually , it 's a little tricky , in that there 's some allowable German orders which aren't allowable English orders and so forth . ; And it is order - based . ; So it it
Bmr005_1383	I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , ; just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ? ; But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and ; No , I meant ,
Buw001_1021	That could be very interesting . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_791	Always @ @ . ; Yeah , yeah . ; But that 's OK , ; you know , it 's kind of it 's fair enough .
Bed003_1490	They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak . ; Really ? ; Their reputation is very bad . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro023_1634	I , um , also implemented a sp um spectral whitening idea ; which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal . ; Uh , the idea is just to um , flatten the log , uh , spectrum , um , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher . ; So in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise
Bro023_1193	So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before . ; Yeah . ; Um ; Yeah ,
Bed015_1755	Yeah . ; But it 's something ; Um . ; Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ?
Bmr020_894	Yeah , sure . ; Makes sense . ; So , uh , and that will get around the problem of , the , you know " one word beep , one word beep , one word beep , one word beep " . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_921	Uh - huh . ; Oh , interesting . ; Ah ! ; OK .
Bed006_1006	you know I do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all f tell the rest of the system " hey this person actually wants to go there " ; and " B " , that person actually wants to buy something to eat there . ; Nuh ? ; And if these are two different schemas ,
Bro024_336	And ; and then later you might have somebody else who 's using it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1420	He on only train ; Oh , OK . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential ; Yep . ; Yeah . It was only Gaussian .
Bed014_1269	He 's been around . ; Yeah . ; OK . So has he been been involved with this , ; Just maybe not today .
Btr002_2114	I would also be really aw aware of w how I was speaking . ; Hmm . ; Yes ! ; Cuz I also tend
Bmr021_941	yeah . ; And that that 's quick to do . ; So . ; I was thinking about tandem system
Bmr022_323	was that two beeps ? ; Um See , they have th Brian said the setup that they have is , um ; uh i um ; They 've got headphones
Bro023_1672	Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , uh , this other estimate . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it could be it could be interesting . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_338	and we 're not using the digit data now , ; but you know ; Oh , you 're not . ; Not for adaptation , nope .
Bro023_1147	I mean , it 's not clear that these musical noises hurt us in recognition . ; Hmm . ; We don't know if they do . ; Hmm .
Bed010_383	Is it free ? ; Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I it seems to ; Uh , it may be free to academics . ; Like I I don't know .
Bmr025_269	So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats , ; Yeah . ; so that 's all going pretty well , ; I think we 'll be OK with that .
Bmr003_1399	or a uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that . ; Why , that 's ; That 's not something I wanted to have happen . ; No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for m for video or for audio where you you need to do this ,
Bro018_407	I think , given at the level you 're doing things in floating point on the computer , I don't think it matters , would be my guess , ; Mm - hmm . ; but . ; I this more or less anything
Bns001_463	So ; It can be done . ; It is just Mmm uh Trying to to to to poi to pinpoint The the possible problems . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1336	I think so , ; yeah . ; And then , you know , once we ; Um , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about
Bro023_716	pick one . ; yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . ; VA Yeah , VAD . ; w Yeah .
Bmr024_811	Yeah . ; We 're about we 're about half halfway through our disk right now . ; That was one of our concerns . ; Yeah .
Bro007_581	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it . ; Yeah . ; Uh if you can fit it in .
Bmr014_446	so man So many ways that error prone . ; Right . ; Right . ; So , um , um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments ,
Bed003_1430	and it it 's fifty steps , ; Mm - hmm . ; huh ? ; just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter ,
Bns002_707	Is it not possible then , if I send something and I could not find any neighbor because one of the cluster below , ; This is the next . ; Yeah , th ; is it not possible to extend the power until the maximum
Bmr026_1128	Yep . ; I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from ; Mm - hmm . ; What about uh hidden unit size on this .
Bro022_792	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; But I don't know . ; Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation .
Bed002_216	So this is the idea . ; Um . ; We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , I think we we will agree on that , um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , ; and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling .
Bed010_1057	I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . ; It 's a design problem . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro028_85	Uh , but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size
Btr001_2614	Sometimes they don't . ; Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well . ; Oh , really ? ; You don't have to ?
Bro027_507	after that , um , you have the um , filtering of the silence probabilities . ; Which is a million filter ; it , ; and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay .
Bed005_1223	Right . ; I mean i You could have , ; uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max . ; Well , the " OR " .
Bmr021_129	I see . OK . ; OK . ; Oh , I see . ; So this isn't Sony .
Bed008_1471	OK . ; Yeah , but that 's my question , ; like how do we I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , ; or endpoint sub uh you know s S ?
Bed011_979	OK . ; Yep . ; Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when . ; OK . OK .
Bro012_1181	and ; So go ahead . ; Um yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream ; well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have
Bns003_991	Work packages . ; Sorry , sorry , ; heh ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr026_1041	It 'll still probably be worse . ; I mean , it 's it 'd be context independent and so on . ; No . ; Sure .
Bmr022_522	Oh , I ; So . ; Well , and the other thing is , maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process ; Yeah .
Bns001_1244	Not on everything . ; That 's not true . ; But we s ; That 's why we say here , that we have a certain kind of eh possibility to change in the access networks .
Bmr028_44	It 's already pretty slow to load . ; Yeah . It 's more segments ? ; Yeah . It 's slow . ; Or ?
Bro004_581	Well , For for the Italian part I mean ; In in what ? ; the uh the um networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits , ; Aurora - two .
Bed013_265	But we can do randomized testing . ; Tah - dah ! ; Which probabilistically will be good enough . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_227	it 's the same sheets , ; yeah ; just with the missing columns filled in . ; yeah .
Bed004_211	or is uh Lila ; I mean , you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way ? ; I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn . ; OK .
Bmr016_1533	Mm - hmm . ; um , " DC ? " ; So they so it 's " PLP ? " ; Ah .
Bns003_266	It is . ; you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU , ; So there are some gaps . ; OK .
Bro019_683	But they d the everything I mean is like , ; but there ; that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_628	where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ? ; Yeah . ; I think so . ; Yeah .
Btr002_788	but ; Yeah , you have to the resolution , ; right ? ; Yeah . Or , like
Bro022_318	I b ; You didn't train it also . ; I ; Right .
Bmr027_1335	Oh , yeah . ; We 're supposed to get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . ; Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , ; uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now ,
Bro008_385	You 're gonna record a bunch on people in cars and so forth , and do these training . ; And then , uh , when y you sell it to somebody , they will be a different person with a different car , and so on . ; So it 's this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it , ; uh , so , you know , the real thing is somewhere in between the two .
Bmr026_375	Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , ; mightn't you ? ; Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , ; Oh , I didn't know he had left already .
Bro004_644	Um Mmm . ; So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , ; these are the results we obtained for Italian uh with straight mmm , PLP features using on - line normalization . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_541	Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this . ; Um , that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , ; that 's another sort of thing " OK , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this " . ; Add extra properties ,
Bed008_925	N ; Yeah . ; Yeah , the time of day . ; Yeah . So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link ,
Bed006_517	Ye ; and ask them more questions ; and sit down together ; and write sensible code
Bro027_1857	But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway . ; And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1430	Interesting . ; Though ; All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , ; Interesting .
Bed017_548	There 's linguists and stuff ; and there 's a lot of it ; and they 're they 're busily working away . ; But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it .
Bmr024_204	and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits . ; Yeah . ; That 'd be great . ; That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later .
Bmr019_1844	Th - it doesn't it won't leave this room . ; Alright , so in the interest of getting to the ; We could do digits while other people eat . ; Yeah .
Btr002_251	You know what I mean ? ; Th - if if it was like , " period , capital SO " , as opposed to , um , " That would be a problem , so . " ; Oh , I see what you 're saying ! ; " That would be a problem . So . "
Bed006_535	It Just a mail that , you know , he 's sending me the the the stuff soon ; This is being sent , ; mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro004_1365	And I mean i it 's possible that the ; I mean , I guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there aren't five or eight . ; There 's there 's there 's gonna be debugging hassles ; and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful .
Bed011_1109	Right . ; Yep . ; " Where is X ? " ; might be another one which is not too complicated .
Bro003_792	I think that is more important , ; Swiss - German . ; Mexican Spain . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1290	Um , ; so this is the first thing . ; Um ; Yeah , another thing that I it 's important to mention is , um , that this has a this has some additional latency .
Btr001_2307	in a way . ; Same with " I don't know " . ; Yeah . ; You can also end an utterance with , uh , " blah - blah - blah
Bro010_1015	or ? ; in addition to detecting sonorants ; or ? ; Um
Bdb001_711	Right . ; And then lower down you would say " here 's a prosodic boundary ; and it has these words in it " . ; And lower down you 'd have " here 's a sentence ,
Bmr014_750	I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient . ; But I don't actually know . ; Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? ; Yes .
Btr002_713	Or just uh s ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I remember I had one . One with that and it was just , al all the time . ; Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely . ; Yeah .
Bro017_558	We we getting we getting there , right . ; Well . ; We are around fifty , fifty - five . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1548	I thought ; you 're saying it doesn't depend on the utterance ; but I thought you were adding an amount that was twenty - five DB down from the signal energy . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_1065	So I ; go onto Amaretto , ; which is fine . ; But then like , um , it takes me a good , like , ten minutes to get re - used to that keyboard .
Bro025_167	You know ? ; Hmm . ; So it so , um , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_310	uh we so we now know I think , what the landscape is like . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we just push on and and uh , do what we need to do . ; And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff .
Bdb001_288	P - file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values , ; right ? ; It 's whatever you want , actually . ; Right .
Bmr007_1320	OK . ; But I I just worked off of my ; OK , go ahead ; It 's really neat .
Bmr009_616	eh , a duration very short uh when we have we have overlapping with speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , definitely . ; Yeah , maybe It may be correlated .
Bmr001_379	Yeah , yeah . ; Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely . ; So , um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1230	Just ; It should be very rare . ; I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have ; Yeah .
Bro021_975	Yeah , the first one . ; Yeah , I guess . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_535	and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below , ; and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below . ; That 's fine . ; Yeah , it 's true .
Bed015_104	The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair ; and , um , ; sort of skipping fonts and whatever . ; The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need .
Bed003_1145	He 's Like this guy has ? ; The JavaBayes guy ? ; Yeah . ; So but , e he doesn't use it .
Btr002_469	Is that what it 's about ? ; I wasn't I couldn't u I don't know , for some reason that didn't make sense to me . ; But th it 's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they 're set on ? ; Right .
Bmr012_457	and I guess Ramana , ; so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from ; it 's it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount ; Right .
Bmr030_635	That 's still pretty dang big . ; Yes . ; Send it via email . ; Yeah .
Btr002_956	Oh that 's annoying ! ; Yep . ; This if I were to ; Yeah .
Bro024_98	Like I think I saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test , or , um , maybe it was something like four seconds , you actually do a little better if you , um , train on six seconds than if you train on four seconds . ; Right . ; Um , ; but the case , uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test , um , comparing train on twelve seconds versus train on six seconds .
Bmr006_1191	Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . ; Yeah . ; But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . ; You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much .
Bmr024_77	uh ; Right . ; That that was basically it . ; Not not much @ @
Bmr009_887	What ? ; What ? ; Well , because If y your your professional use , ; you 're gonna already have the date , and the s
Bed011_347	That that it was it was very stylized , and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing . ; Yeah , Yeah . ; I um I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them . ; Yeah .
Bed011_421	Ten minutes is long . ; I understand , ; but people people you know uh ; It feels like a long time
Bmr011_184	Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio , ; Right . ; and so then that would be , you know , three more . ; Right . OK .
Bmr005_75	Shall I shall I just start ? ; Yeah , just explain what it was . ; OK . ; Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures ,
Bmr008_1380	Yeah . ; So , if you look at on this page that has uh frame energy , ; you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two , ; Yeah .
Btr002_3164	Not necessarily so phonological . ; I agree . And I think there 's another problem too , ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr001_495	And just not bother . ; So it 's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and figuring out where it goes . ; And back up . ; Well , we don't it doesn't need to be backed up .
Bed008_1362	so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . ; No . ; So you can view these as gone . ; OK .
Bmr001_341	So uh so where are we uh now ? ; I mean so we 've just uh We 're doing this recording so we show we can we 're capable of doing recording ; Right . ; uh there 's I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that .
Bed017_154	and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , ; so I tried to see how I can do , um put in the computational nodes in between . ; And what that would look like in a PRM . ; And so I ended up making several classes
Bro014_39	Mmm . ; Um , I did some experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before I had to , uh , go away for the w well , that week . ; Great ! ; Was it last week or whenever ?
Bro023_1459	um , ; at the level of noise I add after . Uh , I know that adding noise helped , um , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing , ; but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one . ; Same thing for the shape of the the noise .
Bmr027_661	Yeah . ; They don't have to go to the web page ; and ; I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now .
Bed005_1352	one ; But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ? ; Cuz , they have instances all the time . ; Yeah , but the ontology is really not a SmartKom thing ,
Bmr020_647	He did a system uh , in ; he he lives in Japan now , ; and he did this backchanneling , automatic backchanneling system . ; Right .
Bmr003_550	And this requires humans just like the the STP stuff . ; Yes , ; yeah . ; Right , right .
Bsr001_833	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And and really see what you can do with a real system . ; So . ; Yeah , for example , when you go to your PDA system it 's , uh , really an awful open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns ,
Bmr031_640	Hmm . ; It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short . ; Sorry . Thanks , Morgan . ; It 's really short , yeah . Yeah .
Bro022_1014	And there are there were some bugs in the program , ; so I was p initially trying to clear them up . ; Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh , the initial frames were silence . ; It always started in the silence state ,
Btr001_2597	and , yeah , you must have too . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And you did also ? ; We we are meant to be transcribing if they 're just left in the the curly brackets ?
Bsr001_884	Right . ; And so that that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments . ; But they were they were parts that were interviews that he worked on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1513	sort of a different crowd , ; and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , ; so that should be interesting . ; What 's the name of the meeting ?
Bed015_594	That is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really . ; That 's OK . ; We usually don't know the point of the sentence at all . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_430	I don't mind By the moment , by the moment . ; Well , but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . ; I I don't ; Yeah , but eh but eh I have to study . What will happen in a general way ,
Bmr015_504	and , it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in in March in getting the proposal out , ; and then , it 's , uh , you know We 'll see what happens . ; Uh , the last one was that you had there , was about naming ? ; Yep .
Bns001_311	I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies . ; So , uh , at the physical level , they 're they 're they are not compatible . ; It 's not a problem . ; No , but s You could have a UMTS gateway that translates everything to that uh w local @ @ .
Btr002_143	um , ; let 's see . ; There 's one other here I thought was interesting . ; Well this was
Bed006_1064	Yeah ? ; Yeah ; because they 're two different things ; one of which is l
Bmr027_448	We can use it we can use a a ploy ; OK . ; like they use to , um ; you know , that when they serve , like
Bmr031_274	Are the same . ; Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words ; Sure . ; and " Yeah ! " and s stuff like that .
Bed016_119	So , um . ; I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it ; I haven't looked at it ; because
Bed006_1425	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2983	Right . ; I was wondering who had been putting those in . ; Yeah . ; Great .
Btr001_1088	It 's rare . ; relatively rare . ; I don't think I ever have . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1272	Bush or Don ? ; Yeah . ; Um , ; you know , f apart from getting preparing the the da the data for the ,
Bro014_1192	It is ; Because we begin , uh , in fifteen point the fifteen point . ; So , ; does does the periodicity of this signal say something about the the
Bro021_134	Yeah . There ; uh , actually , yeah . ; S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero ; and much less to normalize the other coefficients .
Bed006_1732	you know , and leave it up for us to get the parser input um ; Mmm . We know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of RAD . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_644	um ; Uh - oh . ; You have these y y you still have The frequencies are represented ; but the energy distributions are thrown off ,
Btr002_3305	But , um , ; I I f I think , and it may be that it was not from anybody here , ; so . ; But I think that , um , " mumble " is only useful in the s to me , in the sense of " whispered " ,
Bed015_1696	cuz it it it to the extent that it works , it y ; Ties it all into it . ; it it ties together several of of these things . ; Yeah .
Bed015_222	Oh , whatever . ; but I think there 's vestiges of other people 's biases . ; Or wh ; Like
Bed015_1405	Right . ; And therefore you 're supposed to say , " Boy , life sure " ; You know , " in France kids are allowed to drink at age three " . ; And w you 're that 's not just a fact about France .
Bsr001_1433	or even ; phone meetings or something . ; Or meetings like this with about the meetings . ; Uh - huh .
Bro026_641	Anyway . ; OK . ; Great . ; Yeah , I think that 'll be helpful .
Bro010_32	Uh , ; so ; I mean , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , ; Yeah .
Bmr010_985	This also gives me a sense of ; You know , I can I can use that later , with reference to inter - coder reliability kind of issues . ; But the main thing was to get them used to the conventions ; and , you know , the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back
Bmr020_800	Yeah . ; OK . ; Um , so either we should regenerate the original versions , or um , we should just make a note of it . ; Oh .
Bro004_546	No these are the s s s same noises , ; and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect ; yeah . ; At least at least for the first for the well - matched ,
Bmr018_902	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; So so whether the corrections take too much time . ; That 's right .
Bmr001_112	Mm - hmm ! ; Oh , good . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro021_468	Uh , that 's it , I think . ; Mmm . ; Do you have anything , Morgan , ; or ?
Bed015_490	Same thing . ; So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? ; And then I think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y ; whatever
Btr001_2224	Huh . ; Yeah , ; interesting . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1419	So ; Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something . ; OK . ; Yeah , exactly .
Bmr010_353	that they are making progress ; and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription ; and ; I mean , basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world .
Bro027_2026	twenty - third , ; thirtieth , ; sixth . ; That 's right ,
Bns003_890	Um ; I know , in the past it was always if I 'm not writing something nothing gonna happen . ; So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity . ; You have to use your time to finish your work as you uh , have in mind until your end of February ,
Bmr008_97	so Uh did are were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this ? ; No , no . ; Less . ; Less .
Bro018_769	and um cuz the uh ; So King and and Taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_179	Well , what I did is t is to take , um to measure the average ; no , the maximum energy of s each utterance ; and then put a threshold ; Well , this for each mel band .
Bmr013_307	Right . ; Yeah , so you have this feature here , and , overlap , yeah . ; There was no name for that . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1254	Mm - hmm . ; Wow ! ; Is it useful ? ; Yeah ?
Bmr021_328	But since since these files are made to be used with the SRI recognizer , ; uh and the SRI front - end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this transparently um , uh , that will be a quick and quick and easy way to just , uh , get you know , uh , be able to use more ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1213	Mm - hmm . ; but I don't know if it ; I mean , you have to figure out what your targets are . ; Yeah ,
Bmr019_137	And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much . ; It is against my head . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_249	mmm , Because the the uh , @ @ is @ @ . ; Yeah . ; The duration is , uh the variation the variation of the duration is uh , very big on the dat ; Yeah .
Bed006_633	OK . ; But it 's so this time we we are at an advantage ; because it was a problem for the German system to incorporate all these English movie titles . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_429	or just one , two , three , four for four speakers or something . ; Pppt ! ; Could could be helpful . ; I i
Bro003_1716	Because the you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ? ; The That that really throws things off . ; You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector , ; I mean the the , um
Bro013_308	I I guess e the only thing with these the Meeting Recorder and , well , ; So , I think , yeah I think we basically gave up . ; Um . Now , actually for the for the Aur - uh ; But
Bmr027_575	because we basically know everyone on it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_146	and also by the user ID . ; So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . ; Uh The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . ; And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy .
Bro012_230	Hmm . ; Oh ! ; and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , ; alright ?
Bmr026_96	and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's ; Can you mail that out to the list ? ; Mm - hmm , yeah I will . ; I
Bed013_1266	Cuz that that has , you know , basically , you know , s it 's in progress still ; it 's in development still , ; but it definitely has various feature slots , attributes , um , bindings between things ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_827	and then allow people to self - identify if there are other specific things , ; and then in addition , this issue of regions with some sort of time frame for the re region because I think that if you live in Massachusetts now versus you know , in childhood and as adolescence ; So if you lis if if you ; Air conditioning .
Bmr003_2041	and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . ; And and crinkle them and ; And th " that " being a diagram . ; What ?
Bdb001_1162	And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence , ; Yep . ; or approximately . ; Or the time .
Bns001_1269	because there 's a three g third generation like UMTS , a fourth generation more IP related . ; There will be a fifth generation , I 'm sure . ; And then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network , ; if you ever really full I uh uh full I P , end to end .
Bro022_940	Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . ; I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer , ; Mm - hmm . ; then only make a decision because you still need to smooth the decision further .
Bmr012_267	And is it only once that that happens ? ; But ; yeah ; it
Bro012_1176	I thought that you or somebody was talking about ; Well . ; So . ; Uh yeah . B We should let him finish what he w he was gonna say ,
Bed014_1136	OK ? So let 's think of a name for for whatever the this intermediate structure is . ; Oh , we talked about semspec , for " semantic spec specification " ; Mmm . ; and that seems
Bmr028_636	Right ? ; No . ; So so , I guess Don would need your help to to create a new set of split , uh , meetings . ; Sure .
Bmr029_494	So , you could certainly do better than that by doing , for instance uh , cluster the segments , ; which is what we do , say , in a Broadcast News system , where you don't have speaker labels . ; But that would be another processing step that I 'm I would have to debug first , and so forth , ; and so we wanna avoid that .
Bed014_781	Mm - hmm . ; cuz this is clearly part of th ; Yeah , we 've we 've done quite a bit of that . ; Huh ?
Bmr018_674	A normal . ; Yeah . ; but then there were the others were sort of decaying from there . ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_462	Comma also or not ? ; No commas . ; No . ; And then we looked at locations where ,
Bmr008_964	I 'd have to I I 'd wanna relate it back to training . ; Good , ; Bad . ; " How many years did you study English " ,
Bns001_892	Maybe video games . ; If you are traveling ; uh , it 's boring to travel ; and then you decide to play a g video game with somebody else who 's traveling .
Bmr028_1007	those types of tasks , where you don't have the speaker segmentation given to you . ; S does the clustering ? Do you give it sort of a target number of clusters ? Or is it ? adapted in some way ? ; Um , you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use as a threshold . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_415	XG ? ; That 's also where we store the The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , ; Oops . ; No .
Bro027_1761	Uh . ; Right . ; So , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? ; Well , uh ,
Bed012_391	What ? ; I don't see your point . ; What what what I am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . ; And now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that ,
Bed016_1126	Alright . Yeah . ; But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see , ; um , ; Right .
Bmr005_709	On - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone , but ; Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ? ; Oh , ; yeah .
Bro022_881	Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . ; Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , ; but it plus energy is sort of ; Yeah .
Buw001_1169	At least . Yeah . ; you think ? ; m i Even if that much ? ; Uh , less .
Bmr003_1176	I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate . ; I think . ; But I 'm not sure . ; I 'd I 'd say
Bed002_266	If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . ; Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . ; So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . ; So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there .
Bro008_181	When is the development set I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ? ; Like the day before you leave or something ? ; Uh , probably the day after they leave , ; but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave .
Bmr018_802	From the insertions , maybe ? ; fr fr from the ; um , yeah , there 's a way to tell . ; It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,
Bro019_1423	Um , ; were were you gonna say something ? ; Mmm . ; Oh .
Bns001_1218	access and then mobility management ; and That is it . ; I want to focus on it . ; Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this .
Bsr001_869	but probably not that segmentation part . ; But I don't know if they are using a different data for that . ; But I mean , it 's s While I say " Switchboard " , s eh , of course there 's only two speakers . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1186	I g you You 're the expert on the D T ; Well , the D T Ds mean we can do whatever however we want it . ; but ; Yeah .
Bed006_1792	I 'm mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting . ; So you showed some in this here before ; Mm - hmm . ; and maybe you 've posted it before
Bro012_1526	Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis . ; Um . But . ; Hmm . ; So to do that right you 'd probably want to have allow for them all
Bmr003_1976	Mostly in house . ; That 's right . ; OK . ; Well , yeah ,
Bro008_124	you 've - you haven't seen any final results for that ; yeah . ; And they used the main thing that that they used was spectral subtraction ? ; Or
Btr002_769	Especially we have really good headphones , ; when I realized ; like ; yeah , when I realized , I I meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal
Bro027_1297	Yeah . ; So it 's mostly Well , " Car " is stationary , ; Mm - hmm . ; " Babble " , it 's a stationary background plus some voices ,
Bro024_1016	The French Telecom . ; Well , France Telecom was was was very short latency ; It 's ; and they had a very good result .
Bro016_931	and then just add some kind of on - line normalization in in the neural network . ; Mmm . ; OK . ; Well , this 'll be , I think , something for discussion with Hynek next week .
Bro028_734	And then we just use that to determine some scaling factor that we use . ; Yeah . So I mean , I I think that that 's a reasonable thing to do ; and the only question is what 's the actual knob that we use ? ; And the knob that we use should
Bmr028_1528	Huh ! ; And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , " Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . " ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_850	Um , so the the only question is how much of it ; The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro019_1321	Um . ; Mmm . ; There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the uh extracting some higher - order uh , information from the cepstral coefficients ; and I forgot the name .
Bmr031_63	Yeah . ; u ; Didn't get the door . ; Oh , you just get the door now .
Bed009_752	ah and so things must be simpler ; I see , ; so ; but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers .
Bro004_1067	then now that it I understand it . It 's ; " yeah , ; where does the LDA come from ? " ; In the In earlier experiments , they had taken LDA from a completely different database ,
Bed010_904	It 's So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , right . ; Right .
Bmr019_981	OK . ; not for long utterances , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1171	uh uh , ; we have all the data transcribed ; and we have these transcribers ; and we were we 're the
Bro014_1084	Well , some voiced sound can have also , like , a noisy part on high frequencies , ; and ; Yeah . ; But
Bro017_1230	Mm - hmm . ; Which which uh uh one is using that set of hurdles , another one set is using another set of hurdles . ; So . And And then it 's difficult to c compare . ; What about Harry ?
Bed005_1211	That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR . ; So we 'll have to think of of a way t t ; Yeah . ; it 's a Noisy - arg - max or a Noisy - whatever .
Bed003_1813	I mean , that 's how we get a corpus that we can label . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; Whereas , you know , if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted ,
Bmr020_1065	OK . ; Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as . ; You know , Wally Chafe says that um , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , uh , that the the what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds . ; Mmm .
Bed017_228	the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one , ; but , um , we 'll see . ; So w Anyway . So that 's a a major open issue . ; If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run
Bmr009_1166	Ye ; I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do . ; It doesn't even ; Yeah , exactly .
Bmr003_1563	so you couldn't get any clues from volume that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . ; Stereo . ; Yeah . ; You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case .
Bmr010_1003	so what what should I do with that ? " ; Yeah . ; And I said , " well for our purposes , ; Yeah .
Bed015_1946	There 's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where where it goes where some guy goes , " every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . " ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Exactly .
Bmr014_217	Oh . ; They got sa apparent ; Well , Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? ; I have no clue .
Bed015_621	OK . ; OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like " profile , designate , focus " , et cetera , et cetera . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , right , right , right .
Bmr013_90	But that 's really your choice , it 's your ; So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? ; Or do they have to happen at the same time before ; No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time .
Bsr001_2380	I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No , but that that is beautiful
Bed005_382	Yeah . Let 's do that . ; Oh . ; Mmm . ; M - three - L dot DTD ?
Bro027_1328	mm - hmm . ; And and the thing I I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . ; Maybe that they 're a lot worse . ; You know ?
Bro019_765	I I you know , ; so I ; I I you know , ; I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars ,
Bro010_43	and , uh , we designed new filters , ; using uh recursive filters actually . ; So when you say " we " , is that something Sunil is doing ; or is that ?
Bed006_985	like forced motion and caused action and stuff ; like you have for SPG ? ; Yeah . ; And if so like can are you able to enforce that you know if if it 's if it 's SPG action then you have that schema ,
Bmr003_1377	Well , and they 've thought about things . ; You know , I mean , they they do have ; So you have when you when you play it back , um , it 's it is useful to have , uh , a a break mark to se segment it . ; But it wouldn't be strictly necessary
Bmr012_1080	it 's just the the ; Right , ; it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear . ; Right .
Bmr027_142	Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly , ; And the reason I liked it was because ; as opposed to , uh ; was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .
Bmr022_1154	Send email to Jane that someone has done a revision . ; Right . ; I I wanna also say that , you know , this is a ; uh , uh , My my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm .
Bro016_70	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so the next question to ask , which is I think the one that that that Andreas was dre addressing himself to in the lunch meeting , is , um , we 're not supposed to adjust the back - end , ; but anybody using the system would . ; Yeah .
Bro027_133	I guess , ; in terms of the noise . ; The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1581	This was my build - up . ; An i an idea that would be nice i ; Yeah . ; OK , we 're crossing our fingers .
Bro010_147	and then there 's a third thing , ; is that , um , basically the way on - line normalization was done uh , is just using this recursion on on the um , um , on the feature stream , ; Yeah . ; and but this is a filter ,
Bns003_120	I believe David is , uh , currently working on that . to set up the fire wall , ; and he 's not an expert for that ; and when I get the signal I will ask one more time . ; Nah , but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he @ @ .
Bro023_607	Can I ask just a a high level question ? ; Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? ; Hmm . ; What 's what 's the deal with that ?
Buw001_1832	So I have the ; We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . ; And so it depends , ; w e e e
Bmr020_130	So , I thought it was highly relevant ; That 's ; Yeah I 'm ; Yeah .
Bro019_1054	Mm - hmm . ; and and ; It had additive n ; But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction .
Bed002_179	So , the most important form is the consent form , ; so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . ; I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , ; so you will have to leave what you set .
Bro004_1329	Yes . ; Hmm . Mm - hmm . ; That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN ; Tonic .
Bns002_591	So that was my question . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr011_186	and so then that would be , you know , three more . ; Right . OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do ,
Bed017_485	Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , ; but he wants to point to the places w w ; Yeah , so . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert ; Documents that have the answers .
Bed011_803	or , you know , ; whatever ? ; OK . So ; S so I think there are a variety of things in which um
Bmr027_184	Yeah , exactly . Yeah . ; I didn't mean to isolate them . ; Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish . ; Yeah . Sorry .
Bmr013_214	Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , ; and that people might articulate more , ; and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_366	" here 's an idea " , right ? ; That 's what that paper was , ; " here 's here 's one possible thing you could do " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1233	What about Harry ? ; Uh . We received a mail last week and you are starting to to do some experiments . ; He got the he got the software . ; Yeah . They sent the release .
Bro023_422	I 'm talking about Italian , ; Italian ? ; yeah . ; And what did
Bro027_1553	So you were just trying ; I think you r ; I mean , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect ; but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ?
Btr001_2652	Uh - huh . ; Up there at the top . ; Ah . Oh . ; OK .
Btr002_502	Wow . ; Yeah . ; We 're we 're really spoiled , then , with our interface here , ; Mmm .
Bro010_813	where um Where we 've been @ @ uh taking um sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , ; and then combining them some somehow down the line , ; um , ; they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , um , training up a detector that detects for , um , these phonetic features
Bro024_541	and it says " fifty percent " ; looking in the lower right - hand corner , ; " fifty percent relative performance " . ; For the clean training .
Bro012_1082	and with the Alcatel VAD . ; And the experiment was sometime better , sometime worse . ; Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features . ; Yes .
Bmr010_997	Oh , no . ; Is that good or bad ? ; Well , they they 're very perce ; they 'll So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " ,
Bro027_595	Ah . ; So in that case there isn't too much in parallel . ; Uh ; No .
Bro028_507	They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , uh , data . ; Um , so I haven't run the scripts yet . ; Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it ; and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it .
Btr002_1664	Is that true ? ; The ones with Liz , and you . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed011_709	Yeah . ; OK . ; but I think other things you can , if I remember right . ; So is like " biking there " part of like " driving there " ,
Bed006_984	So . ; like forced motion and caused action and stuff ; like you have for SPG ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2228	I mean , it 's difficult because you want it to be real speech , right ? ; And also it 's not clear how well people can even adjust to even adjust to that kind of rule . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_697	but only mark speaker ; Uh - huh . ; Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ? ; OK .
Bed006_696	So this is something that , you know , may also be a res As a result of your work ; in the future , we may find out that , you know , there 're really s these subtle differences between ; um ; even within the domain of entering in the light of a Source - Path - Goal schema , that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there .
Bsr001_605	yeah . ; In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on , ; " voice environments for programmers " , ; but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better .
Bns001_1571	And when you when you will go back to Spain , right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Sure . ; Yeah , so . and and that 's why , in principle , the skills will be always available I guess .
Bed003_278	No . ; Right . ; Got it . ; But uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter ,
Bmr009_149	Yeah . ; OK . ; So yeah there there there There 's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is there there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some sort ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr006_604	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . ; One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE .
Btr002_2534	I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen " hmph " in literature meaning in ; Right . ; but it 's a s a sigh a si uh , sorry . A sound of indignation . ; Right .
Bmr031_1378	So So , uh um . ; Yeah . ; Neat . ; So we 're working on that .
Bmr031_1566	But do you do this , say , just in the vowel regions , ; And then ; and do you ? ; a There 's there 's a whole bunch of , um , sort of unknowns .
Btr001_815	Have you had that happen ? ; Mmm , yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_839	So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh . ; But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .
Bed015_785	For instance , you Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements ; and that 's probably relevant for the like " where is " , you know , " the castle " kind of thing ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Because you might want to say that , um , location or cert certain WH words bring you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , " I don't know the identity of this thing " kind of way on certain elements .
Bns001_1379	Let let me put an example . ; You know I Some days ago , I bought , like some of you , this kind of things . ; This is a PDA ; eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible ,
Bro028_920	Well , he 's got it anyway , ; so he can . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_929	Supervised clustering . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is the the eh , first idea ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_403	What do they connect to ? ; Uh , keyboard . ; and they generate keystrokes . ; Oh , that 's totally cool .
Btr002_919	and how certain the boundary is . ; If I can see it if it 's if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear , ; Oh yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah .
Bed016_769	Yeah . ; right , ; and like , what is film , ; the state you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource .
Bro003_1894	so , well . ; But ; So that does make an interesting question , though . ; Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this .
Bed011_314	And . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; That was the first subject .
Bmr029_410	I could re - check that . ; But it was such a bad baseline that I don't know what that means . ; Mmm . Right . ; Right .
Bro011_323	I see . ; But that 's uh uh all that 's is a a certainly relevant uh study ; and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . ; We have this problem with the overloading of the term " feature "
Bed005_1061	right ? ; So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . ; It 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , ; you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state .
Bed010_1056	Uh , " these are the decisions " ; I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . ; It 's a design problem . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1063	Then we compute the difference . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; uh , sum the differences ?
Bro021_1227	because it 's conditional . ; And this I need to to calcu ; I know this ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_1651	Yeah . ; So I 'm going " OK . " ; " I 'm just gonna listen to you . " ; Yeah .
Bro005_1160	and then uh in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , ; and noise type ; uh , and uh , uh , channel characteristic , ; sort of all over the map .
Bro003_41	OK , always count on a serious comment from that corner . ; So , um , ; uh , and uh , then uh , talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that 's starting to get worked out . ; And then , anything else anybody has that isn't in that list ?
Bro017_205	if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious . ; So well , you know , just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant , C , to every every value . ; Well you 're you 're basically y ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1278	more . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1113	And it would just end up on a separate ribbon . ; So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that . ; Right . ; You look puzzled .
Bns003_462	That 's the whole problem , that nobody wants to do it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK .
Bed017_713	so digital divide and stuff like that . ; So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . ; But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , ; something that is of great social value .
Bmr026_615	Let 's see . ; The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that um uh , I talked briefly to Mari ; and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here ; but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next .
Bro004_684	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . ; Actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . ; And using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database .
Bro027_188	so I think when when he gets done with his prelim study I think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . ; And then ; When are his prelims ? ; Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks .
Bmr024_677	Right ? ; It has ; I mean , that was my intention . ; And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't ,
Bro021_1161	And what are you using for the noisy ? ; Y y doing that strictly ; Of the noise ; I estimate the noises wi
Bro027_1340	I mean , you haven't done all the experiments ; but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? ; But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower , ; Y yeah , oh .
Bmr002_1435	Are these more expensive or less expensive than this kind ? ; They 're much more expensive . ; OK . ; I I Which I don't understand
Bmr016_132	How about " O " versus " zero " ? ; I mean , the other thing is we could just bag it ; because it 's it 's ; it 's - I 'm not worrying about it
Bmr031_133	I don't know . ; What pie chart ? ; Pie ? ; Oh .
Bmr011_1382	Um , and it is a little bit of a trek for campus folks . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; You might give them a free lunch .
Bmr024_982	What 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the C Ds every year . ; H everytime it was a " gonna " " gonna die " . ; Well , I mean , the C Ds are are an op ; Well
Btr002_1121	the one on the left is that Basmati ? ; By the light switch , yeah . ; Yep . ; I believe that 's correct , yeah .
Bns003_56	or maybe too with Free BSD , ; Well the first ; I doubt I don't know ; stop ,
Btr002_2873	they were just very small , ; but they were there . ; I think they 're there pretty much a all the time . ; I agree .
Btr001_2248	Ending with " so " . ; I mean , s I just wanna be sure . ; Or I maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa ; When you end with " so " .
Btr002_3206	ER . ; But if they 're saying " or " in a reduced way so it comes out as " er " , do it as " or " . ; R ; Right .
Bro008_206	I mean , just exactly this sort of thing of , you know , why why these features seem to be behaving differently , uh , in California than in Oregon . ; Hmm . ; Might have something to do with electricity shortage . ; Uh , we didn't we didn't have enough electrons here
Bro018_895	Ha ! ; Oh ! ; You had the sa same answer anyway . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_636	and ; and there is all this work on transcription , ; similar probably to what we do in Switchboard but with better bandwidth , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_190	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ? ; Probably something that we specified in M - three - L ,
Bmr007_1158	OK , maybe maybe send me a sentence that 's a little thought through about that . ; So , OK , I 'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say " a bunch of " ? ; " Bunch of stuff " , yeah , " stuff " is probably bad too , ; Yep .
Bmr026_1021	Right . ; Yeah . ; So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh ; Yeah .
Bro003_1751	because it 's not ; Uh , yeah , ; so that that 's the question . ; And we don't have to solve it right this s second ,
Bro005_688	s What 's this ? ; We only have two hundred eighty six different tests ; And no not two thousand . ; Ugh ! I was impressed
Bmr022_1155	Right . ; I I wanna also say that , you know , this is a ; uh , uh , My my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm . ; But it it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file .
Bmr010_397	That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient . ; Yeah , exactly . ; And just keep those things separate . ; And and , um , Dan Ellis 's hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things ,
Bmr030_290	Right , well , then it 's not a linear f fit . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; You 're not fitting anything then .
Bmr008_625	Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of ; and their parents ; Well , we have this We hafta ; So . He hasn't given you the overview ,
Bmr006_389	Uh ; I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea . ; Yeah , I thought so too . ; Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that
Bro022_126	after after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . ; Right ? ; Um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_681	But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still ; Right . ; Right . ; you know ?
Bed011_604	Probably you sh ; Not that I know of actually . ; Yeah , when hell Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over . ; Yeah .
Bro026_561	Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ? ; Sorry . ; No . ; Not yet .
Bmr006_1272	What looked different ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . ; Cross - co cross - correlation .
Bed008_1427	OK . ; OK . ; I mean It it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if if uh X - one says no , ; you know , a low value coming out of X - on
Bed006_910	Right . ; I don't know if this answers your question , ; I was just staring at this while you were talking , ; sorry .
Bmr001_592	Oh , God knows . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Cuz you you can't have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million parts , ; Right .
Bmr011_1203	And the third one is is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have ; which is that , um , if , uh if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . ; For instance , uh , marking in some overlapping ; potentially overlapping fashion , uh , the value of , uh , ar articulatory features .
Btr002_2557	Or ; Hhh . ; I i I don't know . ; I yeah . I guess it could have two meanings , sort of .
Bmr027_163	OK . I spoke loosely . ; The the German , French Sorry , the German , Dutch , and Spanish ones . ; Spanish . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1187	Yeah , so I don't know . ; We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul , ; have a good voice detector , ; have a good ,
Bro005_342	No . ; And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . ; Uh no , not quite that , ; is it .
Bmr013_244	Mm - hmm . ; Some things are really difficult . ; You know , ; just listening .
Bmr019_1083	And I was telling Don , do not take this as an example of how people should work . ; Do as I say , ; That 's r ; So , we will try .
Bed013_224	Bhaskara said , we had calculated out and Bhaskara believes that it 's larger than the number of particles in the universe . ; And if i ; I don't know if that 's right or not . ; Th - that 's big .
Bmr014_1039	Yeah . ; Yeah , uh no that it tha ; Tha - that 's true . ; That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around .
Bed009_41	Hi . ; Hi . ; OK . ; So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs .
Bmr019_1018	because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody . ; Exactly . ; Exactly my point . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1021	We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than , uh we 're gonna test on , ; but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ? ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's that that seems like the the the real question .
Btr001_924	Mm - hmm , ; I it it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly . ; There was an adjustment , ; and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that
Bsr001_1891	You don't wanna train on just a few people 's voices ; cuz then you 'll just learn the their prosodic patterns . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Btr002_2084	Yeah . ; Oh really ? ; but it was just bizarre . ; I still do that . I still do that .
Buw001_1446	OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh , you might want to mention something that that you brought up . ; " Thing that was discussed . "
Bed005_1399	and then would hash or whatever we do to say , " ah ! ; If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . " ; So , I I think we can handle that . ; And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal .
Bmr003_2034	There 's a lip in these tables . ; Nice . ; And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded . ; Clink !
Bro016_405	Just summary of the experiment and the conclusion ; and ; something like that . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1021	Th ; Yeah . ; Oh , oh ! ; So you wanna backspace and you get apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe .
Bro018_343	This ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; Then maybe I can understand .
Bro023_1003	Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , uh , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . ; You can uh compute , ; y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter , ; um , and the gain of this filter is the , um , signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy .
Bmr005_313	Yeah . ; It 's an inference . ; Yeah , you could do all these inferences , ; Yeah .
Btr002_1945	And this is without the channelized interface . ; So you you have no idea . ; Oh my gosh . ; Oh man .
Bed005_260	Y i ; Yep . ; OK . ; And that 's that 's the next step ,
Btr001_560	Oh , excellent . ; absolutely . ; Um ; Oh , good to know .
Bmr009_559	Right . ; but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in ; so I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that . ; That would be great .
Bed004_639	We might . ; Uh , I mean that that 's certainly one thing we can do . ; Uh , it 's true that the way you have this , a lot of the times you have ; what you 're having is the values rather than the variable .
Bmr010_932	And , um , ; it didn't work as well . So . ; Huh . ; OK .
Buw001_251	But , uh , no one spontaneously provided anything . ; I ; I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , ; Right .
Bed016_595	but there are basic cases . ; That is , um , there are physical containers , ; there are physical paths , ; there
Bro028_274	Um . ; Yeah . The last thing is that I think we are getting close to human performance . ; Well , that 's something I would like to investigate further , ; but ,
Bmr010_78	Yeah . ; OK . ; Um , and , um , the other thing , uh , ; which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit ,
Bro003_1939	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; this is another p ; yeah ,
Bed004_505	Mm - hmm . ; Good . ; Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place ; and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " .
Bmr008_1089	Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact . ; And this would and and we discussed this , ; this is with reference to like the DTD , ; what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific .
Bro012_39	We just run over the data before we deal with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; um The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here , uh whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not . ; And I don't know if anybody knows .
Bro022_944	Right . ; Right . ; So that 's always there . ; Yeah .
Bed012_426	it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gonna be a node for Go - there or not , and there 's gonna be a node for Enter , View , Approach . ; Wel ; W OK . ; So , someone asked a question .
Bro023_204	And , um ; OK . ; Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time . ; I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway .
Bmr006_1016	So , some sort of ; That 's ; Mm - hmm . ; I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective
Bed013_1397	All others are useless . ; Yeah . ; That 's good . ; Nice overture ,
Bmr022_447	" One hundred twenty - four " ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , th although
Bmr019_832	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I didn't do it word level , ; but but in terms ; So I so for for one of the N S A groups .
Bmr028_7	Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the ; I mean , I sent you a couple things , ; although I don't remember them . ; You only sent me one thing , which was demo status .
Bro027_734	but with the neural network . ; Wow . ; So this is almost ten percent . ; With the f with the neural net .
Bro013_657	and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't um don't over - alert the problem ; there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on uh the sub - problems at hand ; so you can imagine um five or so parallel um features um transitioning independently ; and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data .
Bmr016_55	and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form , ; and they 're slowly s trickling in . ; So the relevance of the speaker form here , s ; It 's for labeling the extracted audio files .
Bmr011_1811	Is that right ? ; Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , ; Mm - hmm . ; because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will
Bmr013_393	an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . ; Yeah . ; Well ; Right .
Bmr012_1002	is it the ; Eight . ; It just it 's eight channels come in , ; It 's eight .
Bro026_973	We go all the way down to phonemes . ; Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um , metric of of goodness , uh , i if our
Bmr018_1561	You get everything right . ; Yeah . ; It 's just no ; But
Bed011_685	Um , " mode " , ; uh , I have found three , ; " drive there " , " walk there " uh or " be driven " , which means bus , taxi , BART . ; OK .
Bed017_561	The absolutely no no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here . ; Right . ; And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine , ; Right .
Bmr005_329	But eh , tsk , ehhh In that way I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session ; to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone . ; And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session ; and I I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events ,
Bed015_374	Right . ; And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . ; But you know , for now , I mean , ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1204	So that that I have three things . ; Un - yeah un - segmented , the automatic , and the the ideal one . ; Yeah . ; But the recognizer 's putting up some resistance
Bmr018_524	I disagree . ; There 's a reason I disagree , and that is that , uh , you it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio . ; There 're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal , ; bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel .
Bro014_175	Right . ; So at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state , ; Uh - huh . ; or ?
Bed010_649	OK . ; OK . ; And um , so , ; this video tape is in front of me .
Bmr028_343	OK . ; I 'm flying out there the Sunday before . ; So . Um ; Hmm .
Bmr010_998	Is that good or bad ? ; Well , they they 're very perce ; they 'll So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " , ; not really " and " ,
Bed016_957	that 's like ; Two hundred million dollars . ; Right . ; It 's not for sale .
Bed016_106	We are ? ; We might . ; OK . ; Well , you you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do .
Bmr006_1398	Yeah . ; Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Hundred .
Bro010_280	It th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay . ; Yeah , ; so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2085	I 'm not sure . ; Um , ; if people were interested they could talk to them , ; but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved .
Btr001_991	I mean , maybe " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK " ; and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , ; so it 's it 's definitely there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether " kay " is is enough of a variant ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1041	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 've run into that . ; Really ?
Bmr007_277	Uh , so le let 's think about the case where A starts speaking and then B overlaps with A , and then the minute boundary happens . ; And let 's say that after that minute boundary , um B is still speaking , and A overlaps with B , ; that would be a new overlap . ; But otherwise um , let 's say B comes to the conclusion of of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her ,
Bmr013_584	Yeah , and and I had I had , uh , specific problems with . ; I get it . ; So new use ninetieth quartile , rather than , minimum . ; Yeah .
Bro027_545	So five frames , that 's twenty . ; but . ; OK , ; so it 's who un two hundred and ten .
Bmr007_960	Mm - hmm . ; Sorry . ; And and then you you , eh you try to to apply that , eh , eh , eh , speech recognizer to that signal , to the PDA , eh speech file , I I think you will have problems , because the the the the condition you you will need t t I I suppose that you will need to to to retrain it . ; Oh , absolutely .
Bmr025_535	Right . ; you actually have to say which one . ; I know ; Yeah , I usually delete the
Bmr011_496	uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . ; Xerox . ; And so there 's a wall of mikes . ; And you get really , really good beam - forming with that sort of thing .
Bed002_742	But , is it ; I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting th the data ; of , like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city . as like one situation . ; And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that .
Bsr001_202	No . ; those ; I 'm gonna pass out . ; Wait ,
Bro005_1196	So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? ; I mean they they were not not using the neural net . ; Uh I don't know . ; OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single
Bmr016_181	Mm - hmm . ; like , you know , " six sixty - one would be read as six one " . ; Right . ; And I think people will get it .
Bro018_1148	It was it was getting one percent or something on the near field . ; Wasn't it ? ; Mm - hmm , ; or it wa a it was around one .
Bro010_863	so they 're little neural neural units . ; Um , ; and , um , ; they have to have targets .
Bro025_257	because , um , with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent ; and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent . ; On top of the VAD that they provide ? ; No .
Bro023_387	ten point seven , ; And forty forty . ; and ; Forty percent is the high mismatch .
Buw001_720	But having ; Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . ; Mm - hmm . ; And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening ,
Bed011_8	Alright . ; Yeah , let 's get started . ; Um Hopefully Nancy will come , ; if not , she won't .
Bmr012_969	um and this came up talking to to Jerry also ; that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow ; Yeah . ; so I don't know if anyone has ideas
Bmr029_39	It 's more like a day , probably . ; Um , how much worse is the short training set than the large one , in terms of the ultimate performance ? ; Mmm , it 's like Something like three three percent ; three or four percent absolute .
Bro026_363	but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . ; But what what ; So how did they fill up this all these these bits ? ; I mean , if we 're u
Bmr024_1474	So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models . ; I don't think that ; Hmm . ; We have never seen big differences .
Bmr025_779	So . ; I know we haven't been using it ; but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods ; Right .
Bro023_655	OK . ; So ; but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have . ; So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions
Bns003_454	your argument is , uh , I think it we have to have the right to change it . ; Yeah . ; So if there 's anything changing in insurances or something something like that , that we have access to this page further on to chan to make any changes . ; Yeah .
Bed012_602	They should come when they 're done their stuff , basically , whenever that is . ; So . ; What d what do they need to do left ? ; Um ,
Bed009_809	and then somebody else in Tuebingen picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen , ; yeah . ; Definitely . ; But is that the kind of thing y
Bmr019_303	The key ; So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names . ; Right . I saw that . ; And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script .
Bmr008_1023	Oh , there 's another form . ; Shall we wait for other forms later , or you Keep going more form ; No , you got what 's the other form ? ; Uh , the other form is a modified digits form .
Bed003_1365	And this um m won't differentiate between all modes , ; yeah ? ; but at least it 'll tell us " OK here we have something that ; somebody that wants to go someplace ,
Bed002_1093	which might be useful too . ; Right . ; So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with . ; And it 's available Matlab code .
Bed015_1009	or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . ; OK , so well that 's ; should we flip over to the other side officially then ? ; Mm - hmm , hmm .
Bed009_431	people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if it 's only like in in the in the film and T V thing , ; OK , you can do this .
Bmr011_449	Is is he the one working on that ? ; Well that 's what they 're starting up . ; OK . ; Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They they haven't done it yet .
Bmr010_324	But you s ; What our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro025_611	So we have a VAD which is like neur that 's a neural net . ; Oh , yeah . Hmm . ; Oh , you 're talking about the VAD net . ; Yeah .
Bro012_225	From point ; Well , we tried we tried point one , ; I I 'm sorry ; f for point from You change at point one
Bmr010_1399	for each ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed014_714	I mean ; What uh , what 's the argument for putting it in the construction ? ; Is it just that the s synonym selection is better , or ? ; Oh , wel Well , the ar the The argument is that you 're gonna have the
Bmr011_231	Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w ; Yeah . ; It 's also like n no breathing , ; Yeah .
Bed012_11	There were , like , the you know , @ @ and all that stuff . ; But . I thought you you said you were adding stuff ; but I don't know . ; Uh , no .
Bed002_959	n No one is , at the moment . ; Right . ; OK . ; So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .
Bmr024_1414	And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters . ; You can actually continuously vary it between the two . ; And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones . ; And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference .
Bmr028_672	Wel ; So we 're OK for for a couple weeks , then . ; Markham probably needs u H he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down . ; To you .
Btr001_899	But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation . ; Mm - hmm . ; So just do a you know , a mark , then " fascinating " , and then put " PRN " and uh " interrupted by a pause " or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bmr024_1517	Yeah . ; but I uh , I don't wanna go into , ; Mm - hmm . ; but but I I I th I think it could be the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way , uh , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth ,
Bns002_222	Uh , you know , the easiest eh way to to show how this works is or at least one of I think one of the easiest is that this drawing , or this picture , ; what what we have is a set of nodes , each one at a different location . ; At at at a at an at a given moment this eh node , this dash node is is transmitting ; and uh , the arrows are representing this transmission
Bed006_1157	Exactly . ; We o o ; It 's I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know train station London before , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_363	But if if , uh if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Oh .
Bro003_267	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So . ; So that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?
Bns002_317	and also because that way Miguel , for example , it may be is not being able to hearing me will hear your CTS and will know that you are about to receive uh data from me . ; OK ? ; So ; in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh , used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept a reception is taking place .
Bro021_369	I mean ; Which which one is closer to what the proposal was that was submitted to Aurora ? ; Are they ; they both ?
Bmr025_306	We we can look into it , ; but ; Yeah . ; The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to
Bmr002_968	It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . " ; Cool . ; Boy , the recognition on what you just mumbled is going to be really horrible . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1094	Well , I mean , you just have no idea . ; I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , ; Mm - hmm . ; and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time .
Bro014_1363	Oh , it 's that time - frequency trade - off thing . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; I see .
Bro025_355	Right . ; OK . ; So that 's that 's really not not bad . ; So we may in fact we 'll see what they decide . We may in fact have , um , the the , uh , latency time available for to have a neural net .
Bmr024_1376	I mean ; Uh ; I mean , if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area ; We prune very conservatively .
Bro014_413	Well , that 's an argument for it , ; but let me give you the opposite argument . ; Uh - huh . ; The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things .
Bed008_138	Alright . ; And um I didn't come uh ; maybe a user ; I don't know ,
Bro022_1161	I don't know . ; It 's k it 's k ; It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . ; Well , it 's not too much ,
Bed006_398	OK , that 's what I mean ; so like those tasks are all gonna be um unambiguous about which of the three modes . ; Hopefully . ; Right . OK .
Bro021_967	I I can do this incorrectly . ; Well , the expression that appear in the in the paper , is , uh ; The log ; the Taylor series expansion for log one plus N by X is
Btr002_1525	I haven't paid attention to the numbers . ; I sort of like visually , i ; it helps me to have it be separated enough that I could find a new breaking point if I needed it . ; Yeah .
Bro024_310	r and it ; right ? ; right . ; OK ,
Bed015_1712	Yeah . ; Mmm , isn't I mean , I 'm I was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space ; and then builds up ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_507	" Oh , ; this guy did something there , ; maybe I can contact him and ask him would you like to do something , contribute , whatever . " ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bro012_694	that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo ; because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices . ; But not of reverberation . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2371	And after a while , I started getting confused as to whether or not he was , like , just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself , ; or whether he was meaning it in conversat ; Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_186	Basically . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Um .
Bed003_1782	So we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we actually did not want to constrain it too much , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_172	Oh , we should do it . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them .
Bmr009_351	I don't think this is true , but what if ; To study individual ? ; Hmm ? ; Sorry ,
Bmr008_621	Yeah . ; Or someone could in Geor - in in New York and have , I mean , any number of different types of speech patterns . ; Or their parents live ; yeah .
Bmr023_1077	I 'm actually f quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up , ; What if ? ; that that I think that 's this that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the P L P fe features . ; And that 's obviously working great .
Bmr024_186	" Seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two " . ; Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? ; Yes . ; Because , uh , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it .
Bns001_1630	They they want something pretty strange from me that I think of a service , ; a network service . ; There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day ; and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start - ups or whatever .
Bmr010_41	Yeah . ; Yes . ; I would prefer this . ; Yeah , well .
Bmr027_1307	Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate ; So . ; and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out . ; OK .
Bmr001_209	I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box . ; But um but he hasn't had time . ; Yeah . ; Well , I think I think he is quite interested in doing it .
Bmr023_1197	and and and it helped a lot . ; Uh - huh . And i does it help ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Btr002_2038	Yeah . ; Yeah . But I I think that still overall you 're gonna have probably three or four or five dominant speakers . ; One thing I noticed is that , like , ; uhhh ! There was this one meeting I was transcribing , there were nine nine speakers ,
Bro027_511	and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay . ; So , um ; Plus there is a delta at the input . ; Yeah ,
Bns001_891	I don't know . ; Maybe video games . ; If you are traveling ; uh , it 's boring to travel
Bed011_510	Yeah , this is where ; yeah ; th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah . ; OK .
Bed010_382	I don't think it 's ; Is it free ? ; Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I it seems to ; Uh , it may be free to academics .
Bmr020_1236	They just do that on the main channels . ; Yeah . ; So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts . ; OK .
Bro019_1120	Anything else going on ? ; at you guys ' end , ; or ? ; I don't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters ,
Bed015_192	Yeah . ; Yeah , but it 's not an " if - then " . ; I know . ; Anyway , so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word ,
Bro011_425	So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . ; Hmm . ; And so ; I don't know how complicated it is to go from there
Bed008_505	what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions ; Mm - hmm . ; and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff . ; OK .
Bmr029_784	So , do you have that processed there , then ; right ? ; Because you already did did y didn't you already do that experiment ? ; I I I got confused ,
Bed016_151	Um , actually this is the the newest version after your comments , ; and ; Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1260	Yeah last week last week I was sort of r arguing for having it wide open , ; but then everybody said " Oh , no , ; but then it will be hard to interpret ; because some people will say Cincinnati and some will say Ohio " .
Bro027_60	Yeah . ; For some reason , uh , Dave thought it was twenty , ; So the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred ; but .
Bmr025_481	Right . ; I have not . ; Well bu ; Oh , OK .
Bed015_1952	So , is is that does that make sense as a , uh a general way to proceed ? ; Sure , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , ; just figuring out what needs to be done
Bmr016_62	No , I spoke with Jane about that ; and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that ; We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ? ; Yeah .
Bro019_328	Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; So ,
Bmr023_805	OK . ; And , uh , with the new machines it 'll be even better . ; So . ; Yeah . We get twelve of those ,
Bmr026_257	Yeah . ; So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr016_823	Um , yeah , ; which is ; And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ? ; I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it .
Bmr026_161	O K . ; Finally said he was too busy . ; I guess we reached it . ; Yeah , he he actually he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it .
Bed011_888	One could put scales in there . ; So I wanna know a lot about the history , ; just a bit . ; Yeah , right
Bro005_1198	Uh I don't know . ; OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single ; Yeah . ; Make stuff better .
Bro022_1077	and ; and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , ; or something like that . ; So maybe I 'll
Bmr020_399	Don't train ; Over the ; but you know . ; Hmm .
Bro004_1193	I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay ; but at the same time the LDA down here ; I don't know Wh ; what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ?
Bmr014_1231	It should be very rare . ; I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr028_993	No , actually ; No . You can run both . ; Yeah . ; And you can s
Bmr027_1090	OK , then you got , ; um , uh , ; instead of " from something - or - other cards " , it 's " for multicast " . ; And instead of " ANN system related " , it 's " end system related " .
Bro023_761	So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , ; which is like , everywhere I use the channel zero VAD . ; And that seems to be the best combination , uh , rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel . ; So I 'm I 'm still a little confused .
Bmr028_1781	Oh , you never have ? ; Oh , it 's a treat . ; You have to plug your ears or just prepare not to laugh . ; Right .
Bro003_1411	And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format , ; and HTK is an ASCII format . ; And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_120	In what order shall we proceed ? ; OK . ; Maybe you have your on - line ; Uh ,
Bed009_180	Mm - hmm . ; tells you how to get places . ; And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on . ; and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .
Bed008_1394	right ? ; Now this guy he looks at the value of H ; say it 's two , ; and then he just selects the uh thing .
Bmr005_1022	cuz they 're working on connected digits , ; so it 's ; Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , ; is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .
Bed006_460	By that look I ; Yes , uh , I would really p It would be better if I talked about it on Friday . ; OK . ; If that 's OK .
Bmr016_139	we 've done lots and lots of studies with that . ; And um . ; But it 's nice to get it in this room with the acous ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1418	So , Jane , what 's the d ; Maybe he died while dictating . ; so . ; I have one question about the the " EH " versus like the " AH " and the " UH " .
Bro004_269	Yeah . ; The only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual ; Um ; Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task .
Bmr016_2042	which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust , ; th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of " NUMS " where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . ; Right . ; Right . That would argue for changing the other ones to be " digits " or something .
Btr002_1587	Mm - hmm . ; but . ; And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , ; and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever ,
Bmr008_1599	This is ; Yeah . ; but I mean , if um u ; Yeah .
Bro019_1449	Is that out of the way ? ; Uh , no ; not yet . ; Uh , yesterday I called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from May thirtieth
Bmr008_1168	and then uh , Chuck was taking the role of saying , " well , what did you mean by that ? " , ; so he was sort of like the out s semi - outsider , asking curiosity questions . ; And then it would come back to me with saying " well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , " ; so it was very much sort of " Leader " and and and and " Led " sort of relationship .
Bns003_491	so like from people who have been here before ; and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there . ; So , that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be , um , shown or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_115	OK . ; That 's a little bit . ; Can I have something to write on the back of ? ; So , so where are we in this ?
Bmr016_826	I 'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it . ; Probably , yeah . ; But um , ; That 's typical , huh .
Bmr001_455	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1072	It would be similar similar to ; I knew some people who were uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia , ; right ? ; so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time ,
Bro004_495	So . ; OK , OK , gotcha . ; Hmm . ; OK , so if we take
Btr001_1805	Yeah . ; That 's where you f tend to find ; Mm - hmm . ; Interesting .
Bro005_1353	Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff ; and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the on the preparing all all the data for them to to um , train and to test on . ; Um ; Yeah . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class .
Btr002_3193	I always thought that was " or " sort of with a strange pronunciation . ; Oh . ; I 'm making a distinction . ; Oh .
Buw001_763	Um ; and not look at each other ; and not look at boards , ; and just all be sitting talking .
Bro010_442	uh , or one had a better VAD than the other ; since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , ; and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . ; It still wouldn't be perfect
Bmr001_658	Um . ; What are wh When are we Are we going to do that ? ; Who are they going to be ? ; What meetings are we going to record ?
Bmr028_13	Ah . That was the second thing . ; Right . Right . ; So should we simply assert that this week we are recognition , and next week data issues , ; Hmm .
Bed014_1046	No way ! ; Y you 'll come and take all the the headph the good headphones first and then remind me . ; W why do you ? ; Yeah , exactly .
Buw001_580	Yeah . ; Where you 've got fifteen peo ; I mean , most ; th this is one of the larger meetings .
Bro011_78	um uh let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds ; so ; uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_423	the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error ; yeah ; but ; So and what al also this means is that
Bro025_441	because in the proposal the neural net was also , uh , working on after frame - dropping . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Oh , that 's a real good point .
Bmr015_626	but , um , you know , I 've th the ; So , ; I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point . ; But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand
Bmr018_1096	Yeah , really . ; I think Morgan 's talk went very well it woke ; Excellent . ; you know , it was really a well presented and got people laughing
Bed012_738	And , um ; Killing , reasoning . What 's the difference ? ; Wait . So you 're saying , next Tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , ; or just us three working on it , or or ?
Bmr011_1675	Or people who are really h ; We should probably bleep that out . ; about about tax cuts or something . ; I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room
Bmr019_96	The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . ; And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking . ; Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1901	I think ; I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , ; and come up with a a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units , ; and
Bro024_105	But point three percent , uh , w from what to what ? ; That 's point three percent ; On The the the accuracies w went from it was something vaguely like ninety - five point six accuracy , um , improved to ninety - five point nine wh when I ; So four point four to four point one .
Bed010_818	We 're starting to do science , ; right ? ; And so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1316	Mmm . ; That 's sort of wide open . ; So we we can for we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , ; or focus more on the targets and on the training data
Bed003_878	Can we add , just so I can see how it 's done , uh , a " has door " property ; or ? ; OK . ; What would it , uh , connect to ?
Bed010_756	yeah . ; And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector . ; Yeah . ; What 's going on at the end of the tool ,
Bmr010_338	And , um , so my my goal was w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . ; And it 'll be I 'm I 'm I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . ; That 's great . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1585	because you 're having a sys you have a system , a dialogue system , where you only have access to the what the speaker said before . ; Yeah ? ; So it 'd have to be sort of a causal , uh , version of @ @ . ; Oh , yeah . That 's OK .
Bmr024_1418	Hmm . ; So ; Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something . ; OK .
Bro018_1134	I I 'm g I 'm guessing it was the the training data . ; Uh , clean TI - digits is , like , pretty pristine training data , ; and if they trained the SRI system on this TV broadcast type stuff , ; I think it 's a much wider range of channels
Bmr012_586	Oh ; or i have someone look at the alignments ; uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_722	So a ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ,
Bmr002_877	where did I get this ? ; I got this from U Penn . ; U Penn . ; I think that I 've heard of this one .
Bmr031_1249	Yeah . We 'll have it all straightened out . ; Yeah . ; So . It 's gonna be a busy week . ; Yeah .
Bro017_656	Mm - hmm . ; so ; so we were coming with all these f various lifters . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_94	end equals T - eighteen " . ; So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time . ; We don't know when it ends . ; OK .
Btr002_707	Yeah . ; and like not listen to them . ; I do remember those , actually . ; And then you see it ,
Btr001_798	Unlike like a " tuh " or a " kuh " that just stops . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro023_177	OK . ; Just There 's just inter - word silences . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they are , like , pretty short .
Bmr019_474	at least from the good one . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_90	or ? ; Oh . ; Uh , a little bit about ? ; Mmm .
Bro026_692	I I guess , I 'm not sure . ; I just ; No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . ; So I wouldn't
Bro012_1519	or I didn't have anything like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch , ; but I couldn't go anywhere .
Bro017_189	uh we may try some standard techniques like spectral subtraction and ; You haven't tried that yet ? ; not not not much . ; Hmm .
Bns001_392	Yeah , but this i ; so maybe you know more about it . ; Yeah , but this is th only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a s certain coverage of a certain subnet techn technology is available . ; And if so , then what Miguel mentions , then you add a certain kind of policy , to switch or not to switch , to this kind of technology ,
Bed014_475	or comes ; Right . ; is resolved later . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1120	I don't know eh uh i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . ; It would be interesting in itself to see . ; eh What , I I mean , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with ; Well , I think that would be an interesting result .
Bro017_441	So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first . ; Hmm . ; Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier . ; Hmm .
Btr001_1845	this is a a different kind of question , ; but I w ; from having listened to all these people , ; I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really .
Bmr003_2296	and I can certainly build it out of oak ; no problem , ; would it you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of ; I need a desk at home too , alright ?
Bro005_1029	And uh , take let 's say , just take uh multi - English ; cause that works pretty well for the training . ; Mm - hmm . ; And just look take that case and then look over all the different things .
Bro012_857	Oh , OK . ; Uh - huh . ; And so , in principle , you if you remove that source , then , you know , you can ; I see . OK .
Bro014_516	but with a voice activity detector . ; And apparently , uh , some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number . ; So they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_164	since it 's , you know , a recognizer 's gonna do better on those anyway , ; OK . ; um , and it 's more predictable . ; So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber , in general .
Bmr026_743	ummh . ummh . OK . ; And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I I think that 's a great idea .
Bmr027_684	I hadn't thought about that . ; OK . ; That for every meeting ; any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of .
Bmr026_145	I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera ; and also by the user ID . ; So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . ; Uh The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer .
Bro014_1555	OK . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , anything to add ? ; Um .
Bns002_995	This working group is is devoted to uh try to to present or to agree a common protocol for routing IP traffic on these eh kind of networks , ; on these ad - hoc networks , ; Uh , and ; at this moment there are , I would say , a lot of proposals of different protocols uh for uh end - to - end traffic
Bed008_921	Could be . ; you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the ; Yeah . ; Like situation traffic and so on .
Bro023_305	So , um ; So that 's The improvement is somewhere around , like , thirty percent over the baseline . ; Is that using in combination with something else ? ; No ,
Bro017_1244	should I say on a microphone ? ; uh some amount of money , not much . ; Not much I can say on a microphone . ; Much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work .
Bro003_434	Yeah . ; So , ; without without any licensing big deals , or anything like that . ; And , um , so we 've been talking about this this , uh , cube thing ,
Btr001_1094	Hmm . ; Other times just you figure you look at it and what 's the context . ; Yeah . ; It 's OK ,
Bdb001_1215	Yeah , I think it 's gonna be very hard . ; Any sort of structured anything when you try to merge is really , really hard ; Right . ; because you ha i
Bmr010_239	and w and so we had this meeting . ; Th - the also Adam , before the the before you went away . ; Uh we , um regarding the representation of overlaps , ; because at present , um , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using ,
Bmr028_1173	So I 've probably made I probably corrected something like , ; well , s ; It 's really a substantial amount of things that I 've caught , changed um , added to it . ; Including a lot of , uh , backchannels .
Bmr028_1148	But still ; Wow . Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_1387	Great . ; So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . ; Tell about ; I 'll be I 'll be working on this .
Bmr007_901	Yeah . ; And the the another question , that when I review the the the work of Javier . ; I think the , nnn , the , nnn , that the idea of using a neural network to to get a broad class of phonetic , eh from , eh uh a candidate from the the the speech signal . ; If you have , eh uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh only consider , eh like candidate , the , nnn , eh the silence , because it is the the only model , eh eh , he used that , eh eh nnn , to detect the the possibility of a a change between the between the speaker ,
Bed004_587	But it 's not construction there , it 's action . ; Construction is a d is a different story . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr006_1045	Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . ; Mm - hmm . ; So p ; And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net
Bro018_128	yeah . ; So uh ; So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate ; No
Bmr016_339	but you know ; Oh , you 're not . ; Not for adaptation , nope . ; v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on
Bro005_519	So . ; Oh , yeah . ; Well , so perhaps let 's let 's jump at the last experiment . ; It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output .
Bmr009_1603	I think if if if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's not a trivial task . ; OK .
Bro028_731	Yeah . Oh , yeah . ; That 's true . ; Yeah . ; And then we just use that to determine some scaling factor that we use .
Bmr029_814	And once you 've got those things , then you can start your processing . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr006_1801	Uh - huh . ; But it would be still useful for the ; But if both of those are publically available ; Yeah . That 's good .
Bmr008_1759	and I haven't problem . ; Did you typecast to long ? ; or size - T or whatever it is ? ; I don't remember what it is .
Bro027_1636	eventually we could could just ; Yeah , ; so Yeah , ; so that 's the
Bmr029_74	Um ; We have a whole parallel set of things over here which are all with digits . ; Mmm . ; I see .
Bro011_527	And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,
Bsr001_2445	And what are these what are the digit strings are from TI digits and , uh ; One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four . ; Uh ; Yeah ,
Bed016_1073	Of course that 's that that 's definitely a , uh ; Fixed . ; A fixed expression , yeah . ; that 's a , uh
Bed009_321	Hmm . ; So that 's a a discrete decision . ; Mm - hmm . ; There are only three possibilities and the uh
Bed004_593	For for for ; Yes . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro019_920	Yeah . ; and then make the noise white , ; Yeah . ; and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .
Bmr015_80	So the only thing I wanna say about digits is , we are pretty much done with the first test set . ; There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read . ; So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms ; and extract out pieces that are in error .
Bed014_337	One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings ; and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , ; you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , ; or any other one of these things
Bed013_149	Yeah . ; Which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . Right ? ; Eh , n ; Which is basically , " I don't know where something is and I need to go there " .
Bed009_608	and uh ; but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion . ; Or to enter his discussion , actually . ; That 's the way around .
Bmr020_1105	because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters . ; And to get an object You need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech . ; And that 's where your your data would be very important to have . ; So , I will
Btr001_1511	Um . ; They 're very fast . ; That 's amazing . ; Is l
Bmr031_1334	Um . But because , you know , the results are are still confusing enough that that , um , ; we we gotta be convinced we understand what 's going on . ; But it 's starting to look like it it 's almost the opposite of the usual th situation where , um , you get some really nice result with , uh with digits , say , ; and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away .
Bed005_922	Right . ; OK ? ; And then there 's a language generator , ; and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer .
Bsr001_365	and . ; I mean , ; apical - alveolar kind of thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_617	Mm - hmm . ; and , um If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . ; You wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say , in Switchboard data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1608	which makes it hard for the data to be used for all possible purposes . ; D Do you think the battery ran out ? ; That 's what I think . ; Or ?
Bmr009_495	If if you 're a I guess my point is , if you 're doing essentially a linear separation , taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So it 's So , uh if you i i So i if there if there close to things it does
Bed012_298	I 'm not drinking tea . ; What are you talking about ? ; Oh , yeah . ; Sorry .
Bed002_177	Either one of those . ; And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . ; So , the most important form is the consent form , ; so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent .
Bmr011_343	And so we wanna see what commonality there is here . ; You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things ; That would be cool . ; Yeah , that would be neat .
Bmr030_144	Yeah , he didn't ; But of course he doesn't use Windows . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr020_594	Yeah ; I I thought maybe Liz presented this at some conference a while ago about uh , backchannels ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1612	Not yet , ; because I did this in parallel , ; and I was working on one and the other . ; I see ,
Bns003_782	and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer , a bigger project um , outside of this goal , with contributions here from , uh first of all from the NSA group and then from from other partners . ; But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management ; and this will happened , I believe , in December , ; maybe , and in the beginning of January .
Bed003_735	We - what set the they set the context to " unknown " ? ; OK . ; OK . ; Right now we haven't observed it ,
Bmr018_316	Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section ; when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway . ; Right , ; That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part .
Bmr003_271	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; Right , ; but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC
Bmr030_589	I mean , it it 's not a big deal , ; but it 's yet another thing you have to do . ; Yeah , yeah . ; That 's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could ,
Bed013_880	and we 've ; I can't believe that that 's never been thought of before . ; Wait , what are the dots ? ; I don't remember what the dots were .
Bed017_612	Right . ; Well I mean if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German company , or ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed003_1807	Mm - hmm . ; and maybe some task where it 's more or less explicit ; that the person wants to take a picture , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_151	Hm - mmm . ; Um you have to do preindexing ; Good . ; and so that these tools do all that .
Bro013_579	they say that yesterday they are some problem ; But ; Yeah , but it 's not ; it 's ,
Bdb001_591	Um ; And so so this one would have , um , an ID is link link seventy - four or something like that . ; And then somewhere up here you would have a link that that , uh , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_478	Yeah . ; But I actually stuck most of this in our m last meeting with Guenter . ; Um , ; but I 'll just
Bmr012_924	And I guess if you 're comparing like uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that ; yeah . ; Why is that ? ; right ?
Bed006_366	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's like the Enter versus View ; Yeah , we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction , ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_893	So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum , ; but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary , ; sometimes this estimation can be , uh , too small , ; so you don't subtract enough .
Bro027_736	So this is almost ten percent . ; With the f with the neural net . ; Yeah , ; Yeah ,
Bed005_1132	I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take ; One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT . ; So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you , ; Mmm .
Bro023_689	but y but there you make different approximations , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor .
Bdb001_976	Well , I don't know . ; Is there anything else , ; like ; I mean that helps me a lot ,
Bro003_489	but at some point somebody should just show me the cube . ; It sounds s ; I I get I think I get the general idea of it , ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bed016_604	I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle , ; Mmm . Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; or as some physical object .
Bro024_1579	It 's just something that 's fixed . ; No . ; It 's overall . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_626	that ; I 'd like to see that reference too . ; It made me think about a cool little device that could be built ; OK .
Bmr016_2110	Yeah . ; So I 'd so " I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five " . ; And and actually , you know the language ; it 's the same point , actually ,
Bns002_569	S ; So what what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals . ; Yeah , ; but , Miguel , this is a good point from from Dietmar ,
Bro025_323	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So we I mean , if so if we if so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA ; So , the f the final delay 's now ba is f determined by the delay of the VAD ,
Bmr022_440	Well . ; I 'll talk to Brian , and see what he ; Yeah , single digit numbers ; That also appeals to me . So that you don't have to , you know
Bro014_1271	This moved in the ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; You go to a smooth representation .
Bed015_2093	um ; Bayes ? ; Bayes - net , ; OK .
Bmr031_93	our normal transcription status , ; just so that we can make some some plans . ; So wha what 's up with IBM , Chuck ? ; Do you know ?
Bmr002_1020	Yeah , they have a ; I vaguely recall that they have a pages uh tools page somewhere , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr019_1416	I think it 's a littl little far - fetched . ; Nah , I mean , the thing is Aurora 's pretty closed community . ; Yep . ; I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round ,
Bmr011_358	but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , uh , head models and microphone things . ; And so , uh , he 's he and possibly a student , there w ; there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , ; uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical .
Bro023_390	Forty percent is the high mismatch . ; OK . ; And that becomes like four point three ; Not changed .
Bro027_1131	For the training of the neural net . ; Mm - hmm . ; And ; is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch
Bmr019_1571	Depends how fast you can throw it . ; It seems like too many too much coming and going . ; It 's just ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_912	I mean like ; so ; So it 's it 's it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database ; Oh , I see ,
Bed006_481	but it would have been ; OK . ; but this this is I guess good news , ; and the uh the time
Bed012_180	You 're not gonna say " It 's It 's five hundred yards away from you " or " It 's north of you " , or " it 's located " ; Well , I mean But the there 's So you just have three decisions for the final node , that would link thes these three nodes in the net together . ; Um . ; I don't know whether I understand what you mean .
Bro004_1378	right ? ; If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything ; running through these a hundred times faster ; because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings ,
Bsr001_1993	cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that . ; Well , yeah , ; it 's a it 's ex excellent , excellent . ; Mmm , mmm .
Bmr011_439	but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . ; It 's premature . ; Fine . ; Good .
Bmr010_1536	even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it , it 's just sort of this general filter bank ; or or cepstrum or something , um ; Yeah . ; Eee it 's in there somewhere probably .
Bed003_524	Yeah . ; Like it 's a conjunction of , ; I don't know , ; you know , the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine
Bmr031_142	and at this point it 's not quite half . ; Wouldn't Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ? ; Yeah . ; And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver
Bmr007_898	Yeah . ; It 'll be much harder . ; Much harder . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_533	OK ? ; And also of course after spurt ends , ; which means basically in p inside pauses . ; So pauses are always an opportunity for
Bmr013_369	And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , ; uh , uh , ; I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . ; Yeah u I don't disagree with it
Bed014_1381	Yeah , it has to in the sense that you 're gonna use them eventu ; it 's you know , it 's sort of a , um , generate and test kind of thing , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; and if you over - generate then you 'll have to do more .
Bro015_201	I think so . ; I ; Mmm . ; I don't know .
Bro018_1001	Mm - hmm . ; So um ; That 's a difference that I don't think we put any way to get around , ; since it was an advantage .
Bmr030_349	Right . Right . ; Yeah . ; So , other topic is , uh , the IBM transcription status stuff . ; So we 've sent a few to them .
Bmr008_1783	Yeah , Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; but eh I I I don't know because eh eh it doesn't eh happen to me before .
Bmr011_1464	That 's important . ; So . ; Yeah , so I mean there 's possibilities there . ; I think Jerry 's group , yes .
Bmr031_1430	Um . And also we 're we 're using a couple of the labellers who are doing emotion to help us , um , finalize some transcripts for this . ; So these undergra undergrad students are really helping us out a lot , ; Yeah . ; under Don 's supervision , actually .
Bmr026_1216	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 'll have a very tiny effect . ; Right , because you used the context windows
Bmr020_1508	it 's probably in your paper that I haven't looked at lately , ; but ; Uh , an order of magnitude ; Certainty .
Bro010_321	So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there 's also
Bro021_1244	nnn ; when I develop this in s Taylor Taylor series , I can't , um , calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the Gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech . ; Now . ; And this is fixed .
Bro005_393	It 's still ; OK . ; Alright , go ahead . ; And then then
Bmr005_414	eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped . ; OK . ; This is the idea . ; But eh I I don't distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker .
Bro008_182	Like the day before you leave or something ? ; Uh , probably the day after they leave , ; but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr016_1185	Run it through ; I have a sed You know , so I do sed script saying whenever you see " gonna " you know , " convert it to gonna " , you know , " gloss equals quote going - to quote " , ; you know . ; And with all these things being in curly brackets
Bmr011_908	And then what he 's going to do is check it , ; Oh . ; a before they go be beyond the first one . ; Check it and , you know , adjust it , and all that .
Bed002_508	Right . ; Nuh ? ; But it 's not in there . ; Well , they they kee they keep it by their lights .
Bmr014_134	Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too . ; Yeah . ; Why why don't we do that . ; OK .
Bmr016_1146	And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . ; And if not , then that gets checked . ; Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called " spoken - forms " . ; So there
Bro028_1122	Um , so you could argue that in fact it ; But I I don't actually believe that argument ; because I know that , um , you can , uh ; computing features is useful ,
Bed002_990	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Just sort of
Bed003_170	That 's " saliency " , or the " salience " of an object . ; And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as " landmark - iness " . ; But it 's really not . ; I mean an object can be very salient
Bro027_366	Oh . ; So this is now it 's it 's compiled under Solaris ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr020_364	then of course you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here . ; Right . ; Right ? ; So we scored everything ,
Btr002_2841	yeah . ; I mean , if it 's a clarifying type like " well do you mean ? " when they 're partway through it in a utterance . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_765	And so we started to look at at um things like this , ; which is , ; well , it 's ; Yeah .
Bro018_1204	I mean , as helpful ; I mean , ; so that 's the question . ; Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that that isn't isn't sort of industry industry standard great ,
Bro005_727	Yeah . ; And uh it might be if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , ; once we get out of this particular rush uh for results . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1223	Then they should send that through ; Why why sh ; Well It 's sort of not really a question about permissions , ; but more of procedure .
Bns003_561	and I say " OK , ; there 's a potential . " ; " There are potential contacts . " ; currently , maybe no money ,
Bmr003_717	uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts . ; You know , yo ; Most of those are done by a person . ; Yeah ,
Bmr008_677	But you know , just have it you know , a short simple form that you can categorize yourself in a in a systematic way . ; What about the the phrasing that um Chuck used , uh which was in in relation to the question I was trying to formulate of uh Where where did you what ; what was that what w how did you phrase it ? ; What language was spoken in the home ?
Bro026_316	When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; And th the ranking actually didn't change after the German and Danish .
Bmr008_1087	Yeah . ; Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out . ; Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact . ; And this would and and we discussed this ,
Bmr006_1035	because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . ; That , you know , I I I think is the idea . ; And so eh the , nnn the the system eh will have two models . ; Clustering .
Bro013_106	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_1044	let me f th say what I think is is ; so the idea is uh first of all I misspoke when I said we thought you should do the constructions . ; Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly . ; So what I yeah , OK , So what what I meant was " Do a first cut at " .
Bro005_852	What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? ; Mmm . ; I don't I don't know . ; Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ?
Bro023_1662	Uh , I think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there . ; Mm - hmm . ; You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , uh , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_402	Yeah . ; Oh , that 's another cl cue , ; that 's true . ; yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who .
Bdb001_1004	we didn't do it at the API - level . ; We did it at the t tool - level . ; That that most many of them can s you can specify several P - files ; and they 'll just be done sequentially .
Bmr016_1837	they were said as letters . ; The others , um , e those really do need to be listened to ; cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , ; Right , exactly .
Bro004_874	yeah . ; So it 's using all the nets for that ; but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference , ; Yeah .
Bed010_209	and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . ; Right . ; OK . ; And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially ,
Bsr001_1849	Mmm , mmm . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yes ,
Bro024_1810	I don't know . ; Maybe it 's @ @ it 's possible to to have the same result . ; That 's somewhere ; I don't know exactly .
Bsr001_331	I noticed that . ; I don't @ @ ; But , you know , that that might be the challenging part . ; No , I wish .
Bmr025_673	Does this mean that the that this could be por uh ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of uh ; Yeah , basically uh I did install it on my laptop ; and yeah ; Wonderful .
Bns002_1580	maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available . ; So you have , in principle , here now the mapping of the different areas , um within GPS , ; and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS . ; There is no so much different .
Bed011_503	Hmm , mm - hmm . ; and then , what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity , you would expect . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I mean i it seem that um there is a difference between going to see something , and things like " exchange money " or " dine out "
Bmr010_1550	Mm - hmm . ; Using the the Gaussian . ; You mean Javier 's ? ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1287	OK . ; Yeah . ; What what ; That would be weird .
Bmr016_2156	He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data ; Yeah . ; and found segments that would be useful . ; And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done .
Bmr024_704	And and those and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup . ; Yeah . ; It 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . ; It 's got a different purpose .
Bed003_1564	The " outer layer " ? ; Just observable nodes , ; evidence nodes ? ; The features ,
Bns002_1267	because they can say " OK , hundred meters is is is an acceptable distance , ; let 's say , for communicating inside a building , inside a a small office . ; So , uh some people , I think , is being tempted to think that Bluetooth could provide them uh , some kind of local connectivity , ; but uh for for data for computing uses .
Bmr026_643	I thought you are ; Yeah ; so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . ; OK .
Bmr031_1300	And so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually integrate the posteriors that they get from their language model for every word boundary or every frame boundary , ; and then train up the classifiers . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_663	that 's that 's at ; Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte . ; So , the real case ? ; However you know , it The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities
Bro004_299	So it 's band - limited TIMIT . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is all eight kilohertz sampling .
Bed013_378	or is it a ; Um , well it 's more ; It 's both , right ? ; It 's it 's sort of t cognitive , neural , psycho , linguistic ,
Bmr012_1234	I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten . ; Uh it 's great ; So they 're still working . ; Pretty close ,
Bed008_1056	Before we get more into details . ; The organization is going to be that uh ; the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh ; as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use
Bns002_866	And it is very simple to see that some advantages can some advantage can be obtained , ; because the difference is eh if you don't have power control , you are using all the time the maximum power , ; if you have power control , sometimes you will use less than the maximum power ; How often do you use less power than the maximum ?
Bmr018_695	and we can hear everything Morgan says . ; Hmm . ; But and and some of what you I mean , you also appear quite a bit in that cross - talk . ; So , I actually went through all of those ,
Bns002_641	For example , you have one big station with uh a lot of transmission power , ; and then you have a really small mobile uh thing that can hear perfectly the signal from this uh uh bigger station , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , a cellular phone and a car .
Bmr020_422	So we have to ; um ; I mean , you still ; Well I should bring the should bring the table with results .
Bmr007_594	I mean ; Uh a vote vote in Florida . ; It 's been studied a lot . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_999	because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was just , doing a minus R star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1027	With my backchannel ? ; Yeah , with your backchannels . ; Uh - huh . ; Because sometimes you have this sort of this this " uh - huh " that you don't n
Bro023_1663	Mm - hmm . ; You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , uh , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1702	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing , um , clicks like from African languages ? ; Yes . ; Oh my .
Bns002_1411	That 's the proper answer . ; Th - this one ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed015_2166	No , there isn't a theorem prover ; but there but but the , um , The cove the the P R Ms are like rules of inference ; and you 're you 're coupling a bunch of them together . ; Mm - hmm , yeah .
Bmr018_976	I mean if it 's just as easy , ; but ; uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , ; so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop
Bro028_399	But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal . ; There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away . ; And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in . ; So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in ,
Bmr031_868	OK . ; Just not yet approved for ; But not yet approved . ; Yeah ? OK .
Buw001_1360	By so by going around ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it ,
Bdb001_1187	There 's , uh , automatic , uh , punctuation and stuff like that . ; Because we had one set of annotations that were based on , uh , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation , ; and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . ; So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical .
Buw001_325	That 's a nice idea . ; Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad ; It ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1817	These are so funny to read . ; Well , of course now the the Tannen corre the spelling c change . ; So . ; Uh , that 's what gets I I picked those up in the frequency check .
Bmr028_1729	Yeah . ; because of the f you know , the batteries flaked . " ; Well , we 'll just We 'll we 'll just have to note those . ; I 'd mu We 're I 'd much rather have , you know , meetings that have all the channels ,
Bns003_670	well I I will be able to to do some work from Spain too . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , that 's my future uh forecast . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bed002_750	Um , so it 's just ; Yeah . ; But It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . ; So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality ,
Bmr029_597	OK . ; I 'll ask ; So ? ; The other thing is , um
Bro014_475	but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions . ; And that 's ; uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1142	Back at ; You mean with soft targets ? ; Or ? ; Sorry , I 'm sor
Bro010_496	Yeah . ; or ; Really ? ; Yeah .
Bmr001_721	We could we could have the reading group in here . ; Yeah , I mean it 's a different style . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_362	Yeah . ; However , they do have software these days which with a digitized uh record you can have control over replay through some sort of an interface . ; Yeah . ; Um . I 've never used one of those .
Bmr008_1148	but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting , ; yeah . ; Yep . ; or ,
Bro021_1147	for the to get this mapping ? ; I don't know exactly . ; Yeah . ; I I need to s
Bsr001_786	you know , ; it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it , ; and so it 's We we haven't thought it through . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_273	Excuse me . ; but it 's running under Windows . ; Under Windows . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_706	and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we 're talking about two different things . ; We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there , ; and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema , down there . ; Uh one question , Robert .
Bmr020_1870	As I say , we 'll just have to listen to it and see how horrible it is . ; Yeah , e ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1087	and were there tools for that ; because um I suspect that would be uh pretty time intensive . ; I also wanted to say , in terms of like disc you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours I do have a certain amount of background in that ; and I really would be I 'd like to be involved in that .
Bmr006_654	OK . ; Right . ; Right . ; Do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ?
Bed005_1148	So there 's no numbers . ; There 's just quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs . ; I i i ; No , no But I 'm saying is There There is a w
Bro003_571	Uh , yeah , ; superset , ; Yeah . Yeah . ; yeah .
Bmr008_377	so maybe you 'll prefer to ; I I think is not ; The the mean of the estimates from the group will be used ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1026	Well , I mean , ; It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects , ; I I belie I believe there is a lot of overlap ; There i
Bro022_972	Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , ; but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . ; Um . ; On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise
Bns001_758	and also if you see the end - to - end scope of the internet , from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server , " correspondent node " , or whatever you call this destination , then you have certain kind of models , for instance , for the quality of service and all these kind of things . ; And then is UMTS only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology . ; And you have to match these things anyway . ; It 's like a normal ethernet .
Bro003_416	Or is ; I think ; I don't know anything about Finnish . ; well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family .
Bro014_1384	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But
Bro017_868	Then you decide that you want to see how important C C - one is . ; So what you will do is that a component in the model for C - one , you will divide it by by two . ; And you will compress your test data by square root . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_483	OK . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , ; I mean , those listening to this will not have a picture either ,
Bed005_380	Hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm . ; Grep for it ? ; Yeah . Let 's do that . ; Oh .
Bed006_71	And um , is there anyone who doesn't know Nancy ? ; Do you do you know Nancy ? ; Me ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1316	So , I think you 're gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac accuracy . ; So long as those words are in your vocabulary . ; Well , it definitely helps with , um , forced alignment , too , ; One percent .
Bmr005_664	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed014_647	I wanna " ; " Here 's my plan for today . ; Here 's my plan for tomorrow . " ; Yeah , or Yeah , in the morning morning I I 'm planning t to go shopping ,
Bmr023_837	which didn't have any of the ; Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent . ; Uh . ; Right ?
Bro017_489	Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; We get this sort of improvement ,
Bmr028_1181	Mm - hmm . ; Well , we we have a frozen we do all our experiments with a frozen version of the transcripts as of , I don't know ; As of February ? ; A a as of
Bed017_609	Mmm . ; Right . ; But ; Right .
Bed005_1489	p Sure . ; Yeah , I I would like a copy , ; y y yeah . ; OK .
Bmr030_442	Plug it into the sound card . ; hit record , ; on the tape deck , ; Yeah .
Bmr030_734	and then I 'll either create a sub - directory for , like if it 's Meeting Recorder project , or Hub - five or whatever . ; So we c ; I just have to create those sub - directories , ; OK .
Bed004_289	um , the linguistics students and stuff . ; So my idea on on Wednesday is partly to uh ; you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine . ; You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . "
Bed012_803	Is that what the Keith node is ? ; Yep . ; OK . And you 're taking it out ? for now ? ; Or ?
Bmr006_608	SPINE . ; And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . ; So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . ; So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK .
Btr002_733	Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " , ; and I could tell because of the way it looks ! ; Yeah . ; Or " someone 's about to laugh really loudly " ,
Bmr031_1578	because then you 're gonna have zero everywhere . ; Right ? ; So you 'd have to normalize it based on the ; No , ev everything for that speaker .
Bns001_348	But probably , the user wants to be aware that he 's switching from one place from one network to another . ; Because maybe , while he 's uh having , let 's say , a vide video conference uh over the the WaveLAN oh he 's not paying any extra cost . ; But when he continues with this service on the UMTS , he 's having to cover uh an important let 's say , an important cost or some cost , non - null cost . ; Yeah ,
Bmr026_1047	But ; But . ; I mean should should we even use that ? ; Oh oh that 's a good question .
Buw001_916	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's sort of Landay supplying it ; so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . ; Right .
Bed016_1043	uh ; Well , I I I ; How about " I 'm in a hurry " ? ; State .
Bro005_846	and the effect of training on something that 's Viterbi - aligned instead of hand hand - labeled . ; Yeah . ; So . Um . ; Yeah .
Bns001_368	because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services . ; And that should not be done automatically . ; But it could be done automatically . ; But nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible , that you could set up a certain kind of mini - database how to deal with all these kind of things .
Bmr023_134	Are you implying that it 's currently disorganized ? ; In my mind . ; Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the SRI recognizer et cetera , ; tho those things that were happening before with ?
Bmr021_780	So without and with adaptation . ; How many iterations ? ; For the adaptation ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_273	Makes perfect sense . ; Yes . ; Hmm , ah . ; but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition
Bns003_959	they still have there that tunnel generations and all those kind of things ; and I I believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the really uh , mobile scenarios in in that network , ; so but anyway we have to live with a real situation ; and that means we have to drop Multicast from the proposal .
Bmr026_718	Yeah , so on even weeks have basic on data . ; Yeah . ; We could do that , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_38	Um , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion . ; Uh , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points ; and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way ; and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave .
Bro017_1078	so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service ; right ? ; Ugh ! ; And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village
Bro022_998	Actually , it 's , ; uh ; Uh . ; I don't know ,
Bro005_122	Mm - hmm . ; But ; um this this net performed quite well . ; Well ,
Bed003_259	Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up . ; No one knows it . ; OK . ; So this right what we
Bro003_2016	I mean , if your net is gonna be outputting , uh , a vector of basically of ; well , it 's gonna have probabilities , ; but let 's say that they were ones and zeros , ; then y and you know for each ,
Bro003_1495	So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , you you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do don't want to have the the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being where the computation 's being done if you can help it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_864	Compared to these numbers , yeah . ; Um , ; like , on the well - match and medium mismatch , the gain is around five percent relative , ; y
Btr001_834	There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle . ; And ; if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it . ; It was written as something else ,
Bro017_308	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So there 's a very high correlation . ; So the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it .
Buw001_517	So ; What I I think , you know , in most meetings , ; this one being different , ; but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop
Bed016_242	That 's the not the construction parser . ; OK . ; That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , ; Easy parser .
Bsr001_2389	just look at the very last look at the very end . ; Just from that . ; Right , ; Yeah .
Bro017_601	We 've fff done some strange things like removing C - zero or C - one from the the vector of parameters , ; and we noticed that C - one is almost not useful at all . ; You can remove it from the vector , it doesn't hurt . ; Really ? !
Btr002_979	I 'm so scared . ; Like I I won't hold shift down ; To to hold shift down while you 're backspacing ? ; Like
Bed006_531	unless there are more questions on that . ; So , no sample generator output yet ? ; No . ; OK .
Bro005_1324	Um , but um , uh , ; we only have limited time ; and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . ; Mmm .
Bns003_75	OK . ; Yeah , it 's ; and and OK , maybe it 's a little bit ; but i but it 's not not , um very , uh difficult or something like that .
Bmr005_292	Uh - huh . ; I sorta knew I was doing it but it was ; Well , I still don't know who " he " is . ; I I do I don't remember who " he " is .
Bmr010_806	One more remark , uh , concerning the SRI recognizer . ; Um . ; It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath , ; and also laughter is very , very frequent and important to to model .
Bro027_427	So . ; Yeah , it was actually ; No . ; Not
Bmr007_1060	Yeah . ; you know , what I mean , ; Yeah . ; there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures .
Bns002_1462	So the point is um to reduce the overall picture , which I described in a few words , to the fact that we have really some work packages where we can focus on it , ; still fitting into the big picture . ; Yeah ? ; And so that will be the task of the next weeks .
Bns001_84	Not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside , ; but , the technical problem . ; But that 's under the s second topic , ; so first I would like that Miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background .
Bmr007_1163	Yeah , well . ; I 'll try to phrase it in passive voice . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bro024_314	so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bmr010_1047	The other thing we could do , actually , uh , is , uh , use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps . ; And ; Oh , that 'd be so super . ; They would be so s so terrific .
Bmr008_1457	So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel recordings . ; Ah . ; I I don't study the single channel yet ; but eh is eh is an idea .
Bmr018_758	I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now , ; so . ; Well less than a week . ; So um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point .
Bro023_1555	so if the the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track better track the noise , ; Mm - hmm . ; which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector . ; So even if there are no no speech pauses , you can track the noise level .
Bro013_575	Mmm . ; And and uh . ; you have read up and you have a paper , the paper that you s give me yesterday . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed015_687	If you walk " in " , like well , in what ? ; You know , like you have to have the So so it 's only semantically is it ; Right , there 's ; it is still required , say , by simulation time though
Bmr025_887	I mean , as you said . ; I mean for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , ; M ; right .
Bmr013_1011	And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . ; It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , ; so we 'll see if it 's any good . ; But , uh , I think it 's promising .
Bmr028_412	It 's hard to find anything that you say in these . ; Yep . ; Great . ; Well , thanks for the filter .
Bed005_1406	We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then interface to them with our own code . ; Well , I me ye eh , yeah , the ; That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess . @ @ . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute .
Bro026_905	I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics . ; So , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . ; And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , screwing up on this distinction . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_470	Mm - hmm . ; we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . ; And we were getting these terrible results . ; And then we were talking to somebody and they said , " Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ?
Bsr001_1840	and they don't ; it 's hard for them to give us money ; but they they seem to be willing to give us time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_553	Do you track , um , when people log in ; to look at the ? ; Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . ; Uh - huh .
Bed010_1089	Right . ; right . ; So let 's do this , ; and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co
Bmr003_2408	That 's that 's what it does , ; OK , ; great , ; yeah .
Bmr006_1258	OK . ; Wherever you are , even if he moves around . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . OK , it just it just seemed to me that uh , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .
Bed004_688	um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one , ; and so um we we may wanna decide we can do this from here , ; but we also could do it um you know if we have a a a belief - net interface . ; So the belief - net takes as input , a vector ,
Bmr015_230	But ; and , since this was something that Liz asked for specifically , I think we need to defer to her . ; I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_651	b ; This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? ; Yeah . ; Well , I mean , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check .
Bmr026_1083	Although , I mean we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . ; Uh . ; Which I 've never figured out . ; Right .
Bmr025_289	And then you get they then you get the Windows media playing for free . ; Well that 's Snack , not not Transcriber . ; Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality ; Yeah , yeah , I mean , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack .
Bed005_1179	eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be . ; And it 's it 's sort of not a great estimate , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's the best one you have ,
Btr001_1220	Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF , ; that 's the Tigerfish . ; Right . ; T
Bmr006_119	Mm - hmm . ; Definitely . ; Yeah . ; Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .
Bro013_747	It 's OK . ; OK . ; Alright . ; I mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , " O " and " zero " .
Bmr008_1417	so the um just one more clarifying question ; On the overlap category , is that overlapping of speakers only ? ; Yeah . ; It doesn't include some of the other sounds ?
Bmr003_787	Yeah . ; Oh , interesting point . ; I would have thought so , ; yeah .
Bmr010_412	Yeah . ; That 's true . ; Yeah , ; but that 's that 's OK ,
Bed011_721	but , ; will we have bic ; I mean is this realistic ? ; I mean
Bro013_298	OK . ; That was that topic . ; What else we got ? ; Um .
Bmr019_1771	Mmm . ; Ah . ; Oh . ; Nice .
Bed005_728	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; You have proper names , and descriptions . ; Right .
Bmr029_645	the so , the waveform names have the , you know , meeting meeting ID , ; and the microphone , ; and the , um ; I guess , the channel and the microphone and the speaker , um , speaker
Bmr006_1583	And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , ; Yeah , I was too . Yeah . ; and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . ; Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse .
Bro027_359	Uh ; But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually , ; but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . ; OK .
Bed015_1702	Mm - hmm . ; And I 'm sure gonna read the transcript of this one . ; So . ; But the , uh , But it 's too bad that we don't have a camera .
Bed002_1243	So this is the time difference between Germany . ; I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . ; Now , um Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . ; And so that we have it .
Bmr011_1010	whether to ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; so .
Bdb001_478	And so it seems to me that if if we want to use that , we might as well go directly to what they 're doing , rather than ; If we want to ; Do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_1516	It sounds so hard . ; Yeah . ; It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , ; and we don't know exactly how they do it
Bns002_506	So , even the at - the - moment - ongoing transmission . ; Mm - hmm . ; Is that right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1558	Mm - hmm . ; but it 's ; I I don't recognize a lot of these . ; you know how are how are they gonna know ?
Bdb001_1172	So ; So the the the point is ; Should should we mention some names on the people who are n ? ; Right .
Bmr020_152	Uh - huh . ; But any any help you need I can certainly provide . ; Well , ; Yeah .
Bmr014_852	Whole utterances only . ; Whole utterances . ; And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh ; it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level .
Bmr003_1216	they 're not gonna re provide repairs , ; they 're not gonna provide ; they they may or may not provide speaker ID . ; So that we would have to do our own tools to do that .
Bns002_1484	So I think everybody should consider carefully , based on this statement I made uh next steps ; and of course everybody has little bit other work to do ; but it should be should be always an ongoing process until I will leave until the tenth of December . ; You mentioned um six partners of this um work .
Btr002_1820	Mm - hmm . ; or sort of a mock - this or mock - that , ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr011_241	When we 're doing ; Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_359	so that so the issue is in in a situation where th that 's ; Well , it 's not really " nice " . ; It depends what you 're doing . ; So if you were actually having ,
Bmr029_967	Something like that . ; Are you are you interfacing to that thing with the C - plus - plus ; Or are you is there another interface that you use ? ; For w for Festival ?
Bed010_124	OK . ; And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together . ; That 's fine . ; It 's eee messy
Bmr026_526	Yeah . ; Wa - a I know what they want . ; The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . ; Yeah .
Bro017_762	Exactly . ; That 's what you do . ; That 's what you do , you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained . ; Yeah .
Bro010_723	but , ; you know , stationary ; is it very useful ; Very slow adaptation .
Bmr006_1526	Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want ; I I don't think you understood what I what I said . ; OK . ; So uh , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says " So , Roger , what do you think ? "
Bmr007_161	But the numbers speak for themselves . ; He 's Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK . ; Well , you know , it 's like I 'm not I 'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse
Bdb001_255	But but but most of the frames are actually not speech . ; So , ; you know , people don't ; Yeah ,
Bed002_811	Or after the fourth . ; Some find @ @ Forget that for now . ; And then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , ; but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ?
Btr001_1835	Mm - hmm . ; Uh ; Mm - hmm . ; But then there are some people who are Even if they 're not actually speaking , you can tell they 're more involved or interested or something ,
Bro022_395	was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? ; It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits . ; Oh . ; So that was done already .
Bed010_85	but the whole system was designed to work with this thing ; and it was It was a lot of engineering stuff . ; No science in there whatsoever , ; but it 's working now ,
Btr002_960	if I were to add an option , it might be to have an undo for that . ; Yeah . Yeah ! ; Oh , that 'd be good . That would be good . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_961	Speech researchers ? ; Uh , yeah . ; And Yeah , r right . ; Speech research .
Bmr012_200	um ; Was it twenty minutes in , ; I forgot about that . ; if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know
Bro012_326	I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so you know in trying to run these experiments I notice , you know , it 's difficult to find machines , you know , compute the run on .
Bro024_1348	Or ; I just took their entire Italian training part . ; Yeah . ; So it was both channel zero plus channel one .
Bed012_881	And , um , ; then ; should we start on Thursday ? ; OK .
Bro027_597	Uh ; No . ; There is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the LDA . ; Um , so the delta at the end is how much ?
Bmr021_1009	Cuz there 's little background noise . ; The question is , when the software detects it , what do you want it to do ? ; Exactly . ; That 's a good question .
Buw001_332	It 's ; but that doesn't ; Maybe I 'm missing something , ; but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?
Bmr019_425	We we we think that this has spikes on it , ; It 's this thing 's This is too big for my head . ; so it 's not as good acoustically , ; Yeah , basically your ears are too big .
Bro024_423	Yeah , ; OK . ; Um , so for the past , uh , week an or two , I 've been just writing my , uh , formal thesis proposal . ; Um , so I 'm taking this qualifier exam that 's coming up in two weeks .
Bsr001_349	OK . ; You 're a very soft whistler , ; you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , ; Actually , I use something like this on on the telephone and it 's very comfortable .
Bmr024_529	Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . ; And , uh , they 're doing a travel task . ; And , uh , it involves starting I believe starting with a ; It 's it 's always the wizard ,
Btr002_2018	OK . ; Yeah . ; In a way they 're more fun , though . ; Takes a long time .
Bmr020_1094	OK . ; In any case , this this uh , meeting that I hand ; I I hand - adjusted two of them ; I mentioned before ,
Bmr009_1573	I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there . ; And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening . ; OK . ; And it 's also also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing is proposed to the
Bed014_407	Yeah . ; But like ; Right . ; There 's The group as a whole knows
Bmr016_936	Then it 's fine . ; Right . ; But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on ; Oh yeah .
Bro003_1020	so , I mean , ; you don't wanna , ; uh ; Let 's see ,
Bed005_2	 ; Yeah , I think I got my mike on . ; OK . ; Let 's see .
Bmr022_1386	Or overlooked or not overlooked . ; Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous , ; and um , uh , um , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_530	Yeah . ; No , we got a Japanese version , ; you know that 's that 's it , ; Sorry .
Bmr021_25	That 's right . ; Yeah right . ; I much prefer these . ; Yep .
Bmr001_133	Right . ; Are we gonna I mean , is it gonna be over there , or is it gonna be in there ? ; Um , it 's it 's gonna b it 's for reasons because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there . ; There 's more equipment in there .
Bro025_723	Um , silence was by its own self . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , um , v vocalic was clustered . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_182	Hmm . ; I have a question on protocol in these meetings , ; which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? ; You know , the Jimlet
Bmr023_160	w using the warp factors that we computed for the SRI system and just applying them to the ICSI front - end . ; That 's pretty funny . ; Yeah . ; So you just need to copy over to this one .
Bsr001_430	It 's too hard . ; It 's too hard without ; Do you think this is going to be too f too ; Right .
Buw001_1145	you and I need dis Uh , ; And you and I need to ; no , we did the Liz talk . ; Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk .
Bsr001_2330	Right . ; Yeah , we 're doing digits ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_297	So , they 're very competitive , ; and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals , ; and we we , uh , got through that . ; And so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal .
Bmr023_553	uh , the ; Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up . ; then it becomes ; That it was the transcrip
Bro026_931	Right . ; They 're both orthogonalizing . ; But , you know ; and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves .
Buw001_484	It 's it 's not ideal , ; but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . ; So I was I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get ; w We have this collection of meeting .
Bro004_1058	Training , with the training test of each ; You understand me ? ; No . ; Yeah ,
Bro011_255	It 's my ; Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , ; I know this is mine here . ; Oh yeah ?
Bmr018_1634	Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter , ; but it it matters more in some situations than in others , ; and it and also there 's there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways . ; I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using ,
Btr002_1023	Oh , oh ! ; So you wanna backspace and you get apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe , apostrophe . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro014_601	And so ; I don't s ; having the baseline be the MFCC 's means that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD ; But they seem like two separate issues .
Btr002_772	yeah , when I realized , I I meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal ; cuz that 's that 's saved me a bunch of times . ; Gives some good clues , ; yeah .
Bmr027_1423	especially since ; so ; Yeah . Well , I 'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow , ; so this is just a good example of the sort of thing I 'd like to hear about .
Bro014_440	but if you if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation , ; and and and it 's a really big performance drop . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know ,
Bmr011_1095	If you do a forced alignment on something really ; Got uh six sixty minutes of ; well even if you do it on something really long you need to know ; you can always chop it up
Bro005_176	uh ; I don't know what exactly . ; Perhaps the fact that the the there 's no low - pass filter , ; well ,
Bmr009_1511	And this 'll be a hav having the multiwave will be a big help ; So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it . ; cuz in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr021_632	I won't ; Yeah , ; I 'm not sure whether that 's right . ; one one can imagine that that might be problematic .
Btr001_1328	Right , ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; OK , ; yeah .
Bro007_55	Um . So this is ; OK so that 's that 's this bottom one . ; yeah ; And so uh and then the the the one at the top
Bed008_274	No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge ; and doesn't really matter which way you cross ; which where you end up at the end ; but the part the good part is walking over it ,
Bmr014_518	And the other one didn't . ; And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . ; Right . ; When
Bmr006_1303	Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . ; i i ; There we go . ; Right .
Bed003_272	mainly because it 's it 's just whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a Vista verb . ; Yeah , ; that one needs a lot of ; And are those mutually exclusive sets ?
Bmr003_1675	and if there are five five people speaking at once , ; Right , i it 's ; I didn't explain it well . ; If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention .
Bro005_810	because , ; um , ; I I I don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency . ; Well , the TIMIT network is still the best
Bmr028_1023	W well , you have distance , and you have ; That 's it 's not enough . ; I mean , that , um , Jane 's i n The pickup of Adam on this mike is gonna be different than me , in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting . ; Oh , so just from clustering . You might be able to cluster it better because of that .
Bmr021_436	yeah . ; And if you have , you know , twenty channels and only five speakers , then it 's ; That 's true . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_636	Cars run into telephone poles all the time . ; well , or " into the cafe " for that m ; you know ; Right .
Bed010_779	I once I I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? ; Right , yeah yeah yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So you can insert your hand something
Bmr027_765	Yeah . ; like . ; Did you read that paper ? ; No .
Bmr023_783	No . ; But , uh , we s just , um , ; uh ; you know , Chuck and I talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @ to to this to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all .
Bns003_708	But , uh , it is not a research work . ; Usually it 's an application work . ; So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1142	Yep , SAX . ; SAX . Yeah . ; Cuz it 's much faster than DOM and uses less memory . ; Right . Right .
Bed003_192	Right ? ; Right . ; But ; Yeah .
Bed002_933	And she 'll be in touch . ; So we may have someone , uh , to do this , ; and she 's got you know , some background in in all this stuff . ; And is a linguist st
Bro007_489	we can still do some work on Wednesday morning . ; yeah well . ; Yeah , well . ; W i is but is is it midni I thought it was actually something like five PM on
Bmr028_1320	because , you know , whe when we know the the the true words and we 're adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings , especially the like , the front - end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them , that is not represented in Switchboard or CallHome , then it then it really helps . ; Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are . ; So ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1062	and I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features ; uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the SRI system , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1131	We have different languages , ; we have different different noises , ; Um If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps with them . ; And put put them together .
Bns002_595	We are assuming all the nodes are exactly the same . ; OK . ; Uh , so they transmit the same power , ; and they uh have the same uh uh sensitivity .
Bed015_1613	Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there , ; so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_616	but there is also the um special session about th Aurora ; which is uh which has an extended deadline . ; So . ; The deadline is in May .
Bro025_369	Mmm . ; Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually . ; So , ; Oh .
Bdb001_141	and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , um , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got a new recognition output , ; or s sort of what 's the , um , sequence of going from the waveforms that stay the same , the transcripts that may or may not change , and then the utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change ? ; Oh , that 's ; That 's actually very nicely handled here
Bmr029_121	Uh . Actually , I don't know . ; I 'd I I can look it up . ; It 's it 's it 's just , ; uh , I don't know the remember the the number .
Bro018_1035	but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So .
Btr001_2097	you know , ; gets coffee , ; Right . Right , right . ; comes back ,
Bro012_261	on other test set or it ; Yeah . ; Right . We only tested it on the the medium mismatch , ; on the other training set , I mean .
Bmr016_1461	I 'm just these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting . ; I know . ; We should go off - line . ; Well , we 're not doing We 're not doing length .
Bmr016_2127	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , ; yeah , I I like the idea of having this in there ,
Bro011_334	And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . ; for ; Right . ; And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that
Bro021_295	Mmm . ; I see . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1047	Yeah . ; But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on ; Mm - hmm . ; I always forget th
Bed014_856	I this is I 'm shocked . ; This is the first time I 've seen a thesis proposal change . ; Right . Anyway , uh . So . ; Really ?
Bmr003_1056	Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems . ; But certainly for this problem we can do a lot better than ; Bec ; Why ?
Bmr007_1133	So this is the things that I think we did in the last three months ; obviously not everything we did but but sort of highlights that I can can tell s some outside person , you know , what what were you actually working on . ; Um in no particular order uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from from , uh three months ago . ; Uh XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to IBM .
Bmr031_220	Cool . ; Um . ; Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation w on the test set . ; No , supervised adaptation .
Bed014_986	Do you want to meet again here bef ; I mean w ; Is the Speech - Gen meeting still at on Tuesdays ? ; Well , actually we w we we did scrap our Monday time just because Bhaskara couldn't come Monday .
Bdb001_701	Yeah . ; But the phrase is not part of the sentence ; and neither is the sentence part of the phrase . ; Right .
Bro014_1339	OK . ; I have here the same frame for the clean speech ; Cool ! ; Oh , that 's clean .
Bns003_1040	So ; Any other question ? ; Any other comment ? ; Oh .
Bmr006_108	Right . ; As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . ; I 'd like to have many different speakers . ; So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and uh ,
Bmr031_577	You just get , like , one backchannel at a time or something . ; yeah . ; Oh , it 's shortened . ; even even a distribution of fifty gigs ,
Bro026_773	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on .
Bed016_845	The the " the syrup spread out " ? ; That kind of thing ? ; Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_351	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm ? ; So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , ; and it may be a lot more but i it may it may not be .
Bed003_701	Well the I kind of thought of " doing business " as more of running an errand type thing . ; Yeah . ; Business on the other hand is , uh , definitely what you 're doing . ; So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT
Bed006_526	They 're very dependent ; Not unless you really want to . ; And they 're both nice guys ; so you may may want to .
Bed011_543	Right ? ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'm also interested in th in this " property " uh line here ,
Bro018_498	uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training . ; So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want . ; And uh it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1191	Mm - hmm . ; Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's it 's like I was thinking of type constraints ; but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema . ; " Agent " , I mean , the the performer of the X - schema ,
Bmr016_396	Let 's try it . ; You read the last line , I 'll read the first line . ; OK . ; Oh !
Bro023_279	um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So , uh I mean , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels .
Bed004_715	So this may be a a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net , ; and then ; Yeah . ; I think that 's I think that 's exactly right .
Bmr013_185	yeah . ; And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_945	Mm - hmm . ; and apply another another algorithm , another approach like , eh eh detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to to consider that , eh that , eh zone . of s a small silence between speaker , ; or another algorithm to to process , eh the the segment between marks eh founded by the the the BIC criterion and applied for for each frame . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1090	Yeah . ; because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting ; and we 're already short on disk space . ; Yeah .
Bed013_899	Us . ; But what is it ? ; Well , in the moment it 's a Bayes - net . ; And it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces .
Bed008_1017	But that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from ; a ; Right . ; That all that that kind of decision making happens at the Go - there node .
Bro018_1172	but there 's still this kind of ratio . ; It 's something like five percent error with the the distant mike , ; and one percent with the close mike . ; OK .
Bed002_412	So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . ; And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . ; And , then the question is ; there are two questions
Bmr016_1260	I 'm still doing the overview . ; I haven't actually gotten here yet . ; Oh I 'm sorry . ; OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , um , more abbreviated one to the left .
Bro004_1266	Hmm . ; But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . ; Yeah . ; We c we can find out .
Bed006_663	definition . ; The idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema ; such as the Source - Path - Goal ; and then we have forced uh motion ,
Bmr012_731	U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , ; um I don't know who , I mean how this was done ; but is is there are there any um issues with downsampling ; Don did this .
Bro023_1048	we 've ; which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering . ; I mean , that was I just well , like the overall improvement is like fifty - six point five . ; Right .
Bed005_798	And this is It seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l this is special case in that sense . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; I don't know .
Bro014_106	and it 's a real simple change to make . ; I mean , it 's like one little text file you edit and change those numbers , ; and you don't do anything else . ; Oh , this is a
Bed013_1116	but then so basically it 's just a for every construction we have a node in the net , right ? ; And we turn on that node . ; Yeah . ; Oy .
Bmr006_891	Yeah . ; Right . So Fine . Go on . ; Is is is only ; Yeah .
Bmr028_550	Or you can Yeah . You can use the one with one second or whatever . ; Do you mean a ? ; I I I There 's no not much difference between the the one - second and the two - second one . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1636	um , about getting the data . ; Who should I email ? ; Uh , how quickly do you want it ? ; Um .
Bmr002_372	That 's fine . ; um But I frankly didn't find it any more use to me than my hand - held taperecorder . ; Oh . ; I see .
Bns002_423	So ; if now two has uh mmm answer with the with the CTS , it will be waiting until the data that has to come . ; Yeah ? ; OK ,
Bro027_849	h he likes to use them both , ; cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative , ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_276	and , uh , so we need word transcripts and , uh , speaker change identification . ; So , speaker ID . ; And , uh so I 'd sort of like to know who 's going to do that , ; hi Jane ,
Bmr027_648	if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . ; Whereas , I I mean , I would be much more likely myself , ; And the other th ; given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever ,
Bro004_1201	Yeah ; So um . The temporal LDA does in fact include the same ; so that I think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way ; and then it 'd be OK .
Bed009_462	yep ; so this is really an ongoing discussion ; Mm - hmm ; yeah and um it might actually
Bmr022_692	There 's one file . ; That 's true , yeah . ; Yep . ; And then it will be , you know , this Eve - every now and then there 'll be a a beep missing .
Bmr024_1252	I just ; d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the ; So , most most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz . ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_138	Right . ; Yeah . ; I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . ; The roll call .
Bmr001_564	Right ? ; Although you know it claims they are . ; But probably the ; W I was just noticing on the on the there 's a view meter , software view meter and the PZM gain is real low .
Bed003_566	No , ; then it wouldn't be a demo ; I mean We can do a demo in the sense that we can um , just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . ; I was just gonna s
Bmr024_108	Someone can fill in Liz and Andreas later . ; OK . ; Uh ; So , we , uh we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit .
Bns002_492	That 's it . ; So when this node hears the CTS transmission that is performed by the receiver , this will be uh informed , that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it 's area . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_12	OK , ; did you solve speech recognition last week ? ; Almost . ; Alright !
Bns002_1165	were only one and two megabytes per second , ; but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh , the new eleven megabytes per second version ; I 've been use it for for a while , ; and it w can tell you it works pretty well .
Bro004_253	Uh . ; so No , that that 's important . ; So what what it 's saying here is just that ; " yes ,
Bed003_1527	Just kidding . ; So . ; It 'd help it figure it out . ; Right .
Bdb001_1301	Yeah . ; He he 's a language modeling person , though . ; Um ; So so imagine
Btr001_1904	Just curious . ; Yeah . ; Yeah yeah . Yeah . ; Nice guy .
Bmr011_250	Yeah . ; That 's OK . ; But ; but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform .
Bro010_1050	nasality . ; Now this was coming at it from a different angle ; but maybe it 's a good way to start . ; Uh , these are things which , uh , John felt that a a , uh a human annotator would be able to reliably mark .
Bmr012_917	OK . ; and so that was a standard for that sixteen s ; So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing . ; Right .
Bmr016_1526	cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used . ; How about question mark ? ; The question marks , yeah . ; Question mark is punctuation .
Bmr001_692	Right . ; Cuz . ; Well , I I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times , just for the novelty . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1118	And , I don't know ; But . ; I don't know eh uh i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . ; It would be interesting in itself to see .
Bed014_565	Now what could imagine to , you know , have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history , yeah ? ; That 's the really stupid way . ; Then there is the really clever way that was suggested by Keith ; and then there is the , uh , middle way that I 'm suggesting
Btr002_53	OK . So , um , I have an example ; OK . @ @ Not sure . ; Thank you . ; Oh , there 's Hold on .
Bro017_621	Like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_474	Should we be discussing this , ; OK . ; So th They , um , they gave They 've given us ; Since we started doing this new , uh , beep format with " beep number beep " ,
Bed016_192	readability ; Hmm ? ; There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . On page five . ; Interesting .
Bed017_96	And , um , ; So when you said " Andreas " I thought you were talking about Stolcke . ; Now I know that we aren't , ; OK .
Bro026_864	Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh so you stop at that point . ; And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_364	So . ; Uh . ; What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ? ; Well , they 're you know , they 're disputing it .
Bmr006_1077	so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; right ?
Bed012_843	How do you pronou ; OK . ; How do you pronounce your name ? ; Eva .
Bro027_698	Well , in the proposal , um , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think . ; Mm - hmm . ; Just ; Yeah , just the static , no delta .
Bro024_208	Could be . ; I don't know . ; And and th the third thing , um , uh , is , um , Barry explained LDA filtering to me yesterday . ; And so , um , Mike Shire in his thesis um , did a a series of experiments , um , training LDA filters in d on different conditions .
Bed016_543	So it 's the last paragraph ; before two . ; So on page two , ; um , the main focus
Bmr005_1282	And so it 's ; i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now ; Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , ; but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .
Bro023_1490	t Oh , this ; but possibly more . ; I mean , if channel one VAD gives you ; f
Bro007_238	Some sets have five hundred sentences , ; so . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Btr002_247	And how does it change the meaning ? ; What 's what are the two different meanings there ? ; It seems like because if I was just reading that thing , I would say , " So that would be a problem . So . " ; OK .
Bmr027_803	So so the only thing we 're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something . ; So , i this is gonna mean ; Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . ; Yeah .
Bed005_229	Except that we d w we don't have this , uh , time information here now , ; which is , ; um ; Oh . This are the reserve .
Btr001_2029	U no . ; Yeah , it 's difficult . ; Yeah , you guys talked about doing a videotape . ; Yes .
Bro026_965	Mm - hmm . ; So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , ; Right . ; So the question is , how far down ?
Bro027_467	OK . ; Which now is based on , uh , cleaned features . ; And , it 's a l it 's a lot better . ; Wow .
Bsr001_478	Well , yeah , I mean , that 's really like having one of these almost , ; I mean , that 's why That 's why if you if you use DragonDictate or or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these . ; so . ; Hmm .
Bmr014_71	Well , OK . ; No I 'm just ; I mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . ; And if they are , then they can't be used .
Bro014_591	That 's not clear , ; but this e ; Well , for the baseline . ; Yeah .
Bro026_503	Right . ; And maybe for VAD they would be OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1812	yeah . Sorry . ; Yeah , OK , good point . ; But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1421	Oh good . ; I mean I feel like it 's all quite normal . ; OK . ; Good .
Bmr022_973	you know . ; Not a I 'm not saying there 's not a far - field microphone , uh , application , ; but ; If we have a choi I 've always wondered how well they would work .
Bmr020_876	and and I understand that you guys were going to have a meeting today , before this meeting . ; It was just to talk about how to generate it . ; Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way . ; Excellent .
Bro014_1220	do you have the mean for the auto - correlation ? ; Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say " I don't care about the source " . ; For ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1587	So it 'd have to be sort of a causal , uh , version of @ @ . ; Oh , yeah . That 's OK . ; That that 's the sort of w we keep you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1777	Thank you . ; Yeah . ; Let 's see . Have you noti th one of the things that I found is is , um , surprisingly difficult these days is to co is to get certain electronic sounds , to try and describe them . ; Hmm .
Bdb001_1259	Um , ; so ; But , ; d isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye um , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they
Bmr010_1051	Right ? ; I mean , this was something that we were talking about . ; We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times . ; Right ?
Bmr006_1597	Uh I realize when you 're doing this that uh I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . ; Uh , and so , uh and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . ; So I think what would be helpful would be uh , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into into the agenda , ; OK .
Bdb001_1017	I 've used the P - file , I think . ; I 've looked at it at least , briefly , I think when we were doing s something . ; What does the P stand for anyway ? ; I have no idea .
Btr001_563	Oh , good to know . ; Yeah . ; Oh , there 's no question . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1826	Mm - hmm . ; You add it to the dictionary . ; which normally would be an acronym , ; you know , " TCL "
Bro004_1362	And it does have two processors , ; you know ; and Somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . ; And I mean i it 's possible that the
Bmr016_2287	The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial . ; Yeah . ; I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern . ; You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem .
Bmr026_1232	Let 's see . ; What am I trying to think of ? ; The The net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units ; and that 's the one that Eric trained up .
Buw001_298	and send them off to IBM ; and get a bunch of transcriptions ; even if they 're slightly flawed ; Yep .
Bro012_649	Maybe . ; Yeah . ; Nnn . ; Yeah . So , I mean , I I think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue
Bro027_1605	right . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So that delay , plus the LDA .
Btr001_479	yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; but I c I kn I think I know what she 's doing . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Buw001_1315	So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else ; Mmm . ; Right . ; rather than the
Bmr002_231	Yeah ? ; Yep . ; Um , ; OK .
Bed015_1645	There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . ; Uh , Mary Dalrymple , ; uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff . ; No , that 's horrible .
Bro005_474	But I don't know ; but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . ; Perhaps , yeah . ; Well , that 's that 's one thing ,
Bns003_115	Nee , because then the network is still running then . ; Could we wait until the network is running ? ; Because currently it 's not possible , uh , based on certain fire wall constraints . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_717	So but those are all easy things , ; It 's systematic , ; right ? ; yeah .
Bro021_126	But ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I I thought , Morgan , you brought it up a couple meetings ago .
Bed008_866	And sometimes um people say where is it ; Mm - hmm . ; because they wanna know where it is ; but in most cases they probably
Bro003_1797	So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , ; take a while to develop . ; Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . ; I mean , one I think one of the a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information .
Bro011_390	OK . ; Hmm ! ; There 's a bunch of data that l around , ; that people have done studies like that w way way back
Bmr024_708	But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , ; Yeah . ; but I don't think i it it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2195	And now , uh , thanks to the advances made in the interface , we can from now on use the channelized part , ; and , um , any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing . ; But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks ; Yeah , so that has implications for your script .
Bro011_53	I forget . ; So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . ; Well . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr025_125	Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows ; because it means porting the web server to Windows . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News
Bro028_752	OK . ; It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals . ; It 's a , um sort of came out of , uh uh , looking a lot like HTK . ; I mean , they started off with um , when they were building their system they were always comparing to HTK to make sure they were getting similar results .
Bmr005_663	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr024_706	It 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . ; It 's got a different purpose . ; But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_311	Yeah . ; Well , especially for normalizing . ; I mean , it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2199	uh . ; especially if you have a tool that can do this . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1750	Yeah . Of course . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , right . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1596	But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . ; It 's easy to unhook the external disks , ; put them back on the new machine , ; but then your slash - scratch is gone .
Bed014_1056	Uh . Would you like to ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I wo I would like I would sort of get a get a notion of what what you guys have in store for me . ; OK . I was actually gonna work on it for tomorrow like this this weekend .
Bmr015_850	And , um , if it 's voiced , ; I guess so so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too . ; But if it 's voiced , ; Yeah .
Bro007_517	Oh OK . ; I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , ; maybe .
Bro022_765	Mm - hmm . ; They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . ; So does any of this matter ? ; I mean , other than our interest in it .
Bmr031_1303	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's I guess it 's an undergrad , too , that that 's going to be doing this work . ; Cool .
Bro017_419	Uh well , he may be looking for a girl , for for I don't I don't I don't ask . ; I know that Naran - when last time Narayanan did that he came back engaged . ; Right . ; Well , I mean , I 've known other friends who they they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married ,
Bmr016_1887	Right . ; and you know I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling , ; Right . ; and it also gets kicked out in the , uh , freq frequency listing .
Bro024_1833	So what are these numbers here ? ; Are these with the clean or with the noisy ? ; This is with the clean . ; OK .
Bro019_400	No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used . ; No , no . ; With a different time constant . ; With the different time constant I found that
Bmr014_765	Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but that 's our decision then . ; Right ?
Bmr018_616	Those were the non - natives . ; And then there was another distinct bump at , like , a hundred , which must have been some problem . ; Oh , wow ! ; I can't imagine that
Bmr027_816	S I think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite . ; Yeah , release . ; And and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint . ; Yeah . It 's converging .
Bmr030_639	And we are sending them the compressed ones , ; right ? ; I don't know . ; Wha - whatever you generate .
Bed013_791	That 's th that 's definitely a good idea . ; That would be my , uh ; We we should sketch out the details maybe tomorrow afternoon - ish , if everyone is around . ; I don't know .
Bed006_1401	We will not end this discussion anytime soon . ; Yeah , ; I can guarantee that . ; And it 's gonna get more and more complex the the l complexer and larger our domains get .
Bro018_788	Uh . ; That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed017_618	Well , I didn't say anybody to anything to offend ; well , except for the sponsors maybe , ; but ; Right .
Bmr006_123	Because I think if you just say ; an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes You know . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus
Bmr027_308	and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Oh .
Bed002_100	um , it w uh , ; I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_859	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_228	Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at . ; I am too . ; And we did mention who " he " was . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_739	Yeah . ; Good . Good . ; I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News . ; So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think .
Btr001_777	So for the non - linguists , what 's a fricative ? ; I ; Ah . ; Oh .
Bed006_1702	It 's ; It 's an a attempt to refine it basically . ; And yeah , ; OK , great uh - huh .
Bro014_1265	yeah , ; it 's the excitation " . ; But it 's not really the excitation . ; It 's whatever it is that 's different between
Bro014_1268	It 's whatever it is that 's different between ; Oh . ; So so , stand standing back from that , you sort of say there 's this very detailed representation . ; This moved in the
Bmr019_1721	I d so I I jus ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I would like to to to say thank you very much , eh , to all people in the group and at ICSI , ; Oh .
Bro024_888	So ; If we look at the France Telecom proposal , they use some kind of noise addition . ; They have a random number generator , right ? ; And they add noise on the trajectory of , uh , the log energy only , right ?
Bro014_1072	Two thou two fifteen hundred ? ; Mm - hmm . ; No . ; Because
Bmr003_896	Uh , which is fine . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; It 's
Bmr026_568	I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , ; it 's no big deal . ; Uh , but the question is where they go , ; and I don't think we can solve that here ,
Bmr003_1483	And ; Yeah . ; but wouldn't say exactly when it happened . ; I 'll be right back .
Bro023_631	So ; but that 's not the case in , uh , many many of our cases ; but it works reasonably well . ; I see .
Bmr011_1770	the encoding of the ; Yeah . ; And and he also , he was ; The energy ,
Btr001_756	Mmm . ; I mean , like i it doesn't happen with , uh , like " buh " so much ; because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins . ; Although I found one in actually I was just working right before this meeting , one where someone said , " great "
Bro012_173	Mmm . ; So we 've put together all this ; and then we have results that are not um very impressive . ; Well , there is no real improvement .
Bmr023_393	You know , once in a while there 's something like , ; Yeah , sure . ; um , and e Actually you talked to them . ; Didn't you ?
Bmr008_1358	But it seems like energy energy tells you something , ; but uh if unless this is a normalization problem , it looks from your results like there 's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy - like , in addition to it , at least . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bsr001_2382	Yeah . ; No , but that that is beautiful ; Definitely should . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_703	Yeah , we had to get them to approve em ; Right OK . ; and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's ; but this this meeting that you have , no problem
Bro014_275	It depends what you wanna show . ; Mm - hmm . ; Each each one is gonna have a different characteristic . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_894	Oh , yeah . So that was that was , uh that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place . ; So that someone e until someone else fixed it , ; which is that , um , I never put ; when I u
Bmr029_120	Or or or was that only male ? ; Uh . Actually , I don't know . ; I 'd I I can look it up . ; It 's it 's it 's just ,
Bmr001_780	Yet . ; So that I mean , that 's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_305	It 's a different one . ; I see . ; The the , uh the tool from from Susanne . ; Oh , I see .
Bdb001_419	But other than that , are they compatible ? ; So , but ; I mean , you could sort of ; Yeah ,
Bmr002_1007	so um they have some sort of an arrangement . ; Well , I just wrote down the French site ; I see . ; and I will check it and try to download it
Bmr019_158	So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; A a a couple percent or some
Bmr022_1079	Right . ; And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues . ; That right now , lots of people create the files ; and then we have group " Meeting Recorder " .
Bmr025_177	That was a really good look . ; It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the ; You couldn't get a video . ; Guess who I practice on ?
Bmr002_715	I mean , some format that our tools already work with . ; Yeah . ; Well , ; Yes ,
Bro017_196	So . I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data . ; Oh ! ; I see . ; So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective ,
Bed015_1090	and ; cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure Th - th ; Yeah . ; which is fine .
Bed015_2084	but , uh , I don't know whether we should even start discussing . ; W what ; Yeah , sure , tell us what it is . ; Um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but hasn't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows .
Bmr014_520	Right . ; When ; for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ? ; It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses ,
Bmr012_376	there 's ; No those are actually ; Yeah . ; a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary ,
Bro018_137	Mmm . ; And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different . ; And something different in some fundamental way . ; And so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um something uh about the difference between the the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank .
Bmr013_623	And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then you have , all these things split across according to channel ,
Bed015_1085	Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there ; Yeah . ; but actually that 's a property of the situation . ; And it 's again , time , you know at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you
Bmr028_279	And if we have time , I 'll also add , you know , like , choosing which speakers you wanna include , and stuff . ; But ; OK . Well , I 'm gonna start working on this the week after next , ; so that 's the point when I 'll need to look more carefully at what y what what you guys have .
Bns003_694	OK . ; You you have to to pass the different tests ; and you have to study the different subjects . ; And , until you have finished with this , uh well OK , you can do it by by your own ,
Buw001_686	Big , big interest . ; Yeah . ; Huge . ; I mean , it personally , I don't I would never want to deal with it .
Bmr031_343	It it pretty good . ; Yeah . ; And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time ; for our transcribers to process things before and after ,
Bmr018_1307	Mm - hmm . ; I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for , ; but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed , ; Oh , that 's right .
Bmr007_1313	OK . ; But it has to be hand - labeled first ? ; but ; Uh , well , yeah .
Bed011_1003	No . ; No . ; No . ; Uh He 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now .
Bsr001_585	Yeah ? ; It was really a pain . ; Code ! ; Right .
Btr001_1211	uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves . ; Ho - ho how Have you ; Oh . ; And so I think you Yeah , I think you Did you
Bro017_530	So it 's like professor u university professor ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_16	Thirty - two . ; Yeah . Thirty . Whatever . ; So , uh , Morgan is , uh ; And the other condition is that they have to get a budget out , like , immediately ,
Bmr021_774	um ; Where should I start ? ; Uh the ; So there 's a two
Bro017_182	and so far not much uh success . ; Hmm . ; We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , ; instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model .
Bro027_1759	What ; what if you ; Uh . ; Right .
Bro003_1623	Yeah , so , one of the things that I need to I 've started looking at ; Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ? ; Sure . ; I 've started looking at , um , disk space .
Bmr005_1362	Right ? ; Yeah , but ; Well ; Yeah , who knows where they are .
Bmr026_1214	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_241	Yeah . ; Well in this case you have three . ; You have the silence , and that that 's fine . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1031	because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm
Bns002_1229	which is , I think , what , in the past , will power the ethernet uh revolution ; You can buy any any compatible product ; and and you know it will work with the other brand . ; Yeah .
Bro028_17	That 's good . ; Um , ; Yeah . Well , maybe we can start with this . ; Mmm .
Bro003_1964	Instead of the the the the superclass thing , ; which is to take ; So suppose y you don't really mark arti ; To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and and see where everything is ,
Bed013_52	and B , is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in August , to actually work . ; On ? ; With us . ; Oh .
Bns003_989	Yeah , ; that 's OK . ; Work packages . ; Sorry , sorry ,
Bed011_495	like at you know , " attend a theater , symphony or opera " is is a group , ; and " tour the university , castle or zoo " , ; mm - hmm Yeah . ; all of these d do have this kind of " tour " um aspect about the way you would go to them .
Bsr001_538	It 's wired . ; It 's funny , I li I kind of like this . ; So it actually gets most of its strength from from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear . ; Oh , this would drive me crazy .
Bmr027_793	Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , ; which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it . ; Because , you know , I have my stack of emails of to d to be done , ; Yeah .
Btr002_312	I th I think those are very good conventions . ; I also like w you know , this this whole point about how how that y th th the fact that you 're raising this , ; I li I like this example that , um , we have several things that are being cued by intonation , ; Right .
Bmr009_1207	Well , we ca Well , why can't we just say characterize something like char characterize your accent ; Well , Boston 's @ @ , too . ; Or ; " Characterize your accent if you can . "
Bns001_656	You can request certain kind of QS . ; You can even request it in GPS ; but it 's not end - to - end quality of service . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bmr005_981	And then there ; Uh , they do . ; or every ; w w And we talked to them about recording some more
Bro016_36	Cuz the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try , if you hadn't tried it before , because it hadn't occurred to me ; it was sort of an obvious thing ; is , um , adjusting the , uh , sca the scaling and , uh , insertion penalty sorta stuff . ; I did play with that , actually , a little bit .
Bro023_1476	I had twenty frames most of the time . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t
Bed006_1155	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; We o o
Bmr027_934	My , um I was thinking that with the NSA meetings , I 'd like there are three of them , ; and they 're uh , I I will have them done by Monday . ; Uh , unfortunately the time is later ; and I don't know how that 's gonna work out ,
Bmr010_247	We just have the the overlaps encoded in a simple bin . ; Well , OK . So @ @ the limits of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful . ; Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my my view ; and I think I mean , I had the sense that it was consensus ,
Bro012_788	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; There is just some filtering with the LDA ; and and some downsampling , upsampling .
Btr001_538	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; And that was really hard to deal with . ; we had lapels for d l brief
Bed004_413	So , um ; Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise . ; Well , here 's the problem . ; And and uh Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today
Bmr024_1171	Uh . ; Who 's that ? ; we have lots of them . ; Uh , I dunno .
Bmr014_543	Right . ; then cuz " neural nets " and oh she has some things that are oh " downsampled " , she got that right . ; Hmm . ; And some of these are rather uh unexpected .
Btr002_1030	Yeah , I do that all the time . ; Yeah . ; OK . So this is the difference between the PC keyboard and the SUN keyboard ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_925	What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is ; or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . ; But but , um , ; along the way how much should we , uh
Bed002_1027	Oh . ; No , not really . ; OK . ; Well , anyway . f Get one .
Bmr014_711	And then there 'll be a subset of people , ; right ? ; OK there 's ; I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .
Btr001_237	But ; I mean , I can I can pronounce it ; Huh . ; but I don't know any .
Bro018_287	Oh . So , this is trained on TIMIT . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , noisy TIMIT .
Bmr012_719	I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it ; hopefully it will be fairly quick ; but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on ; Alright
Bmr019_1913	OK . ; Oops . ; I have to what ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_1318	Um , maybe , ; yeah of course , ; um opera premiers . ; Really ?
Bmr019_200	I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; So , one so there were a number of things we noted from this .
Bro012_782	Hmm . ; oh , a plot of C - zero , ; So . ; the energy .
Bmr010_284	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . We could uh , potentially so . ; So . ; I also wanted to be sure
Bmr019_261	just run it on ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So , Morgan , you 're getting a little breath noise .
Bro011_303	Yeah . ; and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed010_824	So we gotta do all this . ; So there 's that . ; And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . ; So " OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . "
Bro017_36	There is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues . ; Like the voice activity detector , ; Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector . ; Right .
Bro004_221	Yeah . ; Sure . ; So if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test , ; Mmm .
Btr002_732	like , " Uh - oh . ; Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " , ; and I could tell because of the way it looks ! ; Yeah .
Bmr007_73	I didn't quite know what to make of that . ; Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr003_902	Right . ; Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate ; uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time , ; Oh !
Buw001_1000	Yeah . ; Or even just have one or two people stay behind . ; Ugh . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1294	I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in . ; Well , we thought about it . ; Ah , OK . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr013_81	There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . ; Good . ; Yeah . ; And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .
Bed005_628	The problem isn't the short ra range optimization . ; It 's the sort of o one or two year kind of thing . ; OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ? ; How how would we try to characterize those
Bro003_1535	It 's Nutmeg and Mustard , I think , ; Do you know these yet ? ; I don't know what kind . ; Nuh - uh .
Btr002_2687	Hmm . ; And ; I agree with you . ; Right .
Bmr024_1410	But then we had a slight difference in the in the scale . ; Uh , so . ; Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale . ; Uh - huh .
Bro022_1071	so ; Yeah . Just just to see whether it really it 's it 's is it worth trying or not . ; So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . ; So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also ,
Btr002_485	and I realize it 's not Jane , ; and I realize it 's not a female even , ; but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , I 'm supposed to transcribe it . " ; I 'm supposed to do it .
Bmr010_766	but not too far away . ; Yeah , i ; And then , you know , I think there 's not much ; Because you can't al you know , interfere w
Bmr029_954	but we 'll have to think about the the energy thing ; uh , what we wanna do . ; Right . ; This was a business about , uh , um , coming up with something that that was purely prosodic .
Bed010_643	" Origo " is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , ; that 's even used in the English literature . ; " Origo . " ; Oh , OK .
Btr001_200	you know , ; I I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can ; and I I just felt like you know , with the German accents , just for me personally , those were probably the toughest to get around . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_997	Oh , ; You 're you 're gonna tease me ? ; equipment . ; OK .
Bmr006_850	but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . ; Yeah , we just wanted to know what the category was here . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro004_391	cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet . ; Yeah . ; And comparing different bad results can be tricky . ; Hmm .
Bmr008_448	So . ; Um , and then the next are two sections ; One indented separately . ; So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers .
Bro012_307	Yeah , easily four times as many parameters . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think also just seeing what we saw uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ? ; when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ?
Bmr022_437	Mm - hmm . ; We could actually build the numbers into a template . ; Yep . ; Well .
Bmr007_30	OK . ; OK ; Testing , one , two , three . ; Um Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go ,
Btr002_1805	The the shift in ; The " doink " . ; Bling . ; Oh , that thing .
Bro027_352	Yeah . ; Um , ; OK . ; if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how
Bro010_1293	OK , ; yeah , ; I didn't notice this . ; I 'm sitting here
Bmr005_1071	Ciao . ; Uh so it 's it you have a a direct uh ; Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would ; um
Bmr002_1229	Yep . ; Do you think ; So , are are you familiar with this the MARS the MARSEC project ? ; uh - uh
Bsr001_1725	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; and , uh , ; uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better .
Bed002_1077	OK , and it turns out one called ; Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bed015_1887	OK . ; Just just sort of , you know , define your space . ; Yeah , OK . ; And , um , so th these are this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with .
Bro021_464	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; So do you have more , Stephane , ; or ?
Bro028_276	Well , that 's something I would like to investigate further , ; but , ; um , ; I did , like , um I did , uh , listen to the m most noisy utterances of the SpeechDat - Car Italian
Bmr022_1215	But , I mean , the meetings are gonna be the same way . ; but it 's different from the transcript . ; So UW records a meeting , ; we transcribe it .
Bmr001_467	I mean ; we 'd only use one of the PZM channels , ; something like this , ; and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels at once .
Bns002_1078	Something like this ; So you your packet should look like like this way . ; Do they have to ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2306	I can't think of any of the other ones . ; OK . ; Great . ; OK .
Bro012_1366	but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago ; and so it probably wasn't , actually ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_199	This seems to make sense because , well , uh we are this way avoiding all the routing problem ; that , well , we will talk a little bit uh , about routing later , ; but uh ; it it seems that i probably that the problem is is not an easy one ,
Bro023_1307	It 's the recursion , ; so it 's it 's the center recursion , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3425	That is really what that time field is . ; I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting , ; Oh , OK . ; but yes .
Bed004_648	Yeah , ; right , ; and then it would have values , uh , " Tour " , " Business " , or uh " Hurried " . ; Right .
Bmr011_247	Right . ; Now , this is locking the barn door after the horse was stolen . ; We do have thirty hours , of of speech , which is done this way . ; Yeah .
Bro023_799	So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ma
Bro022_577	and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . ; Oh . It 's like the tied state . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_76	Yeah , it 's ; and and OK , maybe it 's a little bit ; but i but it 's not not , um very , uh difficult or something like that . ; Uh - huh ,
Bmr031_1475	Um , and starting to , uh , r r take information from alignments ; and create a database that we can use sort of as a a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees , ; which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person 's frustrated or not . ; That reminds me of something .
Bed008_1333	Yeah . ; So step two is um ; right . ; So we 've assumed equal weights
Bed013_786	And people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit . ; Yeah . ; So this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the Bayes - net stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_236	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah that @ @ . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . So that that 's actually the definitely the way to do it .
Bmr010_213	So you have these twenty - four features . ; Yeah . ; Uh , a lot of them are spectral features . ; Is there a a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ?
Bmr013_743	Are the , um , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ? ; I mean , have you noticed any difference ? ; I 'm I 'm not sure , um , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , uh , I have have to loo have a look at them ; but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between ,
Bmr028_1193	We 're talking about which which version we 're using for evaluating the recognition . ; Which version of the transcripts . ; Right . They 're somewhere in between January and late March , or something like that ? ; Yeah . Something around there .
Bmr012_1346	Yeah . ; Um good . ; Thank you though , ; uh - huh .
Bed002_8	And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . ; So , which is my bar ? ; Mah ! ; Number one .
Bed016_506	I 'll probably I c might have I 'll probably have comments for you separately , ; not important . ; Anyway . ; Oh , in the presentation here .
Bmr008_29	uh and then uh Jose as usual uh , the one among us who 's actually doing a bunch of things on this ; uh He has this and I think we can have some ; I was just glancing through it , so I think we have something to discuss about . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_644	Uh - huh . ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; He did a system uh , in
Bro007_207	the one I was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one . ; Mm - hmm ? ; Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size reduced dimensionality . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_449	but we 'll definitely take it up if you ; I th ; I think you 're right . ; I think it 's about four or five gig
Bmr006_1407	Ye - Pretty much . Yeah . ; Very complex , uh Yeah . ; It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1643	No , ; I think the idea is to train on the , uh on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we 're gonna train to , ; Right . ; OK .
Bro005_848	So . Um . ; Yeah . ; Do you think the alignments are bad ? ; I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ?
Btr001_489	cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . ; I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German .
Bro027_1030	Mm - hmm . ; What 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? ; Oh , ; I know what I was gonna say .
Bro004_1339	uh IBM was donating five , ; I think we only got two so far , ; processors . ; We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors .
Bed013_678	Yeah , that 's what it means . ; Hhh ! ; OK , cool . ; Huh .
Bro012_476	Uh . ; Ninety - three point six four , ; right ? ; is the baseline .
Bmr027_1046	but it really " web master " . ; Oh . Uh - oh . ; And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that . ; So instead of " split upon unknown " , it 's " split in principle " .
Bmr014_523	It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , ; cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . ; Oh . ; So they tried to approximate it , but it was
Bmr006_1612	I mean , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? ; How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? ; How do you mean ? ; I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so " ,
Bed009_806	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And yes the it the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that um Mark Light originally w worked on in while he was in Tuebingen ; and then somebody else in Tuebingen picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen ,
Bro010_199	So . ; Well . ; Yeah , ; so they were basically
Bmr008_1388	un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten , ; Yeah . ; but ; Yeah .
Bed002_775	Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do ; and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr026_1219	Right , because you used the context windows ; and so the input to hidden is much , much larger . ; Yeah . ; Oh I see ,
Bro003_1308	Uh - huh . ; So . ; Broader class ? ; Um , the broader broader training corpus nets
Bmr012_1084	Could make our own handbands and ; Um , and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA ; and so it will take about a week to get here . ; Yeah well it 's
Bmr027_390	That 's right . ; Right ? ; So ; You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .
Bmr019_28	I guess the other thing , which I came unprepared for , uh , is , uh , to dis s s see if there 's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting . ; Right . ; So . ; Any I mean , maybe not .
Bed015_943	go ahead , ; finish . ; and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . ; But it 's still is limited possibility .
Bed006_216	You can send it to me . ; if ; OK . ; yeah .
Bro021_112	Uh , well , this doesn't help neither , ; but this doesn't hurt . ; So , well . ; It seems pretty
Bed015_984	on like focus , right ? ; Um , topic it seems kind of you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Japanese has this though .
Bro019_549	What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra . ; The speech .
Bed003_406	Is that the deal ? ; That 's how we have it currently set up , ; Yeah . ; but it could be , you know , based upon hour
Bmr022_140	We can definitely do that . ; So t so one question is , are there good places in the files where we can really do that ? ; Well , the other thing You can ; I mean , so so so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them .
Buw001_1856	What is it ? ; We don't know . ; Oh , OK . ; " Recording equipment . "
Bmr022_330	I i t i s ; makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward . ; And so they can hear something , then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again . ; And so they 're
Bed005_899	Anyway . ; S ; Who 's going ? ; So , uh So , uh , I was just going to ask ,
Bmr020_1234	Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , the tra They focus on the dominant speaker ; Mm - hmm . ; They just do that on the main channels . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1638	OK . ; It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand . ; Yeah , three . ; Right .
Buw001_1581	OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . yeah .
Bro027_25	So . ; Um . ; Yeah , it 's it 's interesting . ; I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation ,
Bmr027_874	It 's very nice . ; Yeah . ; I I like the high - tech aspect of it , ; No , no , no . I actually don't .
Bmr013_1000	we won't , uh , at least try them out . ; So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? ; Yep . Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1905	Yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that could be sizeable right there . ; And this is everything .
Bmr015_563	that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth ; and keep it consistent . ; Um , ; and then , uh , the microphone issues .
Bmr010_1002	Yeah . ; so what what should I do with that ? " ; Yeah . ; And I said , " well for our purposes ,
Bmr010_306	I see . ; The the , uh the tool from from Susanne . ; Oh , I see . ; OK . OK . Alright .
Bmr013_229	So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . ; Yeah . ; And , depends what you 're interested in . ; See , I don't know .
Bed009_40	Uh - huh . Nice to meet you . ; Hi . ; Hi . ; OK .
Bro005_1451	uh ; I think I won't touch anything ; cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash ; which it seems to do , pretty easily .
Bed005_929	Got it . ; Is that ; OK . ; And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing ,
Bmr003_1288	What Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p ; So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . ; He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . ; OK .
Bro010_947	Mm - hmm . ; So , um , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . ; We trained these things up on the on the , uh the final label . ; Now we have I guess done experiments
Bmr027_1324	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; no big deal " . ; A hundred gig here ,
Bmr026_293	Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's ; Right , right . ; I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something . ; You know , wh
Bro012_33	And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that , ; so . ; Yeah . ; A simple thing to do is
Btr002_700	They were painful . ; Exa - I agree . ; Uh ; And that 's that 's th you know , I would watch the visual sis signal to avoid that .
Bdb001_1358	But it could be that they just uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff , ; Right , ; exactly . ; So it could get very , very ugly .
Bmr028_793	Th - t I 'm just ignorant about the sof software architecture of this thing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . So , if if you ; Right . Quicknet is a very nice stream - based library ,
Bed005_1174	Yeah , so there 's there 's two separate things , Robert . ; The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , " if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . " ; OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at . ; So , if you don't have any information about the discourse , you just use your priors of of whatever eh the discourse
Bro022_404	Yeah . ; I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually ; so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits ; and it 's a little bit better than the previous system .
Buw001_1320	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . ; So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now
Bmr013_218	Yeah . ; Yeah that 's I I agree . ; That it 's just ; Sort of less predictability ,
Bmr030_283	And Yeah . ; I mean , so , there 's obviously a trade - off between the number of knots y you pick , and the best fit . ; I mean , so , if you 're doing a piece - wise linear , you have to figure out how many pieces you want . ; Yeah .
Bed016_565	so that all of the projections of it also should work . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1238	Done ? ; Kind of done . ; Actually , I was gonna ; Di - Did you have anything n that 's going on , or
Bro024_1565	But for Finnish , you have a degradation already when you go from thirty - five to thirty ; and then from thirty to twenty - five . ; And I have the feeling that maybe it 's because just Finnish has a mean energy that 's lower than than the other databases . ; And due to this the thresholds should be
Bmr007_457	In fact and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing . ; Right . ; And that 's interesting . ; Right .
Bro019_440	Yeah . ; But but it might be uh In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , you know . It 's it 's still someth reasonable .
Bmr006_447	Mmm . Of the meeting ? ; but maybe yeah , maybe you 're ; If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like ; right . Right . Right .
Bed006_668	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; we have a whole library of schemas . ; And they 're gonna be , you know , fleshed out in in their real ugly detail ,
Bro026_635	So , yeah , so ; after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . ; It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me . ; But , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while .
Bed011_99	OK . ; The release form is over there in that box . ; Alright , fair enough . ; And um And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here .
Bmr028_1325	but it would seem @ @ ; Now , I have to I have to I really need to , uh , raise a question about the term " cheating " . ; OK ? ; And the reason is , um , if I understand that , " cheating " is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics does , and what what my transcribers are doing and what I do , which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data .
Bro021_950	No ? ; No ? ; Oh , maybe it 's I am ; I 'm problem .
Bmr003_1090	Yeah , they won't . ; They won't . ; They w they 'll refuse to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1221	With lapel mikes or something ? ; Well , they probably already use lapel , ; but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant . ; Right .
Bro024_482	Um , ; so the last week , uh , I showed some results with only SpeechDat - Car ; which was like some fifty - six percent . ; And , uh , I didn't h
Bro013_604	and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . ; Yeah . ; It 's around one hundred , one hundred and fifty hertz Nnn . ; Right .
Bmr003_2163	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Uh . ; Dot , dot , dot .
Bed013_929	It 's ; Discourse . ; Oh , discourse . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_857	You know , this front - end u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , how many filter banks do you use , ; what what bandwidth do you use , and stuff like that .
Bmr024_1591	Um . ; Alright . ; So ; Uh , they 're having tea out there .
Bro023_781	OK . ; So , that that was just the , uh , reason for doing that experiment . ; And , w um ; Yeah , but this all these things , I have to still try it on the TI - digits ,
Bro024_120	Alright , the e uh , I see your point . ; I guess I was thinking of it as , um , an interesting research problem . ; Yeah . ; The how to g I was thinking that for the ASRU paper we could have a section saying , " For SmartKom , we we d in we tried this approach in , uh , interactive system " , which I don't think has been done before .
Bro018_1075	Uh . ; Yeah . ; Trying to track it down . ; Yeah .
Bed014_520	But , you know , c um almost certainly " can you pass the salt " is a construction worth noting that there is this th this this this uh ; Yeah . ; Request . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bro003_114	Yeah . ; OK . ; And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1654	So , uh , w h he kind of did he started off with what was in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do , ; although hardly anybody had done it yet . ; And , uh , it it does work very well under some conditions ; and other conditions it doesn't .
Bro027_1151	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of S N Rs than that was originally there in the training set . Of TIMIT . ; Because in the TIMIT it was zero to some clean . ; Right .
Bmr006_1311	Yeah . ; Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . ; Yes . ; Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either .
Bro028_380	Yeah . ; OK . ; I mean We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges ; because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition .
Bmr005_575	But I have to study with more detail . ; But eh my idea is to to process only nnn , this eh nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . ; Because I think it 's more realistic . ; I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh
Bed015_1142	semantically . ; So ; So it uh , uh , a table . ; You know , a thing that c doesn't have a gender .
Bro013_578	Oh , yeah . ; they say that yesterday they are some problem ; But ; Yeah , but it 's not
Btr002_3434	So we have to ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bsr001_1810	Mmm . ; And so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr006_775	Yeah . ; I 've gotta ask you . So , uh , the difference between the top two , i ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; So so I start at the bottom , so " silence " is clear .
Bmr022_709	so . ; Yeah , it 's there . ; Mm - hmm . ; I haven't looked at these ,
Bmr015_1155	So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . ; That sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise . ; Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , ; as I really try to not to detect those breaths
Bro016_464	Yeah , yeah . ; We have , yeah , extracted actually the noises from the SpeechDat - Car . ; And so , ; we can train neural network with speech and these noises .
Bmr010_1560	and it worked pretty well , ; but I haven't worked with it a lot . ; So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample ; Nnn , yeah .
Bmr006_1344	But ; Yeah . ; Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1041	Right . ; Right . ; And then how do you go from there to the ? ; This is right .
Btr002_1019	It 's just th right above the backspace . ; Um , yeah , it 's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to . ; Th ; Yeah .
Bed015_1160	So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ? ; Sure . ; Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . ; And just a note ,
Bed017_747	So , ; enormous problem in California , ; and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . ; We think we could .
Bmr024_279	Uh , lemme say that my , ; uh ; So , um ; At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time .
Bdb001_183	cuz th it does get very bush with ; I I am imagining you 'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want . ; You ; Right .
Bro012_521	Yeah that 's th ; Yeah . ; I mean , especially when they 're this small . ; I mean .
Bro014_1162	I 'm sorry . ; So , you know , all ; But ; Yeah .
Bmr028_773	But the r the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the ICSI tools . ; And so , ; that 's what I 'm doing now . ; And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate the P - files I need .
Bmr014_121	Maybe . ; Yeah . ; Weirder things have happened . ; I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics ,
Bed015_740	" Stress " ; I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . ; So , um , like " stress " , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1894	I I think they don't have any implications for anything else ; so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now ; an and It 's easy enough to find them when they 're in curly brackets . ; We can always get an exhaustive listing of these things and find them and change them .
Bmr016_604	um ; but as we I mean I wanted to here more about the transcription . ; If we can get the channel asynchronous or the ; Yeah .
Bed008_770	Yeah . ; Well what about the Grand Canyon , ; right ? ; No , never mind .
Bmr020_556	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But he yeah , he 's he 's right , ; y I mean maybe
Bed014_1220	Mmm . ; Right . Let 's put a Skolem Skolem constant in , ; Yeah . ; shko
Bmr012_421	Oh it 's the ; Yeah . ; the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error ; yeah
Bed015_1424	and a in a possible inference is " in contrast to other things " . ; Yeah . ; So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , " in France such - and - such happens " . ; Yeah .
Bro024_235	uh that 's that 's why that 's why RASTA filter has actually ended up lasting a long time , ; people still using it quite a bit , because y you don't change it . ; So ; doesn't get any worse .
Bmr008_821	Native - speaking New Yorkers , as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their You know . ; Oh yeah . ; mm - hmm ; There are lots of things that are very identifiable as um you know , other other aspects , which is why we have this third category .
Bed003_243	good . ; So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , ; because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th ; Want to do Vista ,
Bro007_230	About ? ; and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least . ; Ye ; But words well word I don't know .
Bmr028_865	And ; Right . Right . ; and and , again , if you rule out the overlap , you have some numbers for that , ; cuz that 's yet another
Bro023_509	OK . ; And so that that 's that 's what the difference is . ; And actually I tried it on s the original clean I mean , the original spectrum where , like , I the second time I estimate the filter but actually clean up the noisy speech rather the c s first output of the first stage ; and that doesn't seems to be a giving , I mean , that much improvement .
Bmr027_924	batch - wise ; What I was thinking ; Uh , so this one ; That was exactly right ,
Bmr028_1019	But if you only had your PDA sitting in front of you ; Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much . ; And you have more than one mike . ; Yeah . If you don't have one more than one mike , you don't have a very good handle on location .
Bmr014_374	Yeah , yeah . ; I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . ; OK . ; OK , and the transcribers h
Bmr023_381	OK . ; The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . ; Now there was , uh , I g guess ; So , a couple weeks ago I needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation
Bed003_884	Oh actually it 's it it wouldn't affect any of our nodes , ; right ? ; What I was thinking was if you had a like ; Oh it 's it affects th The " doing business " is certainly not .
Bro012_448	Do you remember that Signif program that we used to use for testing signi ? ; Is that still valid ? ; I I 've been using that . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_551	Yes , ; yeah . ; Right , right . ; So we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level .
Bmr005_553	I I I think eh ; I saw the nnn the eh ; but eh I eh I have eh any results . ; I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike ,
Bdb001_1357	Yeah , exactly . ; But it could be that they just uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff , ; Right , ; exactly .
Bmr018_1396	Yeah . ; like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ? ; That 's what I did . ; Yeah ,
Bro005_514	Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1259	Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch ; It um ; Uh , we should count out ; how many more digits to forms do we have back there ?
Buw001_1994	Mm - hmm . ; But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over ; and and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW . ; So , I think that that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .
Bmr002_516	I mean there 's We 're we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost ; cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established . ; And so that 's just whatever it is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_544	So these are these are ; S ; So these are these are your friends back at EML . ; Yep .
Bmr020_790	I 'll make another directory . ; Yeah . ; You don't n m ; Exactly .
Btr001_1348	Yeah . ; Oh . ; And I had to sorta break them down . ; Oh .
Bro023_551	That 's that 's just a rule ; and we 'd you you were permitted to do that . ; Is is that it ? ; Uh , I think they will send , um , files
Bed009_504	OK , ; so that ; uh , ; for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do .
Bsr001_1573	Oh , right . ; So so , I One question . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_164	No , no , we definitely would not have the user fill it out . ; Good , OK . ; It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is . ; Perfect .
Bmr019_60	But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something . ; No , actually I I have to I have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places . ; Right ? ; I see . OK .
Bmr028_1334	OK . I mean , that that part is OK . ; But I but I do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that 's a little bit less evaluative , like , um , " hand - marked " . ; Uh , but cheating is is p ; Sure . But chea but cheating is is is pretty commonly used to mean this .
Bmr028_795	Yeah . So , if if you ; Right . Quicknet is a very nice stream - based library , ; Uh - huh . ; so without too much effort , once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools .
Bro016_818	Yes . ; So they 're kinda like log probabilities is what I was saying . ; And those ; OK .
Bro012_203	So then if you take your changes ; It 's similar for other test sets ; and then ; but I mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also .
Bed011_173	if it is you know charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e ; whatever . ; Twenty - two million to fly to International Space Station , you know . ; Right .
Bmr012_1139	Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up ; and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to ; A hand - held , ; yeah .
Bed011_398	Take care of him . ; OK . ; so s ; Alright .
Bed010_1037	Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And you 'll get feedback from these guys .
Bmr003_1756	Hopefully not very much . ; Yeah , I didn't use it very often . ; Especially for meetings . ; It l ou
Bro024_1335	Yeah , yeah . ; That 's true . ; So the alignments from the different database that are used for training came from different system . ; Syste
Bmr006_1798	Yeah . But I I also wanna say that people ; I see . ; And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr016_1628	S s six now , yeah . ; Now it 's at least six times , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Six .
Bro011_161	and they told us " well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network " ; but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and ; Then they couldn't . ; I see .
Bmr005_1139	So for those kind of reasons , ; and also a a c a complete inversion , ; if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . ; Um , that 's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,
Bro024_558	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; right ? ; So that 's not as good as the one up above . ; No .
Bro016_948	Um , i it would be good for me to talk to Hynek , I think , when he 's here . ; Yeah . ; Do you know what his schedule will be like ? ; Uh , he 'll be around for three days .
Bmr011_1408	So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , " well " , and that " well " is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag . ; Uh , and things like that , ; um , ; Of course some of that can be li done lexically .
Btr001_1249	that 's right too . ; Yep . ; Oh , OK , ; yeah , then I 'm doing that right now .
Bmr007_95	And , uh you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to sixty seconds . ; OK . ; And , um What you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right , whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers . ; And , um and , what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're bursts of them .
Bro026_126	well , I I 've been I 've been train training a new VAD and a new feature net . ; OK . ; So they should be ready . ; Um .
Bmr006_263	Right . ; Uh . ; But . Um , and ; Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS .
Bed013_408	Right . ; It 's on , ; just just put it on . ; I 'm
Bmr011_832	Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? ; I don't remember the acronym . ; The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . ; And that 's basically what I based the format that I did
Bmr024_910	I I don't know many people who do it on CD . ; I mean , they 're the most fo ; LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1820	um , m backchannels or whatever . ; And some people ; I mean ; I remember transcribing one person ,
Bmr009_907	Sorry about that . ; So on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_30	Yeah . ; Yeah , it is at the moment . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bed004_832	there 's Let 's say there 's a uh cont ; there the the land the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container . ; OK . ; So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information .
Bmr026_518	I mean does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and ; Yep . ; So I was assuming he was gonna take over that . ; But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .
Bro023_1176	That 's the musical noise ? ; Which is musical noise , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah ,
Bmr003_882	So you do the whole thing three times ; and then we get ; Yeah . ; No .
Bmr006_334	You can ; use Um , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , ; but I mean ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_228	Information related to the user and information related to the situation . ; And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that ; what we can get from the utterance . ; That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently
Btr002_815	That 's not I wouldn't I mean ; But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ? ; Just to jump it back . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_558	But , um , ; I also think that a again once we got into it , that , um , using some kind of clustering would probably work reasonably well there , too . ; Certainly for the the two microphone case , ; which we 're not gonna mess with because it 's another whole deal with the low - quality microphones ,
Bmr016_1598	understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said " OK . " ; You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , ; but just n needs to be double checked . ; There 's a lot of " OK 's " .
Bro013_269	Mm - hmm . ; So . Yes . ; But ; It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder .
Bmr012_252	yeah . ; Cuz it 's it 's it 's h it 's it 's very small ; so does this glitch occur at other ; There there there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized
Bed017_190	And that would basically it 's just another class in the model , ; with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . ; And then , after you group them together this ; no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .
Bed005_138	Well , if you , eh ; We 'll show you . ; Yeah , we can show us , ; or are we gonna see that ?
Bro003_1685	Like a s like a slide ? ; Uh , ; so w we can say what we 're doing , ; yeah .
Bro012_1296	It could be pretty small . ; Yeah . If you have a tandem system ; and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_590	and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti ; so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power ; and um ; we 'd have to schedule it
Bro003_1897	Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this . ; Um . ; Right ? ; I mean , if if in fact that is a better thing to do , should we leverage that , rather than doing , um , our own .
Bed005_744	because the reference problem really is not trivial , even if you have such a g well - defined world . ; He knows . ; Ah - he you are not , uh , throwing uh , uh , carrying owls to Athens . ; Could you give me an example of a reference problem ?
Bro021_1333	And you look you take all o all of the nonspeech components in an utterance , ; so you have a fair amount . ; Do you benefit from having a better model for the noise ? ; That would be another question .
Bed008_42	and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . ; Well I think one could go there 's ; I think we can di discuss everything . ; First of all this I added , I knew from sort of basically this has to be there
Bmr012_553	And I have to try it on the far field mike ; but ; yeah . ; PZM
Bro013_30	mostly not digits , of course , ; but but then again ; Well , yeah . ; In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M
Bdb001_92	And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag ; which has " start equals T - seventeen , ; end equals T - eighteen " . ; So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time .
Btr001_540	And that was really hard to deal with . ; we had lapels for d l brief ; And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks , ; Hmm .
Bro018_106	Yeah . ; But um ; It 's not quite better . ; Right , but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what
Bro024_877	Yeah . ; So . ; I mean , we we could trit uh , we we could think how w what what we could try . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1017	Mm - hmm . ; It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved ; because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . ; Yeah .
Bro005_486	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . ; Yeah . ; So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh on say digits ,
Bmr008_1712	Good . ; sorry . ; Yeah . ; What what happened with the different contexts
Bmr009_434	and I would imagine there should be some you know , there should be The distributions should be somewhat separated . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh and I I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some there 's there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it .
Bmr006_714	Duration . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh , um , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone . ; I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech .
Bed003_1426	" What do you need need to buy a ticket ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; You know ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_291	I 'll ask Eva about the E Bayes and she 's working on that . ; How is the generation XML thing ? ; I 'm gonna work on that today and tomorrow . ; OK . No need to do it today or tomorrow even .
Bro004_1100	although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . ; Well , it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill minus thirteen . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it says what it is .
Bed015_2111	So you get whatever comes from discourse ; but also filtered . ; Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_242	Well in this case you have three . ; You have the silence , and that that 's fine . ; Yeah . ; So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever ,
Bmr005_514	So . ; I mean the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech ; Mm - hmm . ; The the the far - field ,
Bro028_67	Um . ; Was Hari on the on the phone ? ; Yeah , sure . ; OK .
Btr002_720	Yeah . ; Especially if they also got louder too , and they hit it , ; Y y yeah . ; Oh !
Bro022_1125	How about you , Carmen ? ; Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . ; And , one of the things that last week , ; eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff
Bro025_211	Mm - hmm . ; uh , that that have some of the noise removed . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features .
Bmr028_61	Actually th he did a SRT file for it . ; Mm - hmm . OK . ; And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format . ; Oh , good . That 's very good . OK .
Bro014_1021	and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad . ; Uh , so it would s ; and and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral , uh a s a smooth spectral envelope , ; so there must be something else that you get in return for that
Bro005_381	Yeah . ; I wonder why ; Yeah . Uh . ; Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled ,
Bmr022_1159	You know , it 's it 's , um . ; Well , so , you don't have to release it to the world until you 're ready to . ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bro007_72	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_670	Right . ; Could we Could we , um ; we have have in the past and I think continue will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr003_2609	Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer . ; Well , actually shorten ; Yeah . ; There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this ,
Bed015_96	Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . ; So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , ; often a human . ; Right ?
Bmr024_1553	Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors . ; A few more processors ? ; How many are you shooting for ? ; There 're five now .
Bed010_521	So , ; um , now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction ; he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , " your bike is parked across the street " ; and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , " well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike " ,
Bmr012_1404	Welcome . ; Then you then you go back to Norway , ; that 's ; Yeah .
Bro005_722	uh , much as I said with JRASTA , ; even though I really like JRASTA ; and I really like MSG , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1552	That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it . ; That was it , huh ? ; OK . ; OK .
Bro023_258	the argument , um , against multiple passes was u u has often been " but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response " . ; And the counterargument to that which , say , uh , BBN I think had , was " yeah , ; but our second responses are second , uh , passes and third passes are really , really fast " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_826	So this is sort of came as a surprise to me that you know , embassy s is featuring a nice parser ; but it 's what I hear . One could also look at that and see whether there is some synergy possible . ; Mm - hmm , yeah , ; it would be very interesting ,
Bro027_1603	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , plus the delta , ; right . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1126	And , uh and then also a lot of the fancy user - interface stuff that 's in Transcriber I haven't done . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it works . ; What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ?
Bed012_311	No , I can I can do the Timing node in here , too , ; and say " OK . " ; Well , yeah , but in the s uh , let 's just deal with the s the simple case of we 're not worrying about timing or anything . ; We just want to know how we should answer " Where is X ? "
Bns002_940	Oh , sorry ! ; But even if you if you don't have to to worry about eh your power source , you have to worry about your environment , ; about not using more resources that you don't own ; Yeah .
Btr002_2767	Yeah . I 've seen a few of them , ; Hmm . ; So yeah , you 've s they slip through . ; Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice .
Bmr015_1024	n the first one that I did for i for this , ; Yeah . ; where truly w we 're hearing you breathing like as if we 're you 're in our ear , ; you know , and it 's like it 's like
Bsr001_1321	and it 's all of these things i i is a g ; it uh there are very ; " Computer , show me a web page on X , " return . ; Yeah .
Bns002_449	All the packets , ; all unicast packets . ; but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_412	And ; Or who talks the loudest . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_410	I mean , we were talking about that . ; It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise , ; um , and , uh , ; Cuz that happens before the mel conversion ,
Bmr031_1320	Oh ! ; so , uh , they 'll I sent them our recognition output ; so they can sort of do a line - by - line comparison ; and see if if they , um you know , their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that .
Bed010_1123	so . ; Yeah , I I Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret . ; OK . ; Hi
Bmr022_552	You know , Liz , all we would re ; It would take a little work , ; but not any real human not a lot of human work . ; Right . I mean , that 's what we want to avoid .
Bro004_725	So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , ; No , ; or ? ; I we plan to start this
Bmr021_562	I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out , ; so I assume that 's alright with everyone . ; I actually haven't looked at it yet . I haven't had a chance , ; I haven't either .
Btr001_2030	Yeah , it 's difficult . ; Yeah , you guys talked about doing a videotape . ; Yes . ; um , it 's mainly a matter of two things .
Bmr009_595	Yeah . ; Yep . ; That 'd be really great . ; OK .
Bns001_648	Yeah ; b le let me let me ask you a question about eh UMTS or or third or possible fourth generation communic wireless communication systems . ; that ; Yeah .
Buw001_162	No . No . ; I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel ; And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z ; Let me , uh , turn that off .
Bro016_1180	And like I say , I I encourage you to go ahead and meet , uh , next week with , uh , uh , Hynek . ; Alright , ; I 'll I 'll start . ; It 's , uh , one thirty - five .
Bro028_803	Did you see that one ? ; Um , it was a poster . ; Or ; Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper .
Bmr018_977	but ; uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , ; so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop ; and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases ,
Bmr022_196	seven or something ? ; Or ; What is it ? ; So I think uh , Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked ,
Bmr029_384	It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , ; I 'm I 'm kind of questioning that .
Bro010_273	Right . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And there 's physical inertia there ,
Bmr014_37	Oh really . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; " Spikes " , you mean like uh , instantaneous click type spikes , or ?
Bed006_658	Yeah this is not an XML ; OK . ; this is sort of towards an a schema , ; nuh ?
Bro013_509	Yeah , it is the height is voiced portion . ; The p the peaks should be voiced portion . ; And this is the noise portion . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr016_1084	Yep . ; So . ; Each partition . ; And you wanna use , either XA or scratch .
Bro007_218	For many a mismatch it 's worse . ; but ; Yeah . ; But it is little .
Bro019_1400	what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . ; And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I how do I get labels ? ; Training data for for these acoustic events . ; And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the the models themselves ,
Bed015_1103	Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's unclear whether ; I mean , you could just have in your scenario , " here are some extra few things that are true " , right ?
Bmr024_1580	OK . ; OK . ; Is is Liz coming back , do you know , ; or ?
Bro014_752	Yeah . ; And so ; So it 's better than the system that we had before . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1782	Thank you . ; Right . ; And , thank you very much . ; Have a good trip .
Btr001_518	Mm - hmm . ; That too . ; Yeah . ; Or just
Bmr009_891	What which form are you talking about ? ; Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one . ; This is the digit form . ; Oh .
Bmr002_825	Because he 's saying if you represent ; I don't think so . ; He says that uh in German " selbst " is used in two different ways ; so you have It either means uh " himself " or it means " even "
Bns002_219	So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one . ; or at least it has the drawbacks um , um , I was telling you . ; Eh , let 's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks , ; Uh , you know , the easiest eh way to to show how this works is or at least one of I think one of the easiest is that this drawing , or this picture ,
Bmr028_764	Uh ; What what was on his queue for recognition experiments ? ; OK . ; Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff .
Bmr020_1480	Yeah . ; Yeah , cuz @ @ uh what I had originally said to Brian was well they 'll have to mark , when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background , ; because I thought that was gonna be the most prevalent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1752	Yeah , right . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , Hans - Guenter will be here next week
Btr001_1476	Because i it 's just i n ; Right . ; So what they get is like i t is they get something like " beep one " . ; And then then they get " beep two " , " beep three " .
Bmr008_1342	an alteration in th in the tracking way . ; Excuse me ? ; You mean that eh you ehm mmm ; I understand that eh you you mean eh to to study the alteration between the the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone .
Bro016_538	it 's probably something that , mmm , the you know , the , uh , experiment designers didn't really think about , ; because I think most people aren't doing trained systems , or , you know , uh , systems that are like ours , where you actually use the data to build models . ; I mean , they just doing signal - processing . ; Yeah .
Bed012_729	Yeah . ; OK , then . Let 's meet meet again next Tuesday . ; And , um , finish up this Bayes - net . ; And once we have finished it , I guess we can , um
Bro004_686	Actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . ; And using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr026_85	I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I maybe I 'll ; Yeah , well it certainly seems ; Uh if if that 's OK with you to to , you know , get that stuff uh to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1005	There is actually a text file that you can edit . ; But it 's ; You don't have to do that . ; There 's like an XML format for Bayes - nets .
Bmr029_352	Uh , I think that 's the o actually ; and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone . ; And overlap or not . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1039	Yeah . ; I agree . ; We were always gonna run them past somebody . ; So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments .
Bmr013_51	Right . ; And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . ; And inc increase it by one or two percent , yeah . ; Yeah , Yeah .
Buw001_873	Yeah . ; Well ; Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be ; I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking ,
Bro016_319	or determine that it is true , ; in which case we want to adjust that ; and then continue with with what we 're doing . ; Right .
Bro011_167	So , yeah . ; Now we will try to ; Just talk more . ; Yeah , slikes and send mails .
Bro003_1806	Um . ; So , uh . ; So I think ; Yeah .
Bro018_1037	Yeah . ; So . ; But I mean you could uh if if if that looks promising you could , you know , r uh run the overall test set with a with a few different uh pruning thresholds for both , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1199	or there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . ; And so there are more insertions ; but most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one . ; And so I 'm just in in progress of , yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data
Bmr013_1050	Yeah ? ; Just start saying " M four " . ; Yeah , OK . ; Yeah .
Bro012_931	Uh ; OK . ; but does this have the voice activity detection in it ? ; Yeah .
Bed014_1298	you know , like maybe a lot of people would have m much stronger reactions , ; so , you know , he 's like a relatively friendly linguist ; Yeah . ; and yet a word like " constraint " causes a lot of problems .
Bmr023_1203	Yeah . That makes sense . ; Yeah . ; And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ? ; As you should never do worse .
Bmr011_1654	if you know any groups that are m you know , ; Well I had asked some some of the students at the business school . ; Yeah . ; I know
Btr002_499	And the pre - segmenter doesn't give them any or the information eith either . ; I 'm I 'm sure that it 's because of the ; Yeah . ; Wow .
Bns003_428	I see th ; Yeah , I talk to Jane about this . ; Uh , ; Yeah ,
Bmr029_346	or was it ? ; Uh , with the Robust - compared to Robustness ? ; Yeah . ; The big variation is by whether it 's a native speaker or not .
Bmr003_848	Mm - hmm . ; and ; Is this already in the past or already in the future ? ; Already in the past .
Bro012_145	That would be lovely , ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; " See how different these sequences of numbers are ? "
Bmr020_949	So you 'll you 'll have a chunk of , you know , channel A which starts at zero and ends at ten , ; and then the same channel starting at eleven , ; ending at fifteen , ; and then again , starting at sixteen ,
Bro024_1245	Mm - hmm . ; Middle - sized one . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_809	he he does the uh uh th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . ; And he he always talks about these ; He he already well ; i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .
Bed006_1577	Yeah . ; So three is sounds good ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_188	Right , right . ; read it single . ; It 's just easier to read . ; The spaces already bias it toward being separated .
Bmr018_777	I mean , I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns003_941	So , but anyway , I would like to get contributions from the people here of the NSA group concerning proposals , ; this is a living thing ; and ; it 's a pity that Multicast is , in principle , removed
Bed015_1253	Correct . ; This is just basically says ; It 's a grab bag of ; " part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas .
Bmr013_20	It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . ; Uh - huh . ; With Don , as well . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2305	OK . ; Yeah . ; in a way . ; Same with " I don't know " .
Bed006_608	And um . ; But they 're shown like on a screen . ; It 's a I mean so would the generator , ; N
Bro011_571	Mm - hmm . ; and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits ; Mm - hmm . ; and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .
Bmr010_1219	or or if that 's , um ; I mean , i I I don't know what uh , level of detail would be most useful . ; I don't know i if that 's something that I should do when I look over it , or if we want someone else to do , or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_393	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; That 's sort of what 's left . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2254	Yeah . ; So , th it 's kind of like that . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro007_289	Uh ; It the the output silence of the MLP . ; Oh yeah ; I see .
Bmr016_1588	Yeah , that 's pretty close . ; right , ; and the PTA was in these , uh , topics about children , ; That 's not bad .
Bmr023_970	So , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . ; It still wasn't a big deal . ; OK . ; Well , but , um Well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences
Bmr031_732	Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even , ; and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions . ; You just partition them into multiple . ; Yeah .
Bro017_35	that they were trying to decide ? ; There is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues . ; Like the voice activity detector , ; Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector .
Bmr027_902	Six . ; Six ? ; But , no of different people . ; So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot .
Bmr009_477	Well , it would be lost no matter what you do . ; But ; as well . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_387	Yeah . ; So . ; It Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings ; He 's getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again in mid - January .
Btr002_142	And then , ; um , ; let 's see . ; There 's one other here I thought was interesting .
Bro010_1148	or ? Does it use one microphone ? ; o ; Several microphones ? ; o
Bed009_768	so it 's speed is crucial . ; uh ; And they are not fast enough . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_623	Machine , I mean . ; Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , ; but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . ; I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it .
Bmr023_295	Mm - hmm . ; And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth , ; because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working . ; Right .
Bns002_359	Yeah . ; while data packets can be much mor much bigger . ; Let 's say uh one - K , five - K - s . ; OK ?
Bmr005_305	But no . The inference stuff was was was Lokendra . ; OK . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; That makes sense , yeah .
Bro016_731	Yeah . ; But ; R right ? ; Mmm .
Bmr014_998	Having it . ; Giving it to them . ; right ? ; OK .
Buw001_1387	That 's that 's ; Yeah . ; I I I mean , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system ; Right .
Bro012_1223	It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and he was
Btr002_2378	This cou Is this the one that ; I mean , it could be the one that we were thinking about . ; It could be . ; But I noticed it more as it was obviously not
Bro016_242	So , I mean , the insertions is is a symptom . ; It 's a symptom that there 's something , uh , wrong with the range . ; Right . ; But there 's uh , your your your substitutions tend to go up as well .
Bed006_831	we know a lot about sources ; so we 'll put all of that in Source . ; OK . ; But it 's independent whether we are using the SPG schema in an Enter , View , or Approach mode ,
Bed011_49	And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . ; so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . ; So to do that , we need to do two things . ; One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount .
Bmr011_1396	Yeah . ; Plus we could also get you know , a s a student . ; OK , next week you 're going to do it all . ; Yeah .
Bro013_628	you could you could uh do a very rough thing to estimate estimate uh pitch . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And uh uh , given you know , given that , uh you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by uh uh those harmonics .
Buw001_205	There were others of course . ; Yeah . ; OK , so we were on the data collection and the summary issue . ; Right .
Bmr003_1957	Right . ; The question is what is what 's he looked at . ; That 's true . ; Which one do you use Jim ?
Btr002_1035	I think so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed016_471	and the offices are in in the glass half - dome . ; Really ? ; Alright , let 's stop talking about this . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_494	this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . ; I actually gave ; Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ? ; Oh yes .
Btr001_1768	I don't know how you do it , ; Right . ; Right . ; but it 's still a laugh .
Bed009_272	So this is one that already adds additional information to the ; Makes perfect sense . ; Yes . ; Hmm , ah .
Bns001_493	Uh . ; OK ; Oh , OK . ; Good luck .
Bmr013_24	Got it . ; Anything else more pressing than those things ? ; So So , why don't we just do those . ; You said yours was brief , so
Btr001_1527	Leak their secrets ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But they 're very fast .
Bed015_166	Yeah . ; So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I ; Yeah , yeah . ; It 's used shouldn't matter , right ?
Buw001_941	Yeah . ; Um , but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . ; Right . ; I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot
Bed002_493	o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get . ; Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , ; but tha ; In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis .
Bed004_869	So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ? ; I 'm I 'm happy to do that . ; We we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine . ; Yeah , um , Liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time .
Bro003_186	y You just described what you 've been doing . ; Yeah . ; So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing . ; Oh , this is
Bmr029_35	It depends on who else is using machines , ; but we have more machines now . ; So . ; That 's true .
Bed006_1112	Well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing ; because uh I mean many actions presuppose some um almost infinitely many other actions . ; So if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1177	Um , and I 'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see , um , from those patterns ; uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes . ; And maybe maybe some , uh , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um , that the neural net learns . ; Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ?
Bro004_1065	Yes , I don't know . ; That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question , ; then now that it I understand it . It 's ; " yeah ,
Bro012_1203	So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch . ; And ; um ; you from that you you estimate
Bro023_1146	Sometimes . ; I mean , it 's not clear that these musical noises hurt us in recognition . ; Hmm . ; We don't know if they do .
Btr001_2041	It would really be interesting . ; Yeah . ; Cuz I know it was mentioned . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1660	And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network . ; Uh ; So we 'll do that t maybe uh ; But .
Bro025_278	In some cases it divides the error rate by two . ; Wow . ; So it means that there are stim still ; If if we can have a good VAD , well , it would be great .
Bro019_867	I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ? ; The signal subspace ? ; Yeah . ; The
Bmr021_406	I guess ; And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around . ; About the only difficulty with that is if it 's compressed . Then you really do have to decompress it first . ; That 's true .
Bed006_438	and also uh I think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task ; and then take the test away the the the the the text away ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed017_447	but the problem is obviously the scalability . ; And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , ; which does exactly this , ; but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend .
Bmr013_428	OK . ; And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . ; Might not be , you know , exact features that , Jakobson thought of or something . ; But I mean you know some , something like that .
Bed014_685	Of that object . ; changes . ; For But ; Right .
Bed006_765	Mm - hmm . ; So in the future ; So it 's just an additional information ; Exactly .
Bed008_477	Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business . ; OK . ; Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? ; Um things .
Bns001_927	I I think the potential is still there . ; You you neglected that , ; but I don't think that you are right in that sense . ; Well , think it works ,
Bro017_165	Now they want to make sure their criterion is ; Right . ; And I think that this is not the right way . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1278	Like , suppose you fixed some typ No , Jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the word error , ; then we can f we c ; Right . But but If the segments change , that won't work . ; Y Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr006_1160	Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . ; But I suppose ; Are probably better , yep . ; Yeah , yeah yeah ,
Bmr015_1179	if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , ; and , uh , we we didn't have noise , ; we didn't have convolutional errors , ; we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth ,
Bro003_511	I was just wondering because that test you 're t ; Uh - huh . ; I I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech . ; That 's right .
Bro024_570	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I do . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro018_454	So I 'm I I just need to ask um Malek . ; One more . ; Um . Tsk . ; Then uh I talked a little bit about um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events ,
Bed016_1165	instead of wh what you know how was this painted , ; what color was this painted , ; um , ; was this alleyway open .
Bed004_458	Mmm . ; And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about . ; So that y so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing ; OK .
Bns001_1304	what the whole internet community has um done in in si since uh since a decade . ; But we can f pick up some f some um potential and and and to start with something . ; And that 's my missing point . ; That we have here , in principle , really the description of this problem I mentioned
Bsr001_1971	Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces ; but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_212	I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it . ; Maybe this is a little better . ; Yeah , ; That 's really nice .
Bmr003_1960	Which one do you use Jim ? ; I use something called Trellix . ; Oh , that 's right . ; I remember .
Bro014_754	So it 's better than the system that we had before . ; Yeah . ; Mainly because of the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD . ; OK .
Bmr029_17	Right . So so , we have some stuff with no overlap , uh , for which there would be near near - field results . ; Uh - huh . ; We wanted to get the far - field results for that . ; And then this this real , uh , long shot thing would be , that we 'd apply Dave 's processing to , uh , potentially training and test data
Buw001_54	What ; What ? ; Y I think your your your thing may be pointing in a funny direction . ; It 's not that long .
Bro021_934	No . ; No . ; That doesn't follow . ; Well , if E restricts
Bed015_1028	And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? ; Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , ; general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f ; you know , specific X - schema frames .
Buw001_1224	from the summary . ; That was sort of what my question was aimed towards . ; So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it ; Hmm .
Btr001_1556	Yeah , I liked transcribing . ; Oh , interesting . ; Mm - hmm . ; I You know , I feel I feel like it was , um , more personal .
Bed009_188	OK . ; and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bns002_288	One is really really ; This one . ; This one , n next slide is ; OK .
Bed003_1034	n uh ; Let 's see . ; Yep . ; Let 's see ,
Bro019_330	Yeah . ; So , ; uh , shall I start from ; Well I don't know how may I how
Bmr013_510	Oh , OK . ; uh I think that would be a good i good idea . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , I mean ,
Bmr026_820	and Um . ; So . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system ; and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems ; and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .
Bro017_1295	That 's why Intel of course is distributing it , ; Well . ; right ? ; Or That 's
Bmr010_1147	OK . ; Yeah . ; Th - that 'd be I think that 's a a good idea . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_349	Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . ; Yeah . ; For some of it . ; Right .
Bmr027_1331	Yeah . ; so it 's really ; Yeah . ; Um . Yeah . I was just going to comment that I I 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with Mari tomorrow , late afternoon .
Bmr028_1735	Right . ; just for all these other purposes . ; So . ; And we have so many .
Bmr006_801	Yeah . ; Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . ; Oh ! ; Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ?
Bmr008_228	Yeah . ; Right . ; But when we did the Spanish call , many people said " oh I want to be uh have a post - doc slot " and they were twenty years out ; Yeah .
Bmr006_894	Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . ; And , um , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and
Bmr006_828	" Why ? ; Why ? ; What 's the reason ? " ; because i it 's the first study .
Bed015_1711	Uh . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , isn't I mean , I 'm I was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space ; and then builds up
Bmr024_138	Well , I think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps . ; Right .
Bmr010_585	but the , you know let 's let 's just , uh , say ; Mm - hmm . ; maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side . ; I could send Brian the , um the transcript .
Bns002_1507	but these are then the official ones , ; and I would like to have them ; And all of them had agreed , ; or ?
Bed014_1054	Fine . ; Yes . ; Uh . Would you like to ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1594	So it 's ; But but , uh ; S ; Yeah .
Bed017_221	OK . ; So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , we aren't gonna build our own interpreter ,
Bmr011_122	u although , not too close . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right , ; so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is is c correct .
Bmr003_1407	Mmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog
Bed011_322	So um , I ; Although ; Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_719	As as he is wont to do . ; Yeah . ; Uh , yeah . ; So I was actually that day I was thinking about d doing something about the Wiener filtering , and then Carlos matter of stuff .
Bro014_1391	So probably we 'll have to use , like , long f long frames . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro028_1158	you want to suppress , uh , the aspects of the input signal that are not helpful for for the discrimination you 're trying to make . ; So . ; So maybe just briefly , uh ; Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing .
Bro027_1282	and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ? ; It 's it 's pretty different . ; Isn't it ? ; Uh , there is a car noise .
Bro014_1394	Hmm . ; Oh . ; That 's interesting . ; Mmm .
Bed009_656	Mm - hmm . ; And to run that back through uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around . ; hmm ; And a I a a good design would would allow that to happen .
Bmr016_1654	Yep . ; On the page two of acronyms . ; Yeah . ; Is this after like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of " OK " to this ?
Bed003_1223	Right . ; And um let 's make those four . ; And maybe there are two um ; So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer .
Bmr006_382	I mean , that 's that 's ; OK , so ; We 're set up for it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1467	First you do a context - independent PTM model . ; Then you switch to a context ; You do two iterations of that . ; Then you do two iterations of of of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures .
Bro023_560	But actually their alignment actually is not seems to be improving in like on all cases . ; OK . ; Oh , i ; Yeah ,
Btr002_41	Hello ? ; It 's great . ; Thanks very much . Thanks very much . ; Alright .
Bro023_1041	So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh
Bro024_488	So I was like looking into " why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? " . ; Why why I was not getting it . ; And I found that , the noise estimation is a reason for the TI - digits to perform worse than the baseline . ; So , uh , I actually , picked th
Bmr007_1219	Yeah , it 's more obvious that there was something there than if there 's just silence . ; Yeah , that I mean , he 's he 's removing the old thing ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1126	subtract that from the original signal and you 're set . ; That 's ; OK . ; Wow . Interesting .
Bmr029_473	Right ? ; So . ; But , um ; It 's just easier to do .
Bro004_905	Twenty - seven broad classes . ; So like , uh , ; oh , I don't know , ; like back vowels , front vowels .
Bmr012_1182	you need a transmitter . ; What ? ; Is th isn't that built into the mike ? ; Oh I see .
Bmr019_611	OK . ; OK . ; I think that 's the key thing . ; And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .
Bmr009_72	Or of things that ; No . ; Between ; Neither .
Bmr002_766	I guess . ; Yeah . ; Is that free ? ; I don't know .
Btr002_2917	Yeah . ; y you ; I think , um , silences are generally like not good in conversation too . ; Cuz once you get a sil
Bed015_1469	So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? ; So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me . ; Yeah . ; Um , hearer is a little bit harder .
Bmr005_1437	or what about people in the in the building ? ; Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo ; I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and ; Yeah .
Bro018_679	but there 's you know , it was th reasonable . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I don't remember anymore . ; I don't even remember what the task was ,
Bed004_841	so there 's all sorts of things you might ask that involve the castle as a container ; and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container , you crank up the appropriate stuff . ; Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1056	Well regardless , it 's ; I mean it 's ; Yeah . ; I I think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two you know , the begin and end times .
Bed002_1194	I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . ; OK , I wasn't . ; So this was was a usual jo ; Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that .
Bmr009_690	I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing . ; Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window . ; And the And they could be quite different . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2472	I I I I 'm I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; right ?
Bro016_321	and then continue with with what we 're doing . ; Right . ; And as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front - end also then becomes a priority for this particular test , ; and saying you don't have to do that .
Bmr024_1048	Yeah . ; but ; no , ; but Andreas 's point is a good one .
Bro023_802	Ma ; So just th ; Makes sense . ; Yeah ,
Bro022_892	So , yeah . ; It it might be that what I did is ; so , removes like low , um , uh low - energy , uh , speech frames . ; Because the way I do it is I just I just combine the two decisions
Bro026_1055	I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , ; but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise . ; You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1190	Yeah . ; See ya . ; See ya . ; Um , oh , before you l go
Bmr007_938	Absolutely . ; eh . ; Mm - hmm . ; This this is the idea .
Btr001_358	He ; I mean , if you knew look looked back at it , ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's kinda cool .
Bmr024_429	Oh , OK . ; The references for for those segments ? ; So , there 's actually ; It 's not that
Bro026_579	That 's what ; So they have released their , uh , document , describing the system . ; I see . ; Maybe you could , uh , point it at Chuck ,
Bro011_586	Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter . ; So the majority of them wanna have nine states . ; And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . ; So my guess uh
Buw001_1125	so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? ; I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , ; Mmm . ; so that it may not be a feasible thing .
Bmr026_1105	Really ? ; They were very close . ; Yeah . ; That 's weird .
Bmr008_1338	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; You know , so if if there 's uh a really bad fit between where the pitch is going in this suppose uh hypothesized region of overlap , and the the and one or the other uh side , you know , then this this this might uh , suggest a ; Another side .
Bmr016_1876	So , exactly , that 's where the lengthening comment c came in . ; Anyway . ; Right , thanks , ; Subtext .
Bro021_875	The top Y is what ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Is that power spectrum ? ; Uh , this is the noisy speech .
Bmr002_1436	They 're much more expensive . ; OK . ; I I Which I don't understand ; but there it is .
Bmr002_795	so it 's it 's um pretty broad - based . ; " TEI " is ? ; These things do seem to be ; Mitre ,
Bro012_266	Yeah . ; You said on the other cases you didn't notice ; But . I think , ; yeah .
Bmr003_2276	I mean , some sort of cabinet . ; Well I can build a cabinet . ; The the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2941	Mm - hmm . ; Interesting observation . ; Yeah . Well , if they 're i c if this has raised a couple of things for me that I wanted to mention ; Yeah .
Bed002_23	Everyone would need extreme focus . ; So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . ; Other way . ; We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage .
Bed003_470	but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . ; Mm - hmm . ; Rather , ; let me rephrase that .
Bmr003_2272	See ; so that it 's a little more presentable and organized . ; I agree . ; And I 'm I 'm just not sure what that is .
Bmr006_86	And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group ; because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . ; S So ; Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .
Bmr010_188	to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted . ; So . ; Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that . ; Yeah .
Bed016_1127	But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see , ; um , ; Right . ; s See you .
Bro017_407	Mm - hmm . ; or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh ; that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors , ; and
Bmr003_644	Yeah , really . ; There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , you can you could get people to to um , to do it in exchange . ; Well , i b but seriously , I I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this ; Right .
Bro012_674	Oh . ; So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1494	We did get our , um ; I 'll be interested . ; I guess , good news . ; We got our abstract accepted for this conference ,
Bns003_736	there . ; We 're not talking about to send the students here to I C ; S I . I 'm talking if there is an activity , at least with the NSA group , that certain kind of activities also in the university could apply for the master works , of diplomas thesis , uh , whatever kind of thing that ; Yeah ,
Bed008_99	but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr003_309	Well they they certainly wanna collect more data . ; And so they 're applying , I think I B ; Is that right ? ; I don't know .
Bmr031_137	He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page , ; Pie . ; which shows the amount of transc amount of data that had been transcribed ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_628	this is ; Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming ; Yeah . ; which probably will blow all our theories ,
Bmr027_1403	So . ; If you wanna do a quick ; Yeah . ; ten minute
Bro023_199	th um , yeah , ; I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system . ; Like , may maybe if I trained on six seconds it would work better when I only had two seconds or four seconds , and ; Yeah .
Bmr010_15	Yep . ; Pretty much . ; OK . Does anybody have an agenda ? ; No .
Bmr006_324	You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . ; You can use found data . ; Ye - Yeah . Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro025_283	Is it significant , ; Uh , right now it 's , um , a neural net with nine frames . ; or ? ; So it 's forty milliseconds plus , um , the rank ordering ,
Btr002_3172	which is a which is a a filler item . ; Right . ; Does have a meaning . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1551	haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally , ; so . ; Um . ; Yeah ,
Bed013_741	OK . ; And say , this is bad . Nuh ? ; Yeah . ; And then we can say , uh well what we do is this .
Bmr024_1191	Yeah , I got confused by the results . ; It sai because uh , the meeting before , you said " OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent " . ; That was on males . ; Right .
Bro014_678	So what happened since , um , last week is ; well , from OGI , these experiments on putting VAD on the baseline . ; And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation , ; so spectral subtraction ,
Bro019_196	Mm - hmm . ; So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1061	we can use our own intuition , ; and see how hard it is , ; and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . ; So it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .
Bro027_673	And ; let 's say ten milliseconds seconds for the LDA . ; and but the LDA is , well , pretty short right now . ; Well , ten .
Bed010_336	Is is that right ? ; I mean that 's that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ? ; Absolutely . ; OK .
Bmr031_358	But , uh , if if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something . ; Yeah . ; Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that ; and just take whatever comes from the other places ,
Bro007_320	I thought that was the one I thought that was the second row . ; So what 's the difference between the second ; Uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just ; Oh .
Bro028_342	but ; What if you did LPC - twenty ? ; LPC ? ; Twenty .
Bns003_492	and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there . ; So , that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be , um , shown or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Of course that is a living thing .
Bed005_763	Yeah , that would be fine . ; Right . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_698	Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will ; I didn't know that actually . ; Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions , ; Yeah OK .
Bed006_1814	OK . ; like enough for me to think about . ; So . ; OK , so Friday ,
Bro024_800	but , i somehow there is u u there is no longer a a Gaussian distribution . ; It is somehow a strange distribution which we introduce with these artificial distortions . ; And and I was thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problems in the especially in the multi - condition training mode . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_190	so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh . ; OK . Now having said that I 'm I 'm impressed by h how by how , um well , how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are .
Bmr026_1028	Yeah . ; It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . ; Because our our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2295	That 's right . ; and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way . ; Um . ; Including , I mean , every little aspect .
Bro011_276	and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . ; Great . ; Great . ; Yeah actually um he should uh
Bed005_1423	The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter ; and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form , ; and if you say , " hey , we 're gonna make a different kind of data structure to stick in there " ; Well , no , but that just means there 's a protocol ,
Bmr002_1346	and Jane and I will look at it ; What about r our recording schedule ? ; Oh ; How many meetings are we going to record ?
Bed006_867	OK . ; Tell us more about it . ; What do you what do you ; What 's that ?
Bsr001_2516	I guess we could write them down and then read them , ; but . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr024_301	You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . ; And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels , ; Yeah . ; but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation
Bed013_1425	Which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue , after the thir thir after July , we can . ; We could . ; And , um ; and that 's also maybe interesting for Keith and whoever , if you wanna get some more stuff into the data collection .
Bmr025_725	OK . ; So i if you take notes it 's a great little device . ; Could Mm - hmm . ; But I don't take notes ,
Bmr013_582	Yeah . ; And . ; Yeah , and and I had I had , uh , specific problems with . ; I get it .
Bsr001_2574	For volume , it 's a point source pretty much , ; Mmm . ; yeah . ; Hmm , hmm .
Bro025_526	But ; Mm - hmm . ; but ; Yeah , I guess .
Bmr009_966	eh The original is the center of Spain and the beca ; Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want . ; For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one . ; So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want .
Bmr026_735	We feel We feel obligated to collect more data . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Ugh .
Bed010_170	Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? ; But none of that has a short time fuse . ; OK . ; So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .
Bro004_1208	So um I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this ; because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result ; and therefore will help within an evaluation . ; Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know .
Bmr023_1217	and another one , since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs ; Mm - hmm . ; and then concatenated that . ; Mmm .
Bro012_669	OK . ; um j ; I used it a long time ago ; but it 's been a while
Bmr015_282	Yeah . ; Yeah ? OK . ; Um , ; so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in
Bmr028_1383	Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments . ; Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties , ; and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets . ; It was really hot .
Bro003_994	it 's just trying it out . ; So , we actually can do quite a few experiments . ; But how how long does it take , do we think , for one of these trainings ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_336	What 's the plan if were we still going to be like a center for transcribing data ? ; What happens if th they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources ; I ; or ?
Bed008_932	maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . ; And I don't worry about layout , ; Yeah . ; I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts
Bed006_1773	Everybody likes action . ; Oh . ; Yeah . OK . ; Yeah .
Bro014_314	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; so they said " how much is significantly better ? ; what do you ? "
Bed002_924	I g She 's a g ; Is she an undergradua ; She 's graduated . ; She is a graduate , OK .
Bro026_57	I can actually do it ; today . I mean , I can just log into ; Have you tried it yet ? ; No , I didn't .
Bmr023_1200	Oh , OK . ; So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , uh uh , in the Aurora thing . ; Oh . OK . ; Yeah . That makes sense .
Bmr019_91	So , anyway , I can talk about digits . ; Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ? ; I mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . ; Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i
Bro017_950	It might be . ; Could increase the variance to decrease the importance . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_829	Are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ? ; so ; Mel cepstrum . ; So probably doesn't matter .
Bro012_96	So . So uh , but uh , ; Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went " oh , man . ; Why didn't I notice that ? " ; Hmm .
Bro019_1571	Mm - hmm . ; um , of a complex value and its conjugate . ; Um . ; So for each
Bro023_175	Ye - yeah . ; Most of the silence has been cut out . ; OK . ; Just There 's just inter - word silences .
Bmr031_522	Well , with NIST I think ; so . ; they 're they 're in a different situation cuz they 're doing video . ; And so compared to the video , the audio is just noise
Bmr008_1620	And then do your normalization based on that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And once you do that just for voiced ,
Bro021_876	Mm - hmm . ; Is that power spectrum ? ; Uh , this is the noisy speech . ; p s this
Bro007_606	and uh ; we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh ; um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection ; and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now
Bmr001_323	Three , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah
Bro010_55	Mm - hmm . ; Well , similar , but that have shorter delays . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they had two filters ,
Bed015_1748	Yeah . ; Hedges ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Hhh , I there used to be a slot for speaker , um ,
Bro021_1326	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; The question is , um , whether it would be helpful , i particularly if you used if you had more ; So , suppose you did ; This is almost cheating .
Bmr031_1583	Yeah , OK . But that 's not really feasible ; Everything up to that point . ; because you 're having a sys you have a system , a dialogue system , where you only have access to the what the speaker said before . ; Yeah ?
Bmr019_1240	Yeah , that 's right . ; Well , this is this is just ; Yeah , this is like a poor man 's ver formatting version . ; But it 's , you know It 's clean ,
Bmr009_270	But ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; But It it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the in the mixed file , in one channel that eh in several oh e eh several times eh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy
Bed013_1468	OK . ; If you want . ; Right . ; It 's always fun .
Bmr003_2328	so ; the , uh the flat panels . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah !
Bro012_21	and you know , are we getting hurt there ? ; But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there . ; So . ; So there was a question of whether we should change things here ,
Bro015_134	And it was not better than what we had before . ; And ; Then he tried to put the on - line normalization and it did not improve further , ; putting the on - line normalization ,
Bed015_866	Right . ; That 's fine , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .
Bmr009_445	Yeah , no , that was That was a jok ; So . So . ; or a sort of , a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals . ; Yeah .
Bed009_330	Now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that . ; For the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu ; and the while you 're debugging you will just ; OK .
Btr001_258	But ; And I found that I could ; if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this " ; and then I figured out what they were saying .
Bro022_452	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; But but , ; OK . ; typi
Bmr002_793	I see . ; and uh ; so it 's it 's um pretty broad - based . ; " TEI " is ?
Bed015_862	Exactly . ; But figure out how the ; Yeah . ; But , uh , if you don't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways ,
Bmr030_409	I mean , cuz , originally I had disc discounted that ; because it was just gonna be too hard . ; But now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out . ; Yeah . So the only difference would be , we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM .
Bmr014_953	Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . ; Right ? ; So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the ; Yeah .
Bed006_1758	Like ; because it e evokes whatever RDF ; Oh . ; RDF is the biggest thing
Bed002_1311	but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . ; So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there . ; Right , yeah . ; Probably not then ,
Bmr024_948	So how about ? ; Um , if you have them professionally pressed , y you know , they 're good for decades . ; So so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ? ; I think th
Bed017_584	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; So you you guys never sent anybody else from I U . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_748	So , when you were saying we need to do a re - run of , like ; h What ? ; What Like , just working out the rest of the ; Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days .
Btr002_2951	um , when we have these grey areas , ; um , w um , ; I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of segments , which really aren't part of a word . ; Have you run across that where they 're they 're saying
Bed009_860	Yeah . ; I mean it 's it was pretty ambitious . ; and ; And of course it was English oriented ,
Bmr013_597	And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . ; Well we did the hand ; the one by hand . ; Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on
Bmr023_971	It still wasn't a big deal . ; OK . ; Well , but , um Well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences ; Oh , yeah .
Bro012_1252	Yeah . ; Didn't the head dude send around that message ? ; Yeah , I think you sent us all a copy of the message , ; where he was saying that
Bed014_1147	Right . ; just change the just , like , mark out the ; Cool . ; Right , a little substi substi
Bro003_1577	and the the disks themselves are not that expensive . ; Right now it 's ; What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K , ; and it 'll tell you if there 's space available .
Bns003_91	Yeah , ; though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a ; I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance . ; You know , I I can I can build , eh , any computer uh you n installing whatever . It 's needed ,
Bmr019_1785	Have a good trip . ; Yeah . ; Thank you . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1086	So . ; So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at . ; But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what he , uh , came here with ; and branch out branch out from there .
Bmr024_1306	It 's Baum - Welch training . ; Baum - Welch training . ; And how do you determine when to to stop iterating ? ; Um
Bmr008_1593	Yeah . ; but eh I test different normalization ; I eh ; What kind of normalization ?
Bro015_170	Anything from your side ? ; Uh , continuing readings we come Uh . We 're doing some background reading on phonetics . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bmr028_1467	Which means that we weren't actually running it on on , uh , on data that had had no speech . ; And , in a sense , that was cheating . ; OK . ; So i so it it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people " well , we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way .
Bro017_957	Doesn't matter ; and ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed005_456	OK . ; Good point . ; It 's it 's the It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_65	I I I can chat with you about that off - line . ; That 's another thing . ; Um , And , Anything else ? ; Nothing else ?
Btr001_2007	That 's right . ; It Wasn't there ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_100	Actually , a PDF . ; But , you know , uh But , either way . ; PDF ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1271	Yes sir . ; We 're just waiting for you to leave . ; Anything else ? ; Nah .
Bro025_164	but we were considerably far behind . ; And the thing is , this doesn't have neural net in yet for instance . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know ?
Bro028_317	So now you put the pitch in . ; Uh - huh . ; What would the percentage be then ? ; Um
Bed011_640	Mmm . ; Yep . ; Sure . ; Yep .
Bmr031_1356	OK . ; So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um
Bro010_665	Yeah . ; But I think y um , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second . ; And ; well , five hundred wa was not so bad .
Bro010_1198	Uh , ; I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do ; But . ; well , not not very
Bmr029_61	if you want to do a full comparison . ; It has to be enough so that ; Uh . ; I mean , it 's the non - overlap only .
Bro022_713	Yeah . ; That 's what I mean . ; So , like , comple ; It 'd be a lot of work .
Btr001_1575	You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing , ; because it 's already there ; so you don't have to pay as much attention . ; That 's true .
Bmr028_535	However , I just got an email from Thilo saying that we are ready to run ; I mean , we have segmentations for the old meetings that are from his segmenter , ; And check the segmentations . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_160	So ; Well , of course people will not like it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution .
Bro014_254	And so ; Well , this is a point . ; And right now actually there is a thing also , uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_410	Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ? ; Uh not really . ; OK . ; Um There is the format of the table which is quite impressive .
Bro004_315	OK . ; Um ; OK . Well . We we we may just need to uh ; So I mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task didn't seem to hurt us that much ,
Bmr020_1568	That 's really ; I I did this on on four meetings and only five minutes of of every meet of of these meetings ; so , it 's not not that representative , ; but ,
Bro014_1444	and ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Uh , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source ,
Bmr010_1111	But what I mean is ; Oh , I shouldn't say it that way ; because that does sound like forty - hour weeks . ; No .
Bmr008_229	Right . ; But when we did the Spanish call , many people said " oh I want to be uh have a post - doc slot " and they were twenty years out ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1199	Mmm . ; Um ; Yeah , ; and the different points of the curves are for five uh , thresholds on the probability uh from point three to point seven .
Bed002_436	but that 's boring . ; And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . ; So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , " whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . ; Ask them which one you want . "
Bmr003_2585	Yeah , yeah , ; sure , ; right . ; And then we could
Bed009_225	and so forth . ; There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . ; And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . ; Information related to the user and information related to the situation .
Bro014_983	and , uh , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps . ; Mm - hmm . ; So i is the idea that you 're going to take whatever features you develop and and just add them onto the future vector ? ; OK .
Bmr014_471	but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is , ; Mm - hmm . ; so gloss of whatever . ; Right .
Bro008_176	um , so that 's a nice feature of what what we did . ; Um , ; but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_439	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's amazing . ; So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?
Bro007_344	Uh I guess , yeah . ; Yeah OK . ; I guess , yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_553	And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under " participants " they were filled in under " description " . ; Ah , OK . ; Uh ; And so that 's also a problem .
Bed016_921	OK . ; But um , ; those are interesting examples ; but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples .
Btr002_2251	and the phone is the levels are funny . ; Yeah . ; Then you hear it . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2265	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; It sounds like it 's a nice smooth melody , ; but these things are voicing and unvoicing , are tripping in and out , ; and they don't The contour is really not nearly that neat .
Bro012_451	Yeah . ; Yeah , it was actually updated . ; OK . ; Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago
Bmr001_774	Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean there 's it 's If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , probably .
Bro026_1070	And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . ; Well that ; Yeah . We 're we 're doing some sort of prediction of what ; Yeah , exactly .
Bro019_734	It 's it 's ; Because it ; OK , ; it 's
Bed012_743	The whole group . ; And we present our results , ; our final , ; OK .
Bmr016_1272	or is there something else in there . ; Oh yeah , so i e this would ; Let 's just take one example . ; A comment , basically .
Bro024_185	So ; I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech ; Huh . ; but it might make a difference .
Bed015_146	I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation ; but in form you might also have a value binding . ; You know , you could say that , um , you know , " name - one dot " , t you know , " number equals " , you know , a plural or something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1538	Yeah . ; I mean , wh what specifically , what you wanna do is remove the the the the average , uh , speaker tilt in some sense ? ; The thing i ; Yeah . We we you wanna use spectral tilt to try to get at the s n the voice quality of these utterances .
Bro025_13	Uh . Yeah , we formed a coalition actually . ; Yeah . Almost . ; We already made it into one . ; Oh , good .
Bns002_250	and this will produce , at least at these two nodes , a collision or a m a m a a re a bad reception . ; OK ? ; So none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node . ; OK ,
Bro027_1211	Yeah . ; I mean , one of the things about ; I mean , the Macrophone data , um , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_552	i endpoint , e end poi ; this is sa ; Ah . ; it 's the endpoint
Bmr023_615	and , uh an oral and written written version . ; Well . ; So that was stuff he was doing with you . ; I mean , it 's I guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount
Btr001_1486	Oh , OK . ; And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together . ; Cuz ; y OK .
Bed002_141	Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . ; And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , ; and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , ; as well as the close talking mikes .
Bmr016_1939	yeah . ; which means this is part of the numbers task . ; I may change it to " digits " . ; I mean , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want
Bmr009_335	and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps , ; Yeah . ; maybe ; and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern
Bmr010_1498	but ; Anyway , ; um , ; Yeah .
Bro024_1188	like the fact that the the models tend to align their first state on silence and their last state o on silence also . ; So the reference reference alignment would label as speech some silence frame before speech and after speech . ; This is something that we already noticed before ; when
Buw001_1027	But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , ; I d ; yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1000	Mm - hmm . ; that a actually is an assigned number . ; But it 's all only used for identification . ; That 's the only thing .
Bed002_500	So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh or We can assume that y you get this crude information . ; About intention , ; and that 's all they 're going to provide . ; And they don't give you the kind of object ,
Bmr023_47	Is Jane around ; or ? ; I saw her earlier . ; Uh .
Bmr003_1992	send me links ; and I wi ; send me pointers , rather , ; and I 'll put it together .
Bro023_176	Most of the silence has been cut out . ; OK . ; Just There 's just inter - word silences . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_821	Frame over fres threshold . ; So you take a each frame , and you compute the energy ; and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones . ; Hmm .
Bro022_28	OK . ; That 's a good idea . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_739	uh , we have time to ; This is a s just a sidetrack , ; but uh ; I think it 's also something that people have not done before , is um , sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of , uh , inferences , on
Bro022_18	Oh , yeah . ; It was very true . ; So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , uh , status report kind of things ? ; OK .
Bed015_1694	Well , but , uh , this is very good actually ; Schade . ; cuz it it it to the extent that it works , it y ; Ties it all into it .
Bro028_515	Other comparable systems from , uh were getting from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight percent . ; So they 're ; This is on clean test set ? ; This is on clean on clean stuff . Yeah .
Bed013_1445	Yeah , I 'll have to look more into that data . ; Is that around ? ; Like , cuz that 's pretty much getting posted or something right away when you get it ? ; Or ?
Bed003_620	I want to query , ; " Go " and , right , " query " . ; right ? ; the mode .
Bmr003_853	She she 's done one she 's one ; Yes I have . ; She 's she 's done about half a meeting . ; Oh - Oh , I see .
Bmr021_991	I don't know what they do . ; Maybe the batteries went dead , ; or th they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the " on " position or whatever . ; I don't know ,
Bsr001_231	They really press my temples , ; Uh - huh . ; Oh yeah . ; otherwise my ear channels ,
Bmr008_1394	so For each one , ; The product of the deviation is the vari is the variance . ; different than standard deviation . ; yeah .
Bmr005_489	Right . ; And It 's right . ; Yeah . ; But the problem is the following .
Bro012_37	he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail , ; but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested . ; We just run over the data before we deal with it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1394	So it 's like more like a filtering in time , ; rather than doing a r ; Ah . OK . ; So what i what about , um i u what i w
Bmr003_869	and and throw out the words , ; but keep the time markings . ; And then go through I mean , and go through and and try and re - transcribe it , given that we had perfect boundary detection . ; OK .
Buw001_139	Yeah . ; I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . ; The roll call . ; Right .
Bed010_598	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o
Bmr006_1784	because for discourse you don't need the audio . ; Right ? ; So you could bleep out the names in the audio . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_226	Yeah . ; So the three point four percent for this uh is is ; uh ; So why is it
Bmr029_249	Basically , we have to d r do recognitions for all three of those cases . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro019_309	because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions ; OK . ; So , ; I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting .
Bmr009_766	Yeah . ; There 's something we should talk about later ; but maybe not just now . ; But , uh , should talk about our options as far as the uh uh transcription
Bed008_497	now w we may wind up having to do that ; Hmm . ; this i anyway , this i ; OK .
Bro023_164	uh , ; by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back ; because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1570	And they find that the the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation is , uh is im important for speech recognition . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Sure .
Bmr020_1185	And in the other in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash , ; and I 'll go through and it and um , you know , with a with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category . ; I 'll just , you know , recode them . ; But um , um , the transcribable events that um , I 'm considering in this , uh , continue to be laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that ,
Bmr024_1516	But it it I st still see it as I mean , there 's there 's a history to this , too , ; Yeah . ; but I uh , I don't wanna go into , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_49	No , no , that 's OK . ; We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1534	to ; It 's Nutmeg and Mustard , I think , ; Do you know these yet ? ; I don't know what kind .
Bro012_339	And so if we can get away with just doing three , we can do many more experiments more quickly . ; And if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , um , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done . ; Hmm . ; And so . I 'll let you know what what happens with that .
Bro011_549	Huh ? ; You 're playing ? ; Yes , I 'm playing . ; Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task
Bro011_456	instead of using canonical mappings of phones . ; Right . ; So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_604	but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using to working with . ; So what what do we do now ? ; Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to eh , ; and we 've talked about this in other contexts
Bro012_730	Uh . And so I thought " Oh , this is good . " ; but I I just ; uh ; After after uh they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore ,
Bro028_411	Yeah , so ; Two two to six percent . ; It 's it 's one point four times , uh , to , uh , seven times the error , ; To f seven times , yeah .
Bro005_717	Mm - hmm . ; So , on the MSG uh problem ; um , I think that in in the um , in the short time solution ; um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress ,
Bro007_461	But uh we actually ; do we have the features ? ; Yeah . ; For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet .
Bmr011_935	And I I mean , I know you . I know what your voice sounds like . I 'm sort of familiar with ; Yeah . ; Uh , it 's pretty hard to follow , especially ; One side .
Bmr007_651	but maybe that 's obvious , ; maybe everybody knew that , ; Yeah . ; but that in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap ,
Bmr003_510	So this is a very good corpus . ; But , it uh it would also maybe help be helpful for Liz , if she wanted to start working on some discourse issues , you know , looking at some of this data and then , ; you know ; Right .
Bro004_1390	Because , um I think that 'll be running Linux , ; and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux ; so , um I could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux , and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first . ; Uh , probably the neural net
Bed012_350	The different decision nodes , you mean ? ; Yeah , the Go - there , the Info - on , and the Location ? ; Well , d yeah , this is making the assumption . ; Yes .
Bmr024_1619	Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms . ; Gets our ; Oops . ; We have a I found a couple of old ones .
Bmr031_1501	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . There was just no way to use the energy in Festival , that was ; Hey ! We could use that in the English
Bmr019_1396	Do uh , d d ; Um . ; Do not do not we are not setting a good example . ; Well , a relation other than negation , maybe ,
Bmr021_506	Yeah , so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet , ; but we should definitely double check on it . ; Yeah like like the same meeting shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording , looked , to the backup software , as if they had been written , you know , every single night , i for f you know , a week in a row , ; Yeah .
Bro022_617	But I don't think there 's any other difference . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_362	Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . ; There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have . ; So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . ; Right .
Bed003_1130	Mm - hmm . ; It 's , like , friendly , ; The d the data tables . ; it allows you enter things well .
Btr002_1937	so it was like kind of early on , right ? ; And , um , ; he everyone 's talking , ; and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else
Bro026_726	Um , I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there . ; Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? ; Yeah , it 's already there . ; OK ,
Btr002_1483	and then something down here , ; Exactly . ; Oh . ; and then you got the cha the different channels come out .
Bmr011_983	The networks group meetings are all ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1554	because um , the reference for example ; So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , ; Yeah . ; and this is where blends and all terribl
Bed002_717	If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . ; And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . ; So , yeah y you 're absolutely right , though . ; No , you you will not have ,
Bmr018_1476	And as I said , I like the Microsoft talk on scaling issues in , uh , word sense disambiguation , ; One of those w ; Yeah . ; that was interesting .
Bed015_122	so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . ; So . ; OK , then I don't think the , um ; at least
Bro012_1533	So we 're gonna read some more digit strings I guess ? ; Yeah . ; You want to go ahead , Morgan ? ; Sure .
Bmr028_366	No ! No ! ; Go ahead . ; I just figured you p ; There 's a link there that now says if you want to search by filter by a regular expression , you can .
Bmr018_1496	Yeah yeah yeah ; Well , it sort of was . ; was it w was it word - sense ? ; But it was it was a very simple case of " to " versus " too " versus " two " and " there " , " their " , " they 're "
Bmr012_1097	Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah . ; It 's a long time to get from LA . ; OK . ; And then nine channels is the maximum we can do ,
Bmr008_1723	I don't know . ; I I wanna think about it ; and you should think about it . ; Yeah .
Bro019_827	which is really giving them some improvement . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_259	And the counterargument to that which , say , uh , BBN I think had , was " yeah , ; but our second responses are second , uh , passes and third passes are really , really fast " . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , if if your second pass takes a millisecond who cares ?
Bed014_491	but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning " tell me how to get there " . ; Mm - hmm . ; So assume these are two , uh , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . ; Yep .
Bmr020_726	Yeah . ; the No vowels . ; Um , ; and then under there
Btr002_2842	I mean , if it 's a clarifying type like " well do you mean ? " when they 're partway through it in a utterance . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2424	it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Mmm .
Bro025_607	So , uh , I I don't remember what you said the answer to my , uh , question earlier . ; Will you will you train the net on after you 've done the spectral subtraction or the Wiener filtering ? ; This is a different net . ; Oh .
Bmr018_1053	Oh , not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel , ; Right . ; Right . ; but the speech from the a actual other channels .
Bro016_1149	um ; and test it on on Switchboard or , um , maybe even Aurora stuff . ; And , ; that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan .
Bro012_141	I don't mean a graph . ; I mean the actual numbers . ; Oh . I see . ; Oh .
Btr002_415	Yeah . It 's both labial at the end . ; Mmm - hmm . ; You know . And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant ; " Groups of "
Bro021_500	Cool . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That will be really interesting to see ,
Bmr024_402	We have so many of them , and it 'd be nice to actually do something with them . ; Well , we we we wanna have them . ; You mean there 're more than ten ? ; Yeah , I
Btr001_439	and then get farther away from that region ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and I notice it 's more and more difficult .
Bmr016_646	Probably how you wear it wore it I would guess . ; Or who was next to me or something like that . ; Yeah , where you were sitting probably affected it . ; Yeah .
Btr001_89	So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times @ @ what it is . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_170	Right . ; and since we have one already um ; Did Jerry talk to you about maybe using our class ? ; the students in the undergrad class that he 's teaching ?
Bmr031_275	Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words ; Sure . ; and " Yeah ! " and s stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_764	I 'm not really sure . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; D Do you know what kind of tying they use ?
Bns003_226	because nobody raised it before . ; Yeah , ; I think so . ; And , uh , so l let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards .
Bmr020_1371	Yeah . ; I don't know , ; I I think I 'm I 'm really tending towards ; One and a half times real time .
Bro027_206	I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester ; but they 'll do it any time , huh ? ; They seem to be ; Well , the semester actually is starting up .
Bro005_510	Yeah . ; Slightly bet better . ; Yes , is better . ; And and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case .
Bmr012_653	Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's really good . ; so Andreas set up this recognizer and ; by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there
Bed015_1890	And , um , so th these are this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with . ; Yeah . ; And then we 'll we 'll we 'll go back over it ; and w people will will give feedback on it .
Bro010_1135	Yeah , ; OK , ; so , um , ; we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition ,
Bed008_23	The database ones being in some sense less interesting to us ; although probably have to be done ; and so to do that ; so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things
Bmr005_1348	I think the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path . ; Right ? ; And and um d Do you have any idea when when uh the you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ? ; Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .
Bro004_196	I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , ; you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task , ; and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff . ; No no no .
Bsr001_1242	Right . ; There 's another company which also has a apparently has purchased a very a big multi - channel thing . ; may be giving us , ; uh - huh .
Bmr028_1724	I guess the troub trouble in my mind is that it that it 's not a very neat corpus ; if you say " these data are available , ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro026_349	Their their first system is fifty - four point something . ; Is it ? ; And , uh , we are fifty - three point something . ; And their second system is also fifty - three point something .
Bed002_115	OK . ; So , we 're trying to do real meetings . ; And so we don't wanna have to do aliases ; Right .
Bmr019_279	And is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here ? ; That I don't know . ; I don't know . ; I don't know how many speakers there are ,
Bro019_985	But for sure there 's required to that requires to re - check everything else , and re - optimize the other things ; Oh yeah . ; and , ; for sure the on - line normalization may be the LDA filter .
Bro018_820	I agree , ; and ; but I thought that the normalization difference was one of the possibilities , ; Yeah , but I don't I 'm not
Btr002_1007	Right . ; " I don't want you ! " ; Yeah , I do that too . ; Oh yeah , and then I 'll keep I keep caps - locking too
Bro023_1352	It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out ; we may or may not be able to add any latency . ; Yeah , but ; Yeah .
Btr001_1597	And so ; Yeah , I really do . ; Like I 'm I tend to take a little longer maybe than other people doing checking ; but like I I 'm like ultra - careful .
Bmr020_590	Yeah . ; so I d shrunk it to eight millimeters ; and that helped some . And stuff like that . ; Wasn't there wasn't there some result , Andreas
Bro021_644	but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're taking the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of ; because the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and and so forth . ; And and so if if you have a a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one It should be right around one , ; if it 's
Bed015_1508	You know , uh , uh , it 's the speaker may in English is allowed to say " I . " ; Yeah . ; Well , here ; Yeah .
Bro014_589	So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ? ; Uh . ; That 's not clear , ; but this e
Btr001_2754	Or no ? ; Well , I don't know , ; how do you feel ? ; Yeah , I don't care .
Bmr006_1464	Are they new ? ; Yep . ; Oh . ; Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to .
Bed005_436	Which is a means of telling the system to shut down . ; Right . ; Right . ; Now , if we know that " Write " produces a " Feature Discourse - Status Confirm Discourse - Status " .
Bmr016_184	And I think people will get it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And i actually it 's no more artificial than what we 've been doing with words . ; I 'm sure people can adapt to this ,
Bro019_634	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; w Uh , it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits , finally . ; OK .
Bro015_138	so . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro004_1077	Where does it come from ? ; Yeah , I don't know . ; Um , but uh to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it ; I was mostly thinking about the the VAD .
Bro024_806	the c the models are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you 're introducing . ; s ; Thanks Adam . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1156	OK ? ; Yeah . ; And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other . ; So , once this data gets out there , some people might start annotating this for , I don't know , dialogue acts or , um , you know , topics or what the heck .
Bro024_931	Like , uh I mean ; like like a spectral subtraction ; or ; No their filter is not M domain .
Buw001_296	Well , I think that we I mean , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings ; Well ; and send them off to IBM ; and get a bunch of transcriptions
Bns002_223	what what we have is a set of nodes , each one at a different location . ; At at at a at an at a given moment this eh node , this dash node is is transmitting ; and uh , the arrows are representing this transmission ; and the receiving nodes , these three nodes , are receiving the transmission ,
Bro018_676	and you know , it was the first time they tried it , ; so so the you know , the numbers were not incredibly good ; Hmm . ; but there 's you know , it was th reasonable .
Bro018_1219	Actually one percent is sort of you know , sort of in a reasonable range . ; People would say " yeah , I could I can imagine getting that " . ; Mm - hmm . ; And uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor .
Bed006_1082	But you know that 's just That 's just me . ; Like I I ; Well , I think we 're gonna hit a lot of interesting problems ; and as I prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it
Bsr001_1620	Good . ; Yeah , ; I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question . ; Oh , yeah .
Buw001_343	Uh , y ; I I think it 's an interesting thing . ; I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , ; but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? "
Bmr019_481	Right . I understand . ; But doing the same kind of limited thing ; Or or some high number . ; Yeah , sure .
Bro024_1357	So we might , ; yeah , ; We can do a realignment . ; That 's true .
Bro018_946	There 's nothing that lets you ; Yeah , I think that 's a fixed thing . ; But see see my point ? ; If you had If you had ten filters , then you would be throwing away a lot at the two ends .
Bmr031_409	S ; Yeah . ; Something like that . ; Oh , so that 's
Bro021_1172	uh , the compensation of the dictionary o one time ; using the the noise at the f beginning of the sentence . ; This is the first experiment . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_2055	You know ? ; Yeah . ; It sort of gives you your the best you could hope for , kind of . ; Mmm .
Bro026_942	OK . ; You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . ; I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_819	because I mean , you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York ; You know . ; Native - speaking New Yorkers , as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their You know . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr011_780	OK . ; And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . ; But , um , ; just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .
Bed003_873	So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , ; from that point of view . ; Huh . ; OK .
Bro010_404	and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . ; S maybe . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_530	and probably So ; Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , ; u ; on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike ,
Buw001_1913	I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages . ; That 's what we could do . ; You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor ; Yeah , why search for them ?
Bmr021_124	OK , n now may maybe I just don't know this ; but , um , are the only two possibilities from Sony the two that we 've tried ? ; Or is there another ; Yes .
Bro010_354	yeah . ; And , uh , ; Also we were thinking to to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson ; Yeah .
Bro004_604	the third part , ; so it 's uh highly mismatched . ; So . Training and test noise are different . ; So why do you get your best number in
Bed002_328	Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . ; And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . ; That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of of a phrase . ; So , this is , uh , really
Bro023_366	It 's the ; it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it . ; No , what 's what 's the number ? ; Uh , so I I don't have that number here .
Bro019_1034	OK . ; Maybe Roger ; r Roger , maybe in charge of . ; And then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to
Bmr006_1324	Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's ; Right . ; I mean , it 's not to say I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro014_1002	Yeah , it could be , uh it could be a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it could be in the also the big neural network that does phoneme classification . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2692	you know , it was like You really had to " let 's see , the words and the numbers " ; Yeah , you 're not used to seeing the numbers like that . ; and ; Yeah .
Bed011_621	or something like that ? ; Yep . ; OK . ; Um .
Bmr003_249	Right . ; I mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus ; and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . ; I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before .
Bed013_1224	Or I I don't know , ; The system doesn't massage you , no . No . ; or what 's something that they ; I I I don't
Bro019_1077	with with uh , connected digits . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , ; but uh , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech ,
Bmr008_1529	It 's li I think the last page . ; Yeah . ; Is it ? ; That 'll also lessen the standard deviation .
Bsr001_1965	well , indeed . ; I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @ should be working on these type of things . At least , ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr020_153	But any any help you need I can certainly provide . ; Well , ; Yeah . ; that 's that 's a great idea .
Bro008_369	So s so ; I see . ; So , yeah , ; so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we 've been , you know , typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in
Bed006_1487	The uh hhh , silence su sublimination ? ; Throwing somebody up the stairs ? ; Have you never read the Peter 's Principle ; Nope .
Bmr031_896	Yeah . ; So , I mean , it 's ; When I add a couple more from that , uh that were done in my absence , I think that th we 'll be down to about there . ; So it 's not quite as close to half as I 'd thought ,
Bmr001_621	Yeah . ; And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working . ; I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so ; Yeah .
Bmr002_448	And so , for the pilot thing , you know , of course this would be useful . ; Right , this is the pilot data . ; And I w I wou I 'm assu I 'm assuming that I would not be uh you know e eh uh transcribing all of it . ; Yeah , yeah , you are generating it .
Bro016_893	And , uh , sometimes , you know , there 's enough evidence for something to work ; and then it 's harder , ; it breaks . ; You know ,
Bsr001_1163	It could be . ; It 's ; it 's like you 're behind closed doors ; This could be the most popular corpus .
Bns003_358	OK , ; I will send you some because I have something in mind . ; So ; yeah ,
Btr002_663	uh , ; I see what you 're saying . ; a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech . ; Right .
Bmr031_641	It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short . ; Sorry . Thanks , Morgan . ; It 's really short , yeah . Yeah . ; Then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off .
Bmr024_803	So ; Hmm . ; Heidelberg ; Exactly
Bro011_141	but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you ; and and that and expected that they would do certain things ; Mm - hmm . ; and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you
Bed016_163	Yep . ; Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing . ; I 'm changing this . ; Just so you know .
Bed003_35	Aha ! ; OK . ; Should you go back to the first one ? ; Do I wanna go back to the first one ?
Bns002_533	yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's always true that only one node gets a media access , for one frame . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1186	Plus it 's gonna introduce delays . ; It does introduce delays ; but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_2033	It 's great . ; There 's a lip in these tables . ; Nice . ; And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded .
Bed006_1618	Do feel that we have done our chores for this week ; or ; Yeah . ; So I mean clearly there 's I can talk about the um the parser changes on Friday at least ,
Bro022_225	and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , ; uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh
Bdb001_1263	You know what I mean ? ; Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help . ; But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow , ; Yep .
Btr002_2974	and and that 's not communicative . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , my my the way I do those things when I hear those , if is to I use in parentheses one " X " so it 's marked . ; OK .
Bro005_382	I wonder why ; Yeah . Uh . ; Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , ; Yeah .
Bro017_1236	Yeah . They sent the release . ; And use this Intel version . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1782	Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge . ; Yeah . ; And I think And I think y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that . ; He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one .
Bed017_725	Mmm . Definitely . ; So anyway , that 's the end of the story . ; But for adults and not for the children . ; This was
Bmr009_1117	If you put eh the state ? ; Well well we sort of ; Where are you from mostly ? ; We we went we went around this and then a lot of people ended up saying that it
Bed011_313	I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . ; And . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bed013_190	So we wouldn't even have to t to kick start it by giving it a certain intention or observing anything on the decision node . ; And whatever that maybe that would lead to " what is the castle ? " , ; I 'm just ; or " what is that whatever " .
Bro005_796	If it 's on the target task then it it it helps to have the MLP transforming it . ; Mmm . ; If it uh if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance . ; Mmm .
Bmr008_194	Yeah . ; Maybe they 're fine . ; Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other ; So that , yeah , I think that 's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of ICSI v
Bed012_603	So . ; What d what do they need to do left ? ; Um , ; I guess , Jerry needs to enter marks ,
Bsr001_906	um , ; but of course we don't have any trained neural nets ; or , uh ; So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition .
Bro021_576	So but , you know , uh , you can get ; I don't know if you even want to run the big one , uh , um , in the in the final system , ; cuz , you know , it takes a little while to run it . ; So , um , you can scale it down by
Bmr006_1280	Uh , his a web page . ; You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . ; Subtract them . ; OK .
Bro011_101	Yeah . ; and that 's not taken into account right now . ; Um . Yeah . ; And there again , yeah .
Bro024_1251	Uh , ppp . ; I don't know , you have questions about that , or suggestions ? ; Mmm . ; S so
Bed014_503	Uh w that 's a s ; OK , so that 's a that 's a separate issue . ; Slightly different . ; OK .
Bed011_954	Well , I will tell you the German tourist data . ; OK . ; Because I have not been able to dig out all the stuff out of the m ta thirty D V ; OK .
Bns001_185	but this is oh , uh Everybody 's obliged to do it for his own , you know . ; Yeah . ; So there is not uh Claudia is not the webmaster here to , uh , get the collection for for for everything . ; OK .
Bro003_97	Yeah . ; Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front . ; And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time . ; It 'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day
Bmr005_372	Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone . ; Overlapping speech . ; With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech speech what eh different duration . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_37	So . ; I have something just fairly brief to report on . ; Mmm . ; Um , I did some experim uh , uh , just a few more experiments before I had to , uh , go away for the w well , that week .
Bmr015_172	Eight eight two two two nine . ; and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense ; and if anyone has any comments on it . ; I see .
Bro010_774	what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . ; Is is that right ; Yeah . ; or ?
Btr002_188	Mm - hmm . ; And then often , you know , i it 's , um , i there 's ex the parentheses are used , ; so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_748	Oh , you have to do it . ; You have to do it , ; yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr016_1597	so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where I mean it was low enough understandable ; understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said " OK . " ; You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym , ; but just n needs to be double checked .
Bmr008_1114	Mm - hmm . ; You know , source , destination , relation . ; Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ? ; Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to uh , things that have that bear on the content or the status relations , would be the things
Bmr030_633	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; That 's still pretty dang big . ; Yes .
Bmr002_580	in which case we 'll have to get them some other way , ; like with forced alignment later , ; I mean you know all this can be done . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_246	So we don't have start and end points at each point where there 's an overlap . ; We just have the the overlaps encoded in a simple bin . ; Well , OK . So @ @ the limits of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful . ; Because what would ultimately be , um , ideal in my my view
Bmr018_883	And so i and may you know , I mean , it 's ; I think that there always th there would have to be some hand - tweaking , ; but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things . ; I 've I 've discussed it with Thilo and I mean
Buw001_1232	Yeah . ; Or or just a memory refresher . ; I mean ; But that 's done off they have to do that off - line .
Bmr027_84	I don't ; I had heard July fifteenth , ; so that 's what I put . ; No , the only th the only mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts .
Bro010_945	um , we don't really know how those should be labeled . ; It could sh be that you should , um , not be paying that much attention to , uh , certain bands for certain sounds , uh , in order to get the best result . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that .
Bro028_874	So you don't have to change the training . ; You just do a measurement over the training . ; And then , uh , for testing , uh , you can do it for one per utterance . ; Even relatively short utterances .
Bed003_808	Hmm . ; " Is it Can it be entered ? " ; then of course , this is sort of binary as well . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1336	We 're supposed to get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . ; Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , ; uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , ; I never actually
Bmr005_1320	You know , you and maybe Adam ? ; You you could you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted . ; Would it help at all ; I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings .
Bmr031_1547	Yeah . Yeah . ; So ; Right . Exactly . ; And then you also have the different speakers .
Bed013_611	ASCII ? ; Let 's let 's wh wh what should we should should we uh , um , discuss this over tea ; and all of us look at the web ? ; Oh , I can't .
Bmr027_1327	A hundred gig here , ; a hundred gig there . ; Well , each meeting is like a gig or something , ; It 's eventually real disk space .
Bmr007_1194	uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how how you excise it ; keeping the timing right and so forth ; so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is is h putting the beep over it . ; Yeah , you can either beep or it can be silence .
Bmr013_857	So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . ; And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the at that level , are sufficient .
Bmr009_576	and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to . ; So if If you 're w willing to do that or or ; Well maybe we can ; It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes .
Bmr015_413	I don't I don't know . ; Yeah . ; I thought it was smaller , ; that it was like four or five ,
Bro023_1268	um , ; yeah , I mean , we 'll just have to try it . ; But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some . ; I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same ,
Bed015_1873	Yeah , right , I mean . ; Right , right , but , ; Right . ; No , no .
Bmr009_1552	I mean this isn't a program we wrote . ; Yeah . ; This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on . ; OK .
Bmr015_1073	but r very rarely . ; OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure ; Mm - hmm . ; and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as a master
Bro018_368	Does it have to do with those sixty - fours , ; or ? ; Um . ; If we ignore the sixteen , the natural log of t one over the natural log of two times the natu
Buw001_1287	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; for those pe people willing to stay . ; And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the
Bmr011_368	Mm - hmm . ; and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bro011_492	and uh he doesn't have to have hard labels . ; Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . ; Right . ; For the full band .
Bro024_729	Mmm . ; So that 's where the biggest improvement came up . ; Not much in the well match and the medium match and TI - digits also right now . ; So this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal .
Bmr015_420	I don't remember . ; they ; yeah . ; Uh it doesn't matter ,
Bmr007_870	Um I I think for , eh algorithm based on energy , eh , that um h mmm , more or less , eh , like eh eh , mmm , first sound energy detector . ; Say it again ? ; eh nnn . ; When y you the detect the the the first at at the end of of the detector of , ehm princ um .
Bmr003_277	The ; It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr002_1954	And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s still in the room ; Oh g ; and what the heck 's he talking about ? ; Wow !
Bmr024_72	maybe I said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it ; and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized ; and ; And I and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of of added ,
Bed011_171	Or can spend . ; Being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there ; if it is you know charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e ; whatever .
Bro024_1870	Oh ! ; It 's with the noisy . ; So ; Yeah .
Bro028_1142	Yeah . There 's the problem . ; So , that 's ; Yeah . Then it would work . ; But but , I mean , i it 's With finite of those things
Bro026_668	Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , ; right ? ; It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . ; Yeah .
Bro016_964	Not Thursday and Friday . ; Yeah . ; Cuz I will be at faculty retreat . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_885	Well , that was combined with the triangular . ; Right ? ; Yeah . Those those two were together . ; Yeah . Right .
Bro003_1991	Oh , ; um , ; we have gotten soft targets to to work . ; OK .
Bmr020_1343	and that is if we go ahead and we just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they listen to each section and say " yes , no " whether that section is
Bmr026_958	Exactly . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a better system
Bed009_805	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And yes the it the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that um Mark Light originally w worked on in while he was in Tuebingen
Bmr014_757	So that means other people are editing what you say ? ; Uh I don't know about that . ; Yeah . ; I don't know if I like that .
Bmr019_1103	It it 's not very fancy . ; It 's just a ASCII line by line format , ; but it does give you information ; It 's the it 's the spurt format .
Bed015_2024	And so I what I 'd like to do is is in the short run focus on getting it right . ; And when we think we have it right then saying , " aha ! , ; Yeah . ; can we make it more elegant ? "
Bro027_134	in terms of the noise . ; The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . ; Yeah . ; And and TI - digits maybe is not so much as
Bmr003_2365	If we bought you a a ; Oh , a Applecard . ; Sure . ; Right .
Bro017_675	Exactly . ; Oh . ; If you were at Bell Labs or I d d ; I shouldn't be saying this in on on a mike ,
Bmr013_154	So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . ; But . ; But Right . ; But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that ,
Bmr024_1278	And it is true that the , uh that the you know , we are using the ; Mm - hmm . ; But ; it can't be just the VTL ,
Bro018_701	Yeah , ; yesterday I brought Chuck the table ; and I was like , " wait , this is Is the mapping from N to to this phonological feature called um " coronal " , ; is is should it be shouldn't it be a one ?
Bmr011_990	I mean , ; uh , some point ago we thought that uh , it " boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that " , ; No , just ; Uh - huh .
Bro024_1275	And ; That 's right . ; OK . ; And also there are like funny noises on Finnish
Bmr018_1209	Cuz , I 'm just thinking , you know , we were we 're we 've been talking about changing the mikes , uh , for a while , ; see ya . ; Yeah . ; and if these aren't
Bmr008_1435	Because they they 're ; because you 're already left with a high standard deviation ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1227	OK . ; Hub - five . ; This is on ; This is Hub - five .
Bmr011_374	Uh - huh . ; Oh , did he ? ; yeah . ; Oh , that 's interesting .
Bmr007_1343	OK . ; OK , that 's let 's let 's let 's do digits . ; Get the bolts , " whh whh " ; Let 's do it .
Bed013_328	Who knows . ; Maybe . ; OK . ; Well , we 'll see him next week .
Bro008_117	but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System , uh , which is the biggest difference , I think . ; But but there 're there 're there 're some other differences , too . ; Uh , and and , uh , they both did very well , ; Uh - huh .
Bro018_901	Uh - huh . ; So one thing that I did notice , yesterday I was studying the um the uh RASTA code ; Uh - huh . ; and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis .
Bro027_885	There isn't any KLT or anything ? ; There 's a KLT after the neural network , as as before . ; That 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? ; Yeah .
Bro026_724	Uh , one one last question on that . ; When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? ; Um , I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there . ; Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ?
Bro008_107	So so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I think ; Um It 's probably a good time to look at what 's really going on and seeing if there 's a there 's a way to combine the best ideas
Bmr013_545	I was thinking it might be n ; I mean you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . ; Of the f acoustic features ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1752	Yeah , we w ; Yeah . We never had our data format discussion . ; Oh , I thought we did . ; Right .
Bed005_1431	That 's the question is " to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? " ; And I don't know . ; Well , no , but I mean What I uh the ; So you could have four different Bayes - nets that you 're running ,
Bmr010_295	But I 'm just wondering , is ? ; No , no . Praat isn't Praat 's multi - platform . ; No . No , Praat ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr031_1452	Which isn't really mad , ; but , you know . ; Yeah . ; So th they gave me a lot of feedback . The labellers , after doing this ,
Bmr014_662	I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . ; I mean if people have ; Uh , ; I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it .
Bmr011_304	Well that 's OK , I mean we 'll ; Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great . ; He he has a prototype . ; I I , uh , @ @ didn't didn't see it , uh , yesterday
Btr002_1616	the very beginning . ; Yeah , in the very beginning . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_912	But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done ; Well , yeah . ; Well , you can imagine ; The way I use a an a " AND " operator is
Bmr016_1016	And it 'll just go and pull out that section . ; I th ; w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that ; did they Jane ?
Buw001_1174	Yeah . ; Less ? ; So , I think ; It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free
Bmr031_1401	But , uh , ; Right . ; I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do . ; In the Aurora thing , we have we have a little bit of a handicap in that they they don't let you , uh , adjust the tis the statistical models .
Bmr012_470	Yeah . ; but for Broadcast News when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss . ; Right , it was not a big deal . ; Yeah
Bed005_1120	OK . ; And so , you other guys can decide how interested ; Yeah , @ @ . ; Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard .
Bmr022_86	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , we don't know what their process is . ; So I had two ideas . ; The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker I Ds .
Bed011_628	So it might be a tourist , ; it might be a business man who 's using the system , who wants to sort of go to some ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_673	but we could have you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American , ; We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization . ; I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_727	Yeah , but those are folded in , ; and it 's just you just mark the transcripts differently . ; So so one option is you fold it in , ; Right .
Bro025_540	and frame - dropping . ; So I don't have a I don't have a split , like which one helped more . ; Yeah . ; So . It it was the best result I could get .
Bed006_1285	But now you guys have seen the light . ; No , no , no . Uh we have not we have not seen the light . ; So . ; No .
Bed014_1119	So . ; OK . ; And , um . ; Sounds good .
Buw001_646	Right . ; And that the at some point that might be awfully useful . ; But I think adding photographs adds a whole nother level of problems . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_868	right ? ; d Well , yeah , ; where it actually is is covers the whole range of things . ; And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do ,
Bdb001_1184	Well , all the Switchboard in it . ; utterance types . ; Yeah . ; There 's , uh , automatic , uh , punctuation and stuff like that .
Bmr007_1251	Actually yours is the only one that I beeped and then , uh the ar DARPA meeting . ; Notice how quiet I am . ; Sorry , ; and then the DARPA meeting I just excised completely ,
Bed013_1034	and how does it fit to this , and what does it tell us , in terms of of the the what we 're examining . ; Mmm , yeah . ; And furthermore , I mean we can idealize that , you know , people don't change topics , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_31	well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask . ; OK audio monitoring , Jane . ; Ba - based on some of the tran uh i ; In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things ,
Bed013_713	um , right ? ; I m the the point is to like this " where is " case , or something . ; Yeah , maybe you have It would be kind of The paper ha would have , in my vision , a nice flow if we could say , well here is th the th here is parsing if you wanna do it c right , ; here is understanding if you wanna do it right ,
Bmr023_105	but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison . ; I guess we 'll see ; I don't know . ; i I guess it 's dependent on
Bmr016_1467	Ooo no . ; But you 're a native German speaker ; so it 's not a not a issue for ; Yeah .
Bed005_1343	I mean , you y ; Well , that 's ; Hhh . ; That 's that 's al different question .
Bed013_1261	Mm - hmm . ; whatever , conte infor in discourse information , ; such as the mood , ; and , you know , other stuff .
Bro004_201	So it improves , compared to the baseline . ; But ; So . ; Le - let me .
Bro007_513	Three PM here is in Europe midnight . ; Yeah , it 's it 's midnight but ; Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due , ; Oh OK .
Bed013_803	the uh , other thing , ; yeah we actually Have we made any progress on what we decided , uh , last week ? ; I 'm sure you read the transcript of last week 's meeting in red ; so sh so you 're up to dated caught up .
Bro021_1218	but conditional . ; No , it 's condition ; it 's not exactly this . ; It 's modify .
Bed014_602	But here 's here 's a way ; in th in the bl Bayes - net you could you could think about it this way , that if um at the time " admissions fee " was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter . ; Turn prior on . ; We - yeah th th that 's what I wa I wasn't I was I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas .
Bmr002_397	But but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that ; I kn ; Oh , I actually have some foot pedals for the P C . ; Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to
Btr002_845	Interesting idea . ; I 'll I 'll s I 'll suggest that to the charer . ; Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go . ; Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues .
Bmr002_1158	And we 'll run a train a neural net ; and create a recognizer ; and do information retrieval ; What ,
Bro005_918	but we don't know exactly why . ; Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is is the best . ; Uh , so . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_355	Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more , ; So . ; because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice , ; Mm - hmm ?
Bro024_1512	We would ; Right at the point where you 've done the subtraction . ; OK . ; Um , essentially you 're adding a constant into everything .
Bro021_425	Well , uh , that 's something 's ; Um . ; Yeah . ; Then
Bro010_1142	and , um , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . ; And so we 're interested in , um , comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that .
Bro014_703	Right . ; which was not done on our first proposal . ; When you say " we have that " , does Sunil have it now , too , ; I
Bed014_1305	Ah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , which was that o one of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called " Towards a formal cognitive semantics " ; which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all .
Bro017_582	finally we we 've not finished with this . ; We stopped . ; More or less it 's finished . ; Yeah .
Bro028_129	and we re - scale the other probabilities by one minus the silence probability . ; Huh . ; Um . ; So it 's some kind of hierarchical thing , uh , that Sunil also tried , um , on SPINE
Bro005_46	and also since the we 've started to run work on this . ; Um . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization ; but with delta also , ; because the column was not completely
Bmr026_87	Uh if if that 's OK with you to to , you know , get that stuff uh to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's ; Yeah .
Bed009_551	hmm ; In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr018_1331	Scenario - based . ; they have to do something like that , ; Y right . ; Their their legal issues won't allow them to do otherwise .
Bed010_878	I see . ; Right . ; And . ; Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .
Bmr013_791	right ? ; That 's what I should do ? ; Yeah . ; And .
Bmr016_1345	What 's that very last one correspond to ? ; Sure . ; I don't even know how to pronounce that . ; Well , yeah . Now that that s only occurs once ,
Bmr016_1731	Because we they didn't say " TCL " , they said " tickle " . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And then , following that is " QUAL TCL " .
Bmr015_664	Yeah . ; Cuz there are large s spaces of the ; That 's a good point . ; There are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all .
Bed014_1064	Alright . ; OK . ; I mean , I I I ; Is some some version
Bed006_926	a and the answer is absolutely . ; Yeah . ; The way we absolutely have those means that are even part of the M - three - L A API , ; Oh great .
Bmr029_89	I mean , so this is gonna be a lot worse . ; Right ? ; Whatever comparison we w w one would presume . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1165	And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to , um include the whole , um , reverberation ; um , I don't know what you call it ; the reverberation response . ; I if you see wh if you see what I mean .
Btr002_3251	Then what I do is , on Adam 's channel , I say I say , " Completing " And this this isn't that common of an occurrence . " Completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe " S " 's utterance " . ; Oh , I see . ; Oh ! ; Oh .
Bsr001_1739	Mm - hmm . ; So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed005_422	And so whenever I just say , " Write " , it will it will put this in here . ; Oh , so it always just ; Is it So it ; Well , go back , then ,
Bmr012_990	E eight each . ; So it it takes two fibers in to the one board . ; And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards , ; and then you have the synchronization issue .
Btr002_939	Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the " shift - backspace " as the collapser . ; Ah . Yeah . ; Because I 'll tend to delete things , ; Yeah .
Bed005_103	you know . ; And so forth . ; So I think we just go with it . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_452	Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They they haven't done it yet . ; OK . ; They wanted to do it ; I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work .
Bed008_1469	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Yeah , but that 's my question ,
Bed011_651	you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually , ; Yeah . ; you 're just want to approach it . ; So I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put
Buw001_2130	I think you are . ; We haven't sent anything to the list yet . ; Oh ! ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1506	Yeah . ; Um ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bro024_1337	So the alignments from the different database that are used for training came from different system . ; Syste ; Yeah . ; Then we put them tog together .
Bed005_718	I i it ; All the entities do have concrete reference . ; Right . ; Although th the To get at them from a language may not be trivial .
Bmr013_948	I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , uh , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . ; That 's very important . ; I have to run it . ; Right .
Bmr003_1149	Yeah , it 'd be cheap . ; Cheap to transcribe . ; So . ; But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out .
Bed016_371	But , you know , it would ; But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . ; I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , ; so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people
Bmr026_1060	I mean basically you would then You proceed with the embedded training . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway .
Bro024_275	um , r ; Well , I think what I was s I thought what I was saying was that , um , at any given point you are gonna start off with what you had from before . ; Oh . ; From
Bed006_1439	mainly meaning from the natural language understanding , or from the deep language understanding to the action planner . ; Mm - hmm . ; Now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back , ; each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents ,
Bro015_139	Um . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Huh .
Btr002_3157	Yeah ? ; you know ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_635	Well , if you talk less it does in fact use less me d m data . ; Yeah . ; So , the channels ; Yeah .
Buw001_1882	So that that that would be a source of text which is supposedly got the right vocabulary . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But it 's obviously very different material .
Bsr001_1244	may be giving us , ; uh - huh . ; Um , ; and so if we if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings .
Bmr009_1287	But I Cuz I really don't know . ; W This is just a small thing ; but um It says " Variety " and then it gives things that e have American as one of the choices . ; But then it says " Region " ,
Bro003_200	the feature dimension , the training data dimension , and the test data dimension . ; Um . ; Well , what we want to do is first we have number for each uh task . ; So we have the um , TI - digit task , the Italian task , the French task and the Finnish task .
Bmr031_1276	um for these experiments for the , um , uh for this prosody workshop , ; um , we just , um we just had a phone call with Mari and her students , in fact , ; and they want to , um , e m They 're bringing up their own meeting recognizer , ; which is based on Bill Byrne 's , uh , recognizer from Johns Hopkins .
Bed002_1274	and then for these certain tasks , ; and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , ; it all all of a sudden it does much better . ; Nuh ?
Bmr027_916	It 's just ; yeah ; that we just happened to have a bunch all at once . ; Well , that 's a good idea .
Bro019_263	Mm - hmm . ; they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically . ; So which can cause you to lose time , ; right ?
Bed014_680	I mean this this function , ; so , has the current object been mentioned in in with a question about concerning its ; No , no . It 's it It goes the other d it goes in the other direction . ; Is
Bed004_246	So that 's great . ; Um And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful . ; Mmm . ; And , uh she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm ,
Bed006_639	But in English , that 's not really a problem , ; Mm - hmm . ; unless we get some some topical German movies that have just come out and that are in their database . ; Right .
Bmr010_232	Yeah . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . But then there 's another thing that also Thilo 's involved with ,
Btr001_1652	And s ; Yeah , ; Yeah , it 's true . ; Yeah .
Bed006_380	I would go shopping " . ; Yeah ? ; Mm - hmm . ; and then we can sort of this s instructor can say " well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here
Bro018_215	Fif - fifty - six percent accurate for v voice - unvoice ; Mm - hmm . ; No for , ; yes f
Bmr019_778	We it 's straightforward to actually just have a a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it . ; But , um , we just didn't have time to play with , you know , tuning yet another yet another parameter . ; The ve level . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_491	So there 's what ; thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? ; So - so So maybe there 's a hundred gig or something . ; Or
Bmr009_892	Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one . ; This is the digit form . ; Oh . ; Oh you 're talking about the digit form .
Bsr001_1298	Mm - hmm . ; Try to try to constrain them ; or not constrain them . ; Or try try to figure that out .
Bed008_1156	Yeah . ; This and also , I mean , the other places where , ; like for example consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift ; Right .
Bed006_1180	uh ; it 's it 's it 's flexible . ; Um , the uh ; Well , it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema
Bed008_974	Right . ; OK , so anyway , so that 's another decision . ; Uh what 's what 's another decision you like ? ; OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter .
Bns001_81	I believe we still haven't left our starting position . ; And , um , yesterday I also discussed with Wilbert some things ; and I would like to focus on the question " What problem we are going to solve with such a proposal . " ; Not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside ,
Bro024_268	I mean , usually you have in the training set you have similar conditions , ; I mean , file lengths are , I guess the same order or in the same size as for test data , or ; aren't they ? ; OK .
Btr001_2336	Do you Have you run across this ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro008_333	I mean , it 's it 's , uh , um ; So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh ; And and a and and also , um part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , um a realistic almost realistic database . ; I mean , it 's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something ,
Bed002_191	It 'll just be sitting here . ; Input ? ; Yeah . ; There we go .
Bmr018_1310	Oh , that 's right . ; Yep . ; Right . ; and and and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really there 's really two recording systems .
Bsr001_1325	It is exactly these things that I mentioned . ; Yeah . ; This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in . ; Very interesting .
Bro003_2075	or ? ; No , ; it 's actually sigmoid - X ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1113	It 'd be pretty simple , yeah . ; Yeah . ; But - We went back to that . ; Yeah .
Bed009_993	Great . ; So you 're going to that . ; Yeah , that that 's what we were planning to do . ; That 's good , because that will uh tell you a fair amount about The form of semantic construction grammar that we 're using .
Bmr006_1372	That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . Yeah .
Bmr002_396	Oh , OK . ; But but then there 's the question of the ergonomic interface , that ; I kn ; Oh , I actually have some foot pedals for the P C .
Bed005_355	uh , um ; Is this where it is ? ; This is already the XML stuff ? ; This is where it takes its own , um , syntax ,
Btr001_1183	It 's not gonna be birthday cake , ; so . ; Yeah , so we 'll survive . ; Yeah .
Bns002_232	The value of this radius is uh in principle , is a fixed value ; and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter . ; Of course , uh this is only our uh simplife simplified model ; and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot ,
Bmr010_424	Right . ; you know , a single channel , ; separable , uh , cleanly , easily separable , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_68	And so the other thing I sh she wanted to display the stylized F zeroes , I think they 're called ? ; Is that right ? ; Yeah . The linear fit . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_424	five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , ; but five over ten is is big . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2654	Like , you know , candy bars or something , ; or or or or or a little , uh you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist . ; I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time . ; Mmm !
Bro012_1159	uh d ; So I think that it it would be good ; Yeah , yeah , ; well , go go on .
Bmr031_326	Right . ; It 's just connecting with them . ; So . ; Um . So , then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they 'll they 'll have training sets and test sets ,
Bro008_401	is that even , say on the development set stuff that we saw , the , uh , the numbers that , uh , that Alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers , it was just you know , it wasn't good enough for for a a for a real system . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; You you
Bmr002_671	We can hear all your conversations along the way . ; Yeah , so be just ; I 'll try not to say , " So , Oh dear , Boy ! That 's itching there ! " ; Yeah , don't talk to yourself too much .
Bns001_1219	and That is it . ; I want to focus on it . ; Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this . ; That you can use it with every application
Bro023_436	and , uh , thirteen point seven . ; OK . ; Yep . ; OK .
Btr002_1458	I didn't know about that . ; I don't know . ; Really ? ; Not second by second ,
Bro027_758	Yeah . ; but , uh ; Uh , ; I mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better ,
Bmr003_1238	OK . ; You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave . ; Oh , ; See ?
Bmr015_1014	which would be the ideal situation , ; cuz ; I don't know think it 'd be ideal . ; Uh - uh .
Bro014_62	The first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven . ; And what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , HMM re - estimation is run . ; It 's this program called H E ; But in HTK , what 's the difference between , uh , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ?
Bmr019_1911	And you laughed at me , too , f the first time I said that . ; Right . ; OK . ; Oops .
Bro021_1083	And here we can multiply by X . ; Alright . ; I think these things are a lot clearer when you can use fonts different fonts there ; Oh , yes .
Bmr003_591	is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take , ; and then also what tools we would use . ; And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ? ; And so you make Jane do the first one
Bro011_191	Let 's let 's , I mean , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise ; Mm - hmm . ; in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about ; and that 's probably the best thing to do .
Bed002_1272	Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , ; and we plug it in , ; and then for these certain tasks , ; and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system ,
Bed003_548	I want to get to the church quickly , ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh ; Yeah ,
Bro011_127	We discussed about good things to do ; also uh well , generally good stuff to do for the research . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS ,
Bro017_246	Mm - hmm . ; and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you can say " well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency " ,
Bmr009_719	So , it wouldn't be I wasn't planning to label the time marks . ; I can give you my transcription file , ; I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , ; I don't think you need to .
Bro024_1843	and maybe from that . ; I don't know . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because I think that you did some experiments using the two the two LDA filter , clean and noi and noise ,
Bed008_559	As related from the user model . ; Right . ; So let 's let 's actually ; yeah so lin you can link that up to the
Bsr001_677	Right . ; our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link , ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bdb001_685	There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting . ; Suppose you have a word sequence ; and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence . ; f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences .
Bmr008_376	Yeah , If not given we will estimate . ; so maybe you 'll prefer to ; I I think is not ; The the mean of the estimates from the group will be used
Bed010_720	and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . ; But here 's the the amazing result , um , they say . ; You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . ; So the s typical task is subdivision .
Bmr027_1216	That 'd be a good idea . ; W uh , could you email out the brand ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , sure . Yeah . OK .
Bmr026_310	Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics ; It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr030_607	Really ! ; I should look that up again . ; Y can you send them huge audio files ? ; Mmm . Mmm .
Bro024_1842	the code book ; and maybe from that . ; I don't know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_376	Yes . That 's true . ; So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_152	bu uh , I don't think it 's probably in the original file . ; Um , but , uh ; I recognize that , too . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1568	So ; Right , right . ; Well , I 'll check on that . ; Yeah .
Bro023_596	And Yeah , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real VAD . ; Yeah , our neural net ; So with without cheating like this . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed006_1335	I 'm just telling you what I think , ; you just hit the button and it 's like ; And , I guess fr uh ; Yeah I mean but there 's a good question here .
Bmr011_1577	That 's ; I was thinking , knowing the , uh , n National Institute of Standards , it is all ; I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on ; this was in Wall Street Journal days or something ,
Bed015_1327	The the within the event it 's st it 's still one world . ; Um . ; Yeah , so " cause " and ; Other frames that could come in I mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , " desire " or something like that ,
Buw001_1368	The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now ; Uh - huh . ; and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_880	Situation Go - there , ; I mean , because it 's whether it 's open or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , good .
Bro023_1375	Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative ; because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something . ; s ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1451	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; right ? ; And you 're going through them all .
Bns001_1313	And if Siemens say " OK , great , we will support it " , ; and and what it ; mmm University of Berlin or something ; and maybe University of Mannheim or Duisburg
Bed003_909	Well that 's fine , ; but we have to see the function now . ; Has it become all point fives or not ? ; Oh , right .
Bro027_1294	and " Street " isn't ; Or " Train station " . ; " Train station " , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1846	" vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . " ; That 's great . ; It 's this , " rrre - rrre - rrre " . ; It was me .
Bmr003_1735	cuz it 's the speakers the same . ; And then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker , uh , con continuation . ; Mmm . ; Oh .
Bro023_1104	s ; They have like ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah ,
Bed009_495	Mm - hmm . ; But um the internal workings of of the ; whether you know there 're dialogue action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata . ; So that shouldn't really matter too much .
Bmr019_1976	Or or just same digits . ; So they would all be ; See if anyone notices . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1197	Um . Yeah , and so those are the the two directions that I 'm I 'm looking into right now . ; And , uh , um Yeah . ; I guess that 's that 's it . ; OK .
Bed002_93	Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? " , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the " Jerry "s . ; Yeah . ; Sure . ; Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .
Bro027_1259	Close mike training ; Well ; The most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing . ; Right .
Bmr030_740	No . ; Darn . ; No . ; Nnn .
Btr001_938	So i you know , " OK " is a very e easy example . ; Mm - hmm . ; A person says , " Mm - kay " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_523	And I and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's if there 's any get his input on it . ; I don't think I don't think that 'll be ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_110	how long we go and how good the snack is out there . ; Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence . ; But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical . ; Right .
Bmr001_650	So , can we do we do another set ? ; Sure . ; Are we are we are we sort of ; Sure .
Bmr020_1109	Um ; Yeah and hopefully the new meetings which will start from the channelized version will will have better time boundaries and alignments . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bns001_1785	And I try to motivate the people . ; That it 's free . ; That 's a starting . ; That 's a ramp .
Bdb001_718	So you would be able to go in and say , you know , " give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase ; and give me all the words in the " ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1257	but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can , for these little phonetic categories , ; Mm - hmm . ; You could say it 's sort of built in . ; It 's
Bmr015_191	that 's the only thought I have ; because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr ; She 's trying to get at natural groupings , ; Right .
Bmr023_669	Yeah . There 's all these things to do . ; but it 's s ; Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . ; Yeah .
Bns002_937	Yeah , pero e ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; uh but ; Oh , sorry !
Bed005_818	er , just pick pick any of them ; and just do the eh ; Mm - hmm . ; So I don't I don't think , uh , it 's at all difficult Uh , to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time ,
Bro012_1375	Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ? ; Mmm . ; Yeah , but but B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing . ; Just any i in in each in each frame
Bmr016_1524	but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them ; o ; cuz it 's the only place where where they 're used . ; How about question mark ?
Bmr016_1653	So th ; Yep . ; On the page two of acronyms . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1443	Yeah . ; Based on training data , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro018_1014	Could be . ; You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a ; So I started going through and looking ; One of the things that I did notice was that the um log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the PLP data were much lower , much smaller ,
Bmr016_1556	If you hear CTPD , I mean , they do pretty well ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's
Bro010_641	that 's hard to do . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise .
Bro003_1795	And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , ; uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . ; So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , ; take a while to develop .
Bed008_1553	Yeah . ; OK . ; Touche . ; Good enough .
Bro011_304	and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So they would like clean channels .
Bro018_839	Yeah . ; um ; Yeah , that makes sense , to check all that . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_371	um ; Yeah , ; and who cares ? ; And and there were lots of of course the " uh uh " - s , " in on " - s " of uh " - s .
Bmr028_546	Yeah . ; A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ? ; Yep . ; But two s
Bed013_112	Mmm , I don't know . ; e I 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , ; you know , I mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . Right ? ; I mean
Bmr020_1351	And it just You know , there 's a little interface which will for all the " yes " - es it then that will be the final beep file . ; Yeah . ; Blech . ; That 's interesting !
Bro014_1487	Yeah , well . ; Because ; You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime , ; and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too .
Bmr007_1317	Because , uh well , I mean once his his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way . ; If it works well enough . ; Right now it 's not . Not quite to the point where it works . ; OK .
Bro024_1461	mm - hmm . ; I 'm sorry . ; So when you say minus twenty - five or minus thirty DB , with respect to what ? ; To the average um , speech energy
Bmr012_670	I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted
Bed008_106	everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . ; We should be be clear . ; But when it comes to sort of writing down ; when you when you do these things
Bmr019_1218	Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also ; And ; because even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ? ; You have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition .
Bmr020_477	Somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground ? ; Yes . ; Uh , so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences . ; Yeah .
Bro022_74	So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper ; and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time ; and ? ; Right , right .
Bmr018_1318	but they 've got some empty channels there , ; and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that . ; Right . ; Yeah , it is a good idea .
Bed009_108	Also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code . ; Yes . ; and we can d ; I dunno
Btr001_648	Hmm . ; I don't know . ; I don't know if that 's actually true ; but I 'm just throwing that out there .
Bns002_374	and you send afterwards the data . ; But the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always be assured to be uh s uh uh RTS and CTS packets are changed before before you can forewarning the data , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr021_337	Yeah , it is kind of a temporary solution . ; To shorten everything . ; well , actually , the th what you do is you run ; Oh , now I have another use for the
Bmr016_1997	and you get rid of anything that was read . ; yeah . ; So there wouldn't be something like ; OK .
Bmr003_1214	Good point . ; And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress , ; they 're not gonna re provide repairs , ; they 're not gonna provide
Bro016_438	not no more , anyway . ; Um . ; But you ma you may really wanna add other things later anyway ; Yeah .
Bed006_799	we 'll fill those in fill those roles in , ; OK . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bns001_89	OK , ; thank you Joe . ; So , please . ; Well , I , uh , as all of you know I came from from Spain ,
Bmr009_699	Yep . ; But , anyway We we 'll have to look at some core things . ; Um . ; OK .
Bmr006_1650	You know ; Uh - huh . ; You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1128	that big now . ; That 's right . ; And it really changed a lot ; Yeah .
Bro024_456	Yes . ; I , um I 'm I 'm gonna do some . ; Would you be interested ? ; Sure .
Bed006_358	OK . ; OK . ; Because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , or as much as they can , of that phrasing . ; Hmm .
Bmr018_1596	It was Liz . ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better ,
Bro003_1731	But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional ; Uh , ; that 's a good thing you remove the mike . ; Go ahead ,
Bmr019_796	so ; And you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech . ; I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_317	when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway . ; Right , ; That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part . ; and that 's what I 'm not sure about .
Bmr001_416	Yeah . ; So , hang on ; so that would OK ; I came out at the gig an hour , at one point .
Bro012_638	Hmm ? ; When 's the deadline ? ; I think it 's the thirteenth of May . ; That 's great !
Bmr018_91	Next weekend , week from ; Next weekend ? ; That is right . ; Sorry , not not not the days coming up , but
Bsr001_789	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Always @ @ . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr005_772	Yeah , I just ; the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , ; and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , ; Right .
Bed011_408	Roughly . ; Well , I guess . ; I 'm not sure how long it 's actually going to take . ; The reading task is a lot shorter .
Bmr010_1539	Eee it 's in there somewhere probably . ; But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? ; Eh , I mean , the , uh the , uh the BIC criterion , ; the the t to train the the Gaussian ,
Bro010_475	yep . ; and ; I mean , if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain ; but but , uh , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain
Bmr003_1566	You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case . ; No . ; Oh . ; I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other .
Bed002_1287	which is what they do now . ; And we even had to take out a bit . ; Nancy , you missed that part . ; We had to take out a bit of the road work .
Bmr018_646	Hmm ! ; which which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for for it . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1765	Oh . ; and um and also ; So , description , having the word d term " description " in there is wonderful , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1053	It doesn't include me at all . ; Uh . ; j Just seems like ; Yeah , I mean I don't know if we 'd be able to do any thing f to help STP type problems .
Btr002_1219	Becau ; I don mmm , I don't remember which ones , ; but I think it was maybe ; well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason .
Bro011_505	So ; OK . ; then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . ; I see .
Bro012_905	And ; Yeah , but here ; Yeah . ; You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech ,
Bro016_1049	Can you give an example of an event ? ; Yeah . ; Sure . ; Um , I I can give you an example of twenty - odd events .
Bed003_1731	Uh - huh . ; Sort of having an actively antagonistic , uh ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_50	I liked that one . ; Yeah . ; What is meet meeting maps ? ; Mapping meetings , or ?
Bed008_1041	you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ? ; OK . ; Yeah . ; But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ?
Bed011_348	Yeah , Yeah . ; I um I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them . ; Yeah . ; But yeah , yeah I noticed that , too .
Bed012_7	Eva , Bhaskara , and I did . ; Did you add more stuff to it ? later ? ; Um . Why ? ; Um . I don't know .
Bmr006_283	Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . ; Um . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1191	Right ? ; So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours . ; I mean , is there Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci ; I mean , that are less
Bed006_1164	yeah . ; It 's like ; I have a question about the slot of the SPG action . ; So the Enter - View - Approach the the the EVA um , those are fixed slots in this particular action .
Bed015_1163	And just a note , ; which was that , um ; s so when we actually ha ; so for instance , um ,
Bmr006_838	Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So , this is this is a subset .
Bmr025_626	So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , ; Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2645	Yes , you run across that . ; Let 's see , ; I guess it would be ; it 's up there .
Bmr028_856	But there 's a whole interesting discussion , ; cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either , ; Oh . ; and so um . In fact , we actually don't have a a p
Bmr027_865	Are , um ; Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty ; and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . ; But why shouldn't they just email back ?
Bmr030_479	they 've given us , uh , I think , two full , uh , transcripts . ; They have a third one ; and Brian just sent me a note saying " oh , that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr of the eh transcriptionists ' , uh , s company " . ; Mmm .
Bro022_330	Huh . ; I don't know . ; If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . ; And then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder .
Bed009_666	I totally agree . ; and and ; But but what it nee ; but th what the point is the
Bmr024_1456	So we compute , ; um ; So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . ; And and then we train from scratch .
Bro014_751	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And so ; So it 's better than the system that we had before .
Bro016_758	Um . ; You always have to look at how this uh , these adjustments , uh , affect things . ; And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features . ; So if it if in fact , uh
Bro017_837	Yeah . ; That you would ; Which ; Well , yeah , but we have several means .
Bmr014_474	Right . ; I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that . ; Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , ; and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the you know , uh enumerated , or i
Btr001_2367	yeah , ; Yeah . ; kinda like " Uh . " ; You know .
Bmr019_1936	Oh , you haven't ! ; I 'm not we we Oh , and you haven't done this either . ; OK . ; Oh , OK .
Bsr001_1168	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; It 's so funny , like we close the door and it 's ; Normally a note taker would know not to do that .
Bmr003_840	Yeah . ; It 's just a matter of a very c clear ; it 's XML , isn't it ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_143	Well , w w We d The first we did is we we tried to to do change the the " laufen " into " run " , or " running " , or " runs " . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we noticed that whatever we tried to do , it no effect .
Bmr024_1273	But there 's ; It looks like there will still be some difference , ; maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females . ; Huh .
Bro010_1097	Yeah . ; We don't understand anything in this meeting . ; Yeah , ; so that 's
Bmr026_98	Mm - hmm , yeah I will . ; I ; That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages ; and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll
Bmr016_1220	That 's fine . ; Well Don has a script . ; but they have the gloss . ; Yeah .
Bro025_47	Well , the results are similar . ; Yeah . I mean , it 's it 's actually , uh , very similar . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , if you look at databases ,
Bmr014_254	Well , it could ; if they do a lot of it , it 's ; I mean i it 's just their repair shop . ; Right ?
Bmr003_2496	Who knows , they might have an extra hardware s ; I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bed015_220	but i I mean , I kind of like " meaning " better than " semantic " ; Or ; Oh , whatever . ; but I think there 's vestiges of other people 's biases .
Bro003_913	Mm - hmm . ; and then your testing corpus ? ; Um , the testing corporas are , um , just , um , the same ones as Aurora testing . ; And , that includes , um , the English Spa - um , Italian . Finnish .
Bmr006_1790	Uh . ; But if you release both ; But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . ; She
Bro027_1518	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , ; Yeah .
Bmr014_743	Go ahead . ; I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . ; Yeah . ; I guess
Bro023_180	And they are , like , pretty short . ; Pretty short . ; Shor ; Yeah ,
Bmr022_863	Oh , to get r to get rid of the wired things . ; So we could ; Yep . ; Yes , absolutely .
Bmr011_19	Does everyone has everyone met Don ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah .
Bmr009_818	Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and , ; excuse me , ; the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand . ; If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time .
Bed005_83	OK ? ; Now that , we had to be included for this other one ; which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_293	I 'm gonna work on that today and tomorrow . ; OK . No need to do it today or tomorrow even . ; Do it next week or ; I 'm gonna finish it today , uh hopefully .
Buw001_407	But it 's not ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know how to do it if until you have a system . ; The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then .
Bed016_937	You mean " the steak wants to pay " ? ; N no not that one , ; that 's that 's a the sort of background . ; This is the t uh , page five .
Bro024_928	Or or F F ; one or the other . ; But but they do not apply filtering of the log energy or what ; Like , uh I mean
Bdb001_1282	Exactly . ; And so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that you know , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr031_107	Can you ? ; You 're b you 're B ? ; Test . ; What am I ?
Bmr019_1353	There 's a special Aurora session ; and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May or something to turn in their paper . ; Oh . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1262	Yeah . ; Yeah , six dollars an hour . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I see .
Bed005_909	there 's this , eh , uh ; Robert was describing ; the There 's two packages ; there 's a , uh , quote parser ,
Btr001_591	Huh . ; Euh . ; No . ; And f
Bns003_672	So , that 's my future uh forecast . ; Mm - hmm , ; and , uh , do you have some students which could be join if there is ; Yeah .
Bro004_313	Both training and test ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Um
Bmr028_1592	I I , uh I appreciate the discussion . ; I wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter , ; which is with respect to , um , this thing that you 've been r working on for the recording monitoring script ? ; So . The idea You had this script that you 're working on , to be sure that the microphone values are in are kept in ?
Btr002_695	Huh . ; Painful . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1630	Mm - hmm . ; You 're getting something that is is uh , af strongly affected by the PLP model . ; And so it 's more psycho - acoustic . ; So it 's a little It 's It 's It 's sort of sort of a different thing .
Bmr016_884	so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything . ; OK . ; We can downsample them , ; Do you think that 'd be OK ?
Bmr021_57	Yeah . Yeah , definitely . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_375	But it seems to me that really doesn't matter . ; If they have the disk space to do it , it seems that that is not a big deal . ; I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion about mismatched rates . ; Well , it 's just if that they 're sending it to us , then we have to have the disk space to do it too .
Bro016_991	Have to do So you you have to do two returns ? ; Mmm . W uh , for two thousand I did . ; Yeah . ; Oh , oh .
Bmr007_363	uh ; depends what you 're doing , ; if Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . ; Mm - hmm ?
Bro024_1212	Yeah . ; There first , a threshold on the probability @ @ That puts all the values to zero or one . ; Mmm . ; And then the median filtering .
Bed014_1240	but ; Good . ; Uh , no , all the focus stuff . ; We sort of just dropped that
Buw001_1359	Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that . ; By so by going around ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed004_241	this is the information on on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up , ; and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better . ; Oh , yeah , ; and then of course as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ .
Bmr009_1021	but New England has a bunch of very different dialects ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; and so does um S So do other places .
Bro023_1198	I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_787	and when there is no on - line normalization . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; There is just some filtering with the LDA
Bro018_916	And what it does is it it copies ; The the filters ? ; Which filters ? ; um
Bmr026_656	um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting ; and between you know , whoever 's interested in that
Bed015_909	not Nancy . " ; Hmm . ; So that 's focuses on John . ; Right .
Bed003_1468	I think it has to exist somewhere . ; Yeah ; but I don't know if it 's still ; They might have blown it up .
Bmr025_904	Yeah . ; where like one one button was " uh - oh " ; Yeah . ; and then another button was " that 's great "
Bed015_269	OK , so that all looks good . ; Let me ; Oh , w Oh . ; I don't know .
Bro007_519	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , ; maybe . ; In which case ; so I I uh well we should look
Bro024_383	so I should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frames ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr011_1248	um , and uh , ; That 's nice . ; I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to ; Acoustic features versus psychological categories .
Bns002_230	and uh in the simpler way , we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius . ; OK ? ; The value of this radius is uh in principle , is a fixed value ; and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter .
Bns002_1257	Yeah , but nevertheless , you have the range of ten meters , or of one hundred meters . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but you know , uh in fact ; OK .
Bsr001_1767	Then the recording is easy ; and maybe maybe they ; Yeah , recording is ; Right .
Bed010_576	Mm - hmm . ; I don't think it it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different . ; Um , as a matter of fact ; No , it 's not .
Bmr022_22	Um So , ; only a couple of agenda items , since no one sent me email for agenda items . ; Uh , the first is the IBM transcripts . I 'd like to uh , mention ; I s I spoke with several of you about this ,
Bro028_51	Yeah . But that 's ; Yeah . ; That 's not a problem , I I guess . ; OK .
Bro005_577	Scale ; Variances . ; Yeah . ; But
Bmr031_1659	And now we 're understanding trying to understand what those are . ; It - it 's it 's it 's fun . ; Do you want to add some anything ? to say anything ? ; She just got back .
Bed015_170	Mm - hmm . ; s For sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use
Bed012_103	So so we get this whole list of of , um , things , ; and the question is what to do with it , ; what to hand on , ; how to interpret it ,
Bro021_863	the top equation is is is ; No , this in the it 's this is the log domain . ; I I must to say that . ; Which is which is the log domain ?
Bro012_135	You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are . ; Right . Well , that 's why I saying ; I 'm just kidding . ; either Well , either spectrum or cepstrum
Btr002_1405	Mmm . ; Oh yes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro010_994	It it was in that sense an unfair test . ; Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , uh , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , ; these smooth envelopes . ; And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , uh , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not .
Bed015_2233	Yeah , it 's fine . ; Fine . ; Four ? ; Yeah
Bro005_245	Yeah . ; eighty - nine point seven . ; OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition ; Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping .
Bns002_1491	Um ; yeah ; I will distribute all the things electronically ; OK .
Bmr022_496	But yeah , if they recycle through ; Well ; Yeah , if we if we did mod ten , then ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1005	Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask , to talk about this ; Everybody speaks Hebrew . ; Really ? ; but it just seems to me that that doesn't the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking .
Bmr019_422	Well . ; OK . ; Yeah . This would be OK . ; We we we think that this has spikes on it ,
Bed013_1379	So th this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper as saying , " you know people look at kinds of at ambiguities " , ; and um , ; in the literature there 's " bank " ; and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon .
Bro017_605	That has no effect ? ; Um . ; Eh Is this in the baseline ? ; or in uh
Btr001_936	how it 's pronounced . ; Uh - huh . ; So i you know , " OK " is a very e easy example . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1777	So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh , simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks . ; A simultaneous digit . OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hey , I 've never done one of those .
Bro011_432	I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , ; whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know , linguistics students , ; this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_741	but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different . ; The picture I have in mind concerning UMTS is , first of all , if you use UMTS only for voice , Like you did it or are doing now for GSM , it 's not worth to have this kind of network . ; And , currently in Europe , where it will be deployed first , I believe , it will be very hard , in principle , to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice . ; Voice ,
Bro023_1070	Mm - hmm . ; And finally , uh , sixteen point five . ; And this is , um , spectral subtraction plus what ? ; Plus plus nonlinear smoothing .
Bmr028_604	Well , yeah . Y you do , becau ; You 're gonna Yeah , you 're gonna hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context . ; But you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech , or , uh , y noise , or whatever . ; I I 'm not too afraid ab about that as
Bmr020_936	Like when we went t to ; um ; When I was listening to the original file that Adam had , it 's like you you hear a word then you hear a beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence . ; That 's on the other channel .
Bro022_393	I 'm sorry , ; all that stuff . ; was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ? ; It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits .
Bed013_447	Yeah , it is . ; Shoot . ; OK . ; Alright , you guys can continue talking about whatever you were talking about before .
Bmr005_507	So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here ; Yeah . ; I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3286	I 'm glad to hear that . ; Yeah . ; I st I didn't do that systematically until , uh , really rather recently , ; Yeah .
Bro008_487	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; Yeah . ; So this would be the first thing ,
Bed015_554	Uh , um , and so ; Correct . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know where that sits then ,
Bmr026_51	Um and we want it You know , we need ; The Again , we we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich ; and get it transcribed and get it back . ; Right .
Btr002_97	" Ish decay " . ; Now " ish " was in parentheses ; " Ish decay . " ; Yeah , what 's an " ish " ?
Bsr001_1290	I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on " ; or ? ; Well , ; so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do
Bmr009_627	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel . ; I I me I I understand .
Bed016_912	But the other is , ; uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , ; or , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_121	We w um ; The guy . ; OK , so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech . ; No .
Bmr002_1285	well , see in my pilot stuff , ; so in the half hour or so that I 'm doing . I 'd just as soon put it in , ; because I do think that you 'd find that those would be words ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_170	if sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well . ; So it 'll say it 's nonsense with perfect intonation . ; Are we gonna Can we change the voice of the of the thing , ; because right now the voice sounds like a murderer .
Bmr005_298	Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point . ; Oh . ; Yeah , depends on which one you mean . ; And I don't I don't remember which which part .
Bro026_1058	Mm - hmm . ; Or is it cor you know , is it ? ; I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . ; I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard .
Bro003_1632	We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott , ; um , ; uh , but we I would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro022_177	first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , ; and so HTK wasn't . ; Um , ; so this ,
Btr002_870	or even forward , ; I 'll use the mouse , ; the middle ; How do you mean " expand " ?
Bro003_1054	Uh , I don't think so . ; There 's a computation limit , though , ; isn't there ? ; Yeah ,
Bed009_830	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm , yeah . ; And they 're doing chunk parsing ; and it 's uh
Bro023_18	So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing ; Cool . ; Mm - hmm . ; and give us his his thoughts .
Btr001_488	Yeah , ; cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish .
Btr002_1782	Yeah . ; it was like it 's like , ; y y you know , ; someone in one of these EDU meetings , they have a laptop
Bmr016_1067	So we just ; If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive ; and make it all scratch space . ; You know , it 's not a big deal .
Bsr001_1740	So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money .
Bro012_655	Well , I 'm going to be out next week ; but I could try to look into like this uh CVS over the web . ; That seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and over , you know , multiple sites and things ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_524	and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , " well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike " , ; but um in in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of " where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree " . ; Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , " there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river " , or something like that . ; So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on .
Bro022_70	D - Day . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr010_342	And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian 's thing ? ; I sent it to , ; um ; who did I send that to ?
Bed005_1367	For example , whether ; OK . So , th it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world . ; Let 's assume there are only twenty object types in this world . ; And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings .
Bed016_998	Um . ; Hmm . ; So you know it 's ; you you can sometimes use " where " f for " when "
Bro019_1263	Yeah , d ; part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not . ; Yeah . ; Uh , so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline
Bro005_591	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; do ? ; So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features .
Bmr005_782	or how bad it is , ; Well ; I 'm working on a program to do that , and ; be um , because that would be interesting
Bmr023_156	Um , it seems It looks l I haven't The It 's The experiment is still not complete , ; but , ; um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1664	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is ; But I I didn't export anything out of it
Bro010_1177	and , um , feed that through the i um , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's also this , uh , um , uh , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing ,
Bed013_367	That 's what that paper was , ; " here 's here 's one possible thing you could do " , ; Mm - hmm . ; short ,
Bmr003_390	Yeah . ; Yep . ; And I don't know exactly how they recorded it ; but apparently there 's a lot of different styles of speech and what not .
Bmr026_478	So . ; It 's ; Yeah . ; One point five or something .
Bro028_401	And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in . ; So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , ; and see does that is that does that make the difference ? ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_813	The what what my sort of sentiment is they 're ; Well , I I once had to write a a a a charter , a carter for a a student organization . ; And they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be . ; And I looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it 's not a
Bed005_212	Which films are showing ? ; Are pl playing at the cinema ? ; playing ? ; Yeah .
Bed017_507	So " this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux " or something like this . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . So something something very specific that you can then ; But the I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries .
Bro008_311	Actually , there is one thing that well Um , generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes , ; and ; so I think it could be interesting to to see if it I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , ; and so we have I I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech .
Bmr009_214	did did you have this sort of thing , for just the just the l r uh the the unnormalized log energy ? ; OK . Yeah . ; So she she 's right . ; but it 's the it 's the the the following .
Bmr030_751	We must be doing it on D F . ; No , it 's D E . ; D E , I think , ; D E 's not full .
Bmr008_1662	And so I mean coming back to Jose 's question , ; I mean there 's still this issue of of of how much time ; I mean ; What do you look at in order to normalize ?
Buw001_1515	we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . ; Yeah . ; And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , ; Yeah .
Bed010_606	but ; But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was this was a a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . ; So uh . ; I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .
Btr002_841	That 's true . ; I think that would be useful . ; Hmm . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_611	So each thing refers to the utterance that it belongs to . ; Right . ; So it 's it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . ; And then each utterance could refer to a turn ,
Btr002_1114	OK , let 's do it that way . ; Mm - hmm . ; So so if we if we have a map of the room , the one when you first walk in ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_242	Hmm ? ; Cuz then you have , you know , more and more , u chances to get away from random errors . ; And I think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , ; and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done ,
Bmr028_1436	we 're ; or ; Shoot . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_836	if Thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out ; because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word . ; But , um , you know , if there are things ; Two words .
Bed004_802	That 's right . ; Uh , ; I 'm just saying that I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this . ; I just at the moment don't know .
Bns002_658	at least for the moment , ; maybe later we 'll see some differences . ; So ; You know , the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism .
Bmr003_1283	What s so what are you so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . ; Yes . ; And what 's your plan ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_148	Mm - hmm . ; How how is how good is that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I don't have a sense of
Bmr006_148	I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that ; Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents . ; u The accent 's not the problem . ; Oh , OK .
Bro007_597	It 's uh ; when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell , ; so ; so in some ways he just got his payback ,
Bmr009_1060	Uh - huh . ; But I don't know what it is . ; So . ; Well , you have a like techno - speak accent I think .
Bmr014_430	like cough or like laugh or whatever , ; " NONVOC " for door - slam , ; and " GLOSS " for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . ; Right .
Bed012_890	Wait , ; maybe it 's OK , so that that that we can that we have one node per construction . ; Cuz even in people , like , they don't know what you 're talking about if you 're using some sort of strange construction . ; Yeah , they would still c sort of get the closest , best fit .
Bmr006_730	Yeah , acoustic with this . With with , yeah , the background . ; Yeah , fans . ; This is like a ground level , with It 's not it 's not total silence . ; Eh , I I mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh ,
Bro010_1197	Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . ; Uh , ; I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do ; But .
Bmr026_836	Cool . ; And then we had some results on digits , uh , with um ; We We ; So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .
Bmr027_501	I remember that . ; But , um , the attorneys , I uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with ; and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , ; but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact O K 'd it .
Bro027_1020	yeah , maybe we can add some context from these features also as Dan did in in his last work . ; Could . ; i ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_1756	Right , but , uh , in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background , ; cuz that would be too much work . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Bmr019_630	Oh , OK . ; So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . ; Um . ; Just sort of t to make sure that we can do that
Bmr028_243	And then still do it ahead of time , ; but then at least you 're covered if if , uh if there 's a problem . ; Yeah , if there are any problems . ; Right .
Bmr005_1491	Turning off the microphone made it crash . ; Well ; That 's good to know . ; OK .
Bsr001_2082	but SRI in general is is the ; but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue . ; Yeah . ; And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu
Bro012_181	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well . Actually it 's better . ; It seems better when we look at the mismatched case
Bed003_1699	So who would be the subject of this trial run ? ; Pardon me ? ; Who Will there be a Is one Is you one of you gonna be the subject ? ; Like are you
Bed003_842	OK , sh ; explain to me why it 's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public . ; Or , if something ; It seems like it 's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it
Bmr007_460	Right . ; No , I I agree with that . ; That 's all . ; I 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting .
Bed015_974	Yeah , so that was the other thing . ; And so I didn't realize it before . ; It 's like , " oh ! " It was an epiphany that it you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . ; So topic is
Bmr007_310	Yeah . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there .
Bed002_724	the , um ; And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's ; um ; I don't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in .
Bro028_1065	I think that 's that seems , uh that seems like a lot better idea . ; Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features . ; Um , ; so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this artificial question of of , uh , exactly how you how you a how you assess it
Btr001_2457	or ; Yeah . ; Or how long do you wait after the joke ; To keep going with the meeting .
Bed010_1029	S I 'll send you email . ; OK . ; Yeah , ; and so anyway we c uh We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in in uh
Bmr019_1796	Are we gonna do them simultaneously ; Oops . ; get our last bit of , uh , Jose 's Jose Jose 's digit ; or ?
Bmr022_636	Right . The individual segments between the beeps ; Um , if beeps were like the segments that we get from um , the transcription tool already , that that 's what we have done , ; and it works very well . ; You can see these segments align and these don't .
Bro018_459	Uh , completeness in the in the sense that um if we if we pick these X number of acoustic events , do they provide sufficient coverage for the phones that we 're trying to recognize or or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on . ; And so Morgan and I were uh discussing um s uh s a form of a cheating experiment where we get um we have uh um a chosen set of features , or acoustic events , ; and we train up a hybrid um system to do phone recognition on TIMIT . ; So i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , using um these set of acoustic events , then um that that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover a set of phones ,
Bmr013_409	They overlap each other in weird ways . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal .
Bed016_411	No , you shouldn't . ; because because you are on the , uh , title . ; I mean on the the , you 're that 's see , that 's you . ; Oh , that 's great , that 's great .
Bmr015_709	Eh , ; Yeah . ; I haven't enough file feeling to to to distinguish what happened . ; Yeah , I 'd like to talk with you about it .
Bed015_1575	there 's a you know , whatever , it c it could point at one of these . ; I just had a I just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works . ; For what ? ; If it works .
Bed004_619	The harder problem is we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ? ; And that the the that 's the hardest problem . ; So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology . ; The h
Bro016_204	but ; I 've seen that with the mel cepstrum . ; Yeah . ; I don't I don't know about the Aurora front - end ,
Bro014_813	t ; we w basically we are still playing with Matlab to to look at at what happened , ; What sorts of ; Yeah .
Btr002_3080	Yeah , no one 's ever sworn in any of the meetings ! ; Well , y you 've heard have you heard " shoot " ? ; That actually ; I 've heard " shoot " a couple of times .
Bmr003_1106	Yeah . ; Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co Something like that . ; They all just said transcription . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr029_899	um , why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out , ; and I I 'll throw them out , too . ; Right . ; And then we have complete completely identical training conditions .
Bro028_1168	And one of the ideas , um , that was to take a take a neural net ; train train an ordinary neural net to uh , to learn the posterior probabilities of phones . ; And so , ; um , at the end of the day you have this neural net
Bro008_236	So , Hynek will try to push for trying to combine , uh , different things ? ; Or ; Uh , well that 's um ; Hmm ?
Bed009_694	but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh a service is gonna come and describe itself to you . ; and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in in in the DAML uh project where um you you find a GIS about that gives you information on Berkeley , ; Yeah . ; and it 's it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things .
Bmr024_84	Oh , excellent . ; So . ; Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , ; Oh , good .
Btr002_887	Well , I would press " tab " ; I do that with the mouse , yeah . ; and listen to where I wanted it to stop , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_146	Yeah . ; yeah . ; " See how different these sequences of numbers are ? " ; Yeah .
Bed015_1723	Mmm . ; Yeah , I mean ; It 's like I don't totally think ; Yeah .
Bro027_1447	Yeah . ; and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , ; but you also take the path that that doesn't have that , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr022_903	Yeah , but I don't know that one . ; So what 's that mean ? ; This it 's it 's a cell phone jack . ; You can't miss it .
Bed003_1306	Yeah , ; that makes sense . ; Yeah . ; And if it if you do it If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like " So how much has it cost to enter ? "
Bro007_244	or is it most of them longer or ; Yeah ; for the Italian even seven digits y more or less ; Yeah .
Bns002_921	to p l the part of the of the radio frequency power you have to transmit . ; I mean , this is this cannot be avoided . ; But what you can avoid or you can reduce ; and probably
Bmr001_753	And so they they just have to indicate that the speaker changes . ; Right . ; This was this was the point of having near zero skew . ; Right ?
Bmr009_1419	I like that . I like that . ; You like it ? ; OK . ; Yeah , I do .
Btr002_1207	But , um , ; OK . ; That 's good . ; Oh , let me see .
Bmr009_1142	Oh , OK yeah . ; because , you know , then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1499	ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey . ; And we sent in a very poor abstract , ; but they ; very poor ,
Bmr019_638	It 's uh , I mean , the the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly ; but it unfortunately is not designed and , um like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command . ; So , the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , uh , dump out , um ; you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files
Bed004_103	Um . ; There are here are uh the results . ; Mmm . ; And I will not
Bmr022_585	although we can try it . ; Um ; Well , but , all we 'll get ; Well , with the beep models , is what 's really you 'd have really g it would be really good though .
Bed002_144	as well as the close talking mikes . ; What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , ; gives us , um , high quality audio , ; um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus .
Bmr014_1199	Or mail , physical mail . ; Or if for ; leave it on their voice mail . ; Any sub - word level thing .
Bmr001_517	So that would last us for a while . ; Yeah , couple hours ! ; Well , anyway for this this recording we 're fine ; Yeah .
Bmr002_225	So , a short sentence between each line . ; It really sounds like sentences . ; Your intonation sounds like somewhat like sentence intonation . ; Well , you can intone it however you want .
Bro014_993	No . ; Uh , no . ; Oh , ; OK .
Bmr025_1039	We we could . ; Should we do simultaneous ? ; Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1436	Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . ; So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , ; k ; Sure .
Bro023_771	So , ; I mean So this is like the noise compensation f is fixed ; Mm - hmm . ; but you make a better decision on the endpoints .
Bmr025_912	Action item . ; Yeah ; something like that ; or
Bed002_857	you walking through through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe we wanna do that . ; Yeah .
Bns003_383	Yeah , but a at least then it should be mmm , I think be , uh , ICSI part , and not network restricted . ; Right . ; Well , th they have uh , a a white booklet , you know , probably ; Yeah , that is from nineteen ninety - one or nineteen ninety - two , you know . A
Bsr001_697	My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad . ; And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr020_226	and the Robustness meetings were had the least , ; so ; One sort of unexpected result there is that uh two - party telephone conversations have about the same amount of overlap , ; I 'm surprised .
Bmr014_616	Cu - Cube root ? ; Yeah . ; To ; No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the
Bmr024_1521	Yeah . ; Right . ; because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different . ; Right .
Bmr006_795	No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . ; No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying " Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? " ; Eh ; Ah !
Bmr014_404	It 's one token from the from the corpus . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , those are e extremely efficient
Bns002_1315	you will solve it OK ? ; I 'll try to . ; OK , please go on . ; So , let me let me just uh finish , you know .
Btr002_2612	Yes . ; I think we already talked about this last time , ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1975	Oh . ; Oh , well . ; I 'm talking about next week . ; I 'm leaving leaving next Wednesday .
Bns002_1482	And then I will come back maybe in the mid of end of January . ; So that 's uh it 's a comment to the proposal . ; So I think everybody should consider carefully , based on this statement I made uh next steps ; and of course everybody has little bit other work to do
Bed008_1508	Yeah . ; Ah . ; Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in ; I don't
Bed006_1563	Two - th Two - thirty - ish or three or Friday at three or something around that time . ; So do I . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_661	What meetings are we going to record ? ; Us , to begin with . ; So which which meetings What meetings do we have ? ; I think that 's the intention .
Bmr028_81	because when I was looking at it , we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one 's saying anything . ; That 's just background speech . ; Ah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_354	I , uh , ; I ; Your telephone , ; aren't you ?
Bro023_1562	So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate , ; first on SpeechDat - Car ; Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . ; And it 's , uh , slightly worse ,
Bro024_150	And the other thing is , I mean , there 's two sides to these really small , uh , gradations in performance . ; Um , I mean , on the one hand in a practical system if something is , uh , four point four percent error , four point one percent error , people won't really tell be able to tell the difference . ; On the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent . ; So so the they they it 's I don't mean to say that they 're they 're irrelevant .
Bsr001_1039	Hmm . ; So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ? ; Uh , ; I , you know
Bmr021_431	I mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place ; and then operate on it and then delete it . ; But . ; I mean , the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions .
Bmr031_830	I see . ; So . ; We need different color pens , definitely . ; And that I think that that status thing is kinda old actually right now .
Bmr019_1813	Yeah . ; Why is it that I can read your mind ? ; Well , we 've gotta wait until after di after we take the mikes off . ; No , no .
Bmr019_998	but it would be the person who asked the question . ; Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling . ; And , you know , sometimes you have the Yeah , uh - huh . ; Well , that 's interesting .
Bro012_644	Yeah . ; But on meeting digits , maybe there 's ; Maybe . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_821	See , if you also wanna just determine if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , then I think you want to look look at high frequencies also , ; because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced . ; Yeah . ; But , i i uh I mean i i
Bro025_117	figure it out . ; I mean , and th the joke there was that each of them had specialized in one of them . ; And and so they ; Oh , OK .
Bmr021_998	I mean obviously you always ; I mean , there 's never gonna be a signal from all the channels , ; right ? ; because
Bed005_736	and all those things . ; Right . ; Now , we hav the the whole Unfortunately , the whole database is , uh , in German . ; We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it ,
Bmr011_680	Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , ; that you have an infrastructure problem , ; you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , ; and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it .
Bro012_99	Hmm . ; um . So . um ; So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ . ; One of the things I was I mean , I was trying to think about what what 's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts
Bmr019_403	Yeah , I think this contraption around your head is not working so well . ; Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah . ; Anyway , what I was saying is that I I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to . ; That looks good .
Bro012_7	so uh the PDA mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at at uh five hertz ; uh ; where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web ; and and uh I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner .
Bmr028_1012	The other thing is that you actually have direction here . ; Right . ; So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location . ; Speaker ID .
Bro028_987	I mean , he t he tries , um , using just M minus one of them . ; So there are M possible subsets of this length - M vector . ; He tries classifying , using each of the M possible sub - vectors . ; Hmm .
Bro004_296	right ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's band - limited TIMIT .
Bro008_377	Um ; Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone and noisy speech testing , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro010_99	I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr008_468	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; which would be ; Which is more objective . than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that .
Bro018_844	Although really , uh uh , a couple three percent uh difference in word error rate uh could easily come from some difference in normalization , I would think . ; But ; Yeah , ; and I think , hhh I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run sort of the reverse experiment .
Bro017_813	You train it on the original vector . ; But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model , ; and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data . s by the same amount . ; Could you also if you wanted to
Bro021_1058	We have this , ; Right . ; no ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_2622	and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at . ; When ; OK . ; So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air ,
Bmr022_222	Oh . ; See , I should listen . ; Yeah ? ; Hmm .
Bmr002_237	Great . ; So we 'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting . ; just to get some more digits . ; Right .
Bsr001_795	Like ; Yeah . ; As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection . ; Yeah .
Bns002_575	And this guy is behind the wall , so his transmission rate is something like that . ; Yeah but but ; yeah ; but the but in this case , you know this this idea , this uh geometric idea , can be can be , if you want , uh deformed because of some obstacles .
Bed002_880	There 's no ; OK , so it 's just like , " Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances " . ; Yeah , and and we will record both sides . ; I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard
Bmr027_498	Mm - hmm . ; That was the kind of dispute I was making before . ; Mm - hmm . ; I remember that .
Bmr008_1140	Mm - hmm . ; is that what you mean , or ; What what what uh , ; Um , just as an example , it would be , " Source , Adam Janin " , " Destination , Morgan " , " Relationship , Advisor " .
Bed015_71	So I 'll just try to go through them . ; So they could all have a type at the beginning . ; Um , and then they say the key word construction ; Oh , I see .
Bro022_508	and he 's really got something . ; Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? ; Ex - exactly . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_939	Yeah . ; OK . ; yeah . ; And that that 's quick to do .
Bmr006_1088	I now have ten likely candidates . " ; And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1696	Yeah . ; Then I I would need to find a way to like smooth less also when there is high energy . ; Cuz I noticed that it it helps a little bit to s like smooth more during low energy portions and less during speech , ; Yes ,
Bmr018_1297	yep . ; which is the i interesting ; And cameras . ; and video , right .
Bmr007_1039	Could you fill that out anyway ? ; Just , put your name in . ; Are y you want me to do it ? ; I 'll do it .
Bmr016_1049	Well we we have a problem with that , ; you know , time - wise on a ; It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file , ; Hmm .
Bmr011_1077	they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk . ; And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription .
Bro003_1673	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing . ; Good .
Bro008_477	So ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; so d
Bro011_199	right ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; So yeah we 're will start to do this also . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2290	You know , if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half , or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file , that 's not a problem . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1000	I just wanted to get it so tha So that if you have like " yeah " in a swimming in a big bin , then it 's ; No , no ! ; I don ; actually I I
Bmr011_1849	Mm - hmm . ; Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global . ; It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , ; uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word .
Bro016_260	Um , I mean we ca ; it 's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range of these features , it , um , uh , could ; Uh ; Even though it 's it 's it 's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back - end , and it 's ar artificial here that we 're not adjusting those , you certainly don't wanna be adjusting those all the time .
Bro012_994	Um . Uh . Yeah . ; So yeah . ; And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction ; and I think
Bed011_821	and they say " Ah , enough . " ; And the and the this used all over the place . ; Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1379	because we didn't actually advertise openly . ; We a I mean w ; I told I d asked him privately . ; Um , and it is a little bit of a trek for campus folks .
Bmr022_695	And then it will be , you know , this Eve - every now and then there 'll be a a beep missing . ; So , someone 's gonna talk to Brian . ; Yeah , I 'll ; I think that was Chuck .
Bro012_1038	so . ; Uh . yeah . ; We we will try MSG , ; but um ,
Bro014_1179	and this is the difference . ; This is the difference . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr008_161	you know , his XML thing ? ; You got the Data Type Definition the Document Type Definition p part that it 's can s be used for relational things , ; Oh . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr027_1081	cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Um . OK , the next one ,
Buw001_1123	And so that was one suggestion . ; Well , I mean , ; so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? ; I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself ,
Bro017_1166	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; So . ; When Yeah .
Bmr025_711	I mean , I could be taking notes on these things ; and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings ; but ; I don't know .
Bed015_831	If it 's just that thing , ; Or the constituent that it falls in . ; a little bit more or the whole phrase . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_1067	Sure . ; Yeah . ; So that the the trick is going to be t to take this and pick a some sort of lattice of constructions , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_161	So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . ; It 's just for closure . ; So that if we come up with a question of " could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? " or something . ; You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .
Bro026_64	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Actually I I tried wh while when I installed the repository , I tried from Belgium . ; I logged in there and I tried to import
Bmr014_632	Uh , OK , and ; Yeah . ; That 's that 's basically the the the thing . ; OK .
Bed016_570	And it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists . ; So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_768	because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , ; Well , training , and validation . Sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; eh . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically ,
Bro014_1548	and and then figure out if there 's some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process . ; OK . ; OK . ; So that 's
Bed008_1510	Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in ; I don't ; yeah , ; I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here .
Bed004_234	Yeah . ; So I think that 's great . ; This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison , ; Yeah .
Bro026_339	Uh , no I think it 's also institutional , ; Still institutionally second ? ; isn't it ? ; Right ?
Bed003_1182	And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all , then you have " What I learned " , as a slide . ; Can't you have both ? ; You could . ; My first approach failed .
Bmr019_205	Hmm . ; this , you know , very limited training HTK system . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording TI - digits .
Bro022_210	um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . ; And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . ; You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in ; So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .
Bmr012_391	Do you mean so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? ; Maybe we shouldn't say PZM in these meetings . ; Well well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet ; and I mean um anyway there
Bmr028_190	because not everything is displayed in that tree at once . ; Right ? ; Uh , no . ; But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then .
Bmr012_340	OK . ; and that definitely indicra indicates a bug . ; Uh . ; Well that would really be a problem ,
Bmr030_381	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; The idea is that we 're taking less time of the linguists . ; Right .
Bmr023_866	because @ @ they 're essentially the same scale ; Yeah . Why did that cha ? ; but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_682	Right . ; Right . ; you know ? ; But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net .
Bro005_452	Yes . ; Uh - huh . ; Because we have eighty - eight point six . ; And even the MLP alone
Btr001_2166	Hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_691	then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window ; and the then it um then things are l more linear . ; It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved ; and um and you can use channel normalization techniques like
Bro024_1082	Oh . ; So they don't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error . ; Oh , OK . ; So they changed the whole thing so that there 's no delay for that compression and part also .
Bed002_1318	Clear ? ; OK . Sounds good . ; The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone . ; I was wondering .
Bmr031_1265	do you ? ; Anyway . ; Um . ; So while he 's vacationing , um , we 've been , uh
Bro012_804	and And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close ,
Bmr003_1528	the PDA ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; And and so he was in sort of you were sort of talking
Bro022_288	Oh , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio .
Bro005_1008	And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , ; I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , ; but one of the core quote " open questions " for that is um , um , if we take the uh you know , the best ones here , ; maybe not just the best one ,
Bmr009_1451	Yeah . ; OK . ; And it 's easy on the subjects . ; Yep .
Bed003_425	Right . ; So ; Right ? ; Right ,
Bed016_330	So that 's basically what I have , so far , ; and the rest is for airplanes . ; So X - schemas , then , I would like to do ; talk about the construction aspect
Bmr024_1193	That was on males . ; Right . ; That was that was before I tried it on the females . ; Oh .
Bed003_564	Yeah , we could . ; But the demo doesn't work very well . ; No , ; then it wouldn't be a demo
Bns001_436	But when quality of service comes to the uh scene , well , I think we have a a bigger problem ; because maybe this this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all , ; because maybe the the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network , let 's say high - speed networking , cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology . ; So , this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme
Bmr020_1447	but but I I I have another suggestion on that , which is , since , really what this is , is is is trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gonna be this this post - processing step , ; um , ; why don't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_81	I could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , ; so that people in the group know . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro010_219	and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . ; Right . ; We just , uh , you know , trained up systems to be more discriminant . ; And , uh , we did this , uh , RASTA - like filtering
Bed003_1381	Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened . ; so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , ; so as in " No I really don't want to see that movie . ; I 'd rather stay home and watch TV "
Bmr007_325	Mm - hmm . ; Because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing . ; These are simplifying assumptions , ; Yeah .
Bed002_28	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um . So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1236	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you can't get it directly from the transcription . ; Right .
Bdb001_1081	you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that . ; Yeah , I 've seen it . ; So that would be i directly , ; Yep .
Bmr021_16	Who does ? ; I do . ; I do . ; I l I think I find them very comfortable .
Bed015_1413	S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now ; OK . ; and to think that there are , um , ; That comes in
Bed009_418	Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to I think that 's not going to be good enough . ; I I don what uh what I meant by that . ; So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_430	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and ; That would be great , yeah , to know that .
Btr002_3104	Yeah , and I was like , " Oah ! " ; I emailed you , ; I was like , " M You might wanna check this out . " ; That 's right . That 's right .
Bro013_86	Yeah . ; I mean . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . ; We 've been playing a number of states ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_995	Mmm . ; you know , it 's th this is a case where , um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things ; but I I sort of figure that i @ @ that that 's not as far aw away from " OK " as " mm - kay " is , ; so it 's not quite so
Bmr031_1362	So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model for what 's going on is is wrong ; Is it wrong ? ; Right . ; or incomplete ,
Bmr006_105	Uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , I actually feel the opposite need . ; I 'd like to have lots of different people . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro005_91	And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . ; Yes . ; If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's we have one hundred and seventy - two , ; Yeah .
Bmr008_704	not necessarily again , if you 're on the army base or ; Right . ; Well , the way it 's phrased right now , it 's clearly asking about language . ; Yeah .
Bro024_754	So . ; Yes . ; Stephane also has the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right ? ; Mmm .
Bro018_664	Oh it i ; Oh , so it is a sigmoidal . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro012_69	A mike for . uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes ; so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other ; but if we do make use of the cheap mikes , uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it . ; And then again if it 's
Bro003_1415	and they used LabCut to to pass . ; OK , ; yeah . ; Actually that was complicated ,
Bro026_1059	Or is it cor you know , is it ? ; I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones . ; I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard . ; And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .
Bmr026_716	Or just alternate the focus . ; Tha - That 's what I mean . ; Yeah , so on even weeks have basic on data . ; Yeah .
Bed015_2007	So , ; and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway . ; Yeah . So what I would like to do is separate that problem out . ; Inherits .
Bro021_764	Oh , yes . ; Right , right . ; To remove the noise too . ; I think I ask you that every single meeting ,
Bmr031_1073	Great . Great . ; Y y yeah . W we should talk to you off - line about something . ; Well , wait a minute , ; I It 's not really probably not worth doing .
Bmr005_1126	Right ? ; Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . ; We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , ; and there might be , you know
Bed011_808	Another one , ; you know . ; Yeah . ; Right , that 's true .
Bmr019_1121	It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics . ; and an because cuz it 's another question about how many pauses they put in between them . ; Horrible . ; Right .
Bro004_120	If we use the same language ? ; No , no , no . ; Different lang ; So um If you train on TI - digits and test on Italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say .
Bmr008_868	And then we 'll have Southern English , you know , whatever whatever the TIMIT categories are . ; So I think i if you look at this fr ; Or you could say to somebody , how do you define your your the accent that you have . ; Right .
Bmr026_1254	OK . ; Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . ; Uh , so that 's like eleven eleven million frames . ; And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters .
Bro018_926	it 's bark scale , ; and it 's it it um it actually copies the uh um the second filters over to the first . ; So the first filters are always ; and you can s you can specify a different number of uh features different number of filters ,
Bns002_826	so ; we won't have a hundred percent eh perfect eh channel anyway . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr016_2003	OK great . ; Cuz I was doing the " grep minus V " quick and dirty ; and looked like that was working OK , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_872	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well ; Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be
Bro010_760	So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , ; right ? ; Is they 're ; they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections
Bro012_558	Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro003_876	And TIMIT 's from lots of different places . ; From TI . ; From i It 's from Texas . ; So may maybe it 's
Bed014_97	I think you should demand things from him . ; He charges so much . Right . ; Yeah . ; No , I think it 's a good idea that you may as well ask . Sure .
Bmr031_1414	so that you can adjust it to sort of an any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; they found a particular set of parameters they liked this week .
Bmr008_466	Now , we discussed maybe indicating a t a time frame . ; So , " Where did you live during your , you know , childhood and adolescence ? " ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_440	so there 's there 's actually plenty of meetings that are really relevant to to uh computational uh speech processing of one sort or another . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . So . ; I mean , I mostly just ignored it because I was too busy and didn't get to it .
Bmr021_269	That 's that 's all I was wondering about . ; And this way we can get a door - slam in the uh in the transcript file . ; Yeah . ; Yeah that 's right , we gotta get the obligatory door - slam .
Bmr020_890	Ah , interesting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , sure .
Bns002_1319	OK . ; Uh well , this is something I , more or less , I told you . ; and eh you know , the point , or or or ; what the the spark of of my of my work here , or at least , of what I was proposing to work here , is the fact that these two model uh two modes of operation , I was telling you here that you have to choose at the driver level if your network adaptor is working in an access point - based environment or in ad ho in an ad - hoc environment . I see this as a as a limitation
Bmr008_657	cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use . ; They 're gonna want some small set of places , ; and then , but anything additional people can fill out , and we can put it in as a note or something , ; but if we don't have that , someone 's gotta sit there and figure out you know , I 've got twenty people who said Midwest ,
Bro021_1277	OK . ; Yeah ? ; each time that I detect noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_987	Actually the scale is not the same , ; but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger . ; Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero . ; And so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw everything .
Bmr009_1438	Liverpuddlian . ; Yeah . ; Actually , Liverpool doesn't l ; Alright .
Bmr006_1346	Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think Dan is still working on it .
Bed009_650	It 's tricky . ; It 's tricky because one could well imagine ; I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants . ; One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user .
Btr002_1263	you just stopped doing it ? ; Or ? ; Well , I think that we 'll bring it back . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr019_72	That 's not good . ; So we have to we ; Plus , it would make for interesting noise background noise . ; Yep .
Bro019_1148	Mm - hmm . ; and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank . ; Mm - hmm . ; You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal .
Bro008_569	Um So , we 'll skip next week , and we 'll meet two weeks from now . ; And , uh , I guess the main topic will be , uh , you telling us what happened . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1085	Oh good . ; OK , ; It just sends me the time intervals . ; And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .
Bmr013_478	Scoot the voicing over a little , because ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Well I think what I mean I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , uh , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now .
Bro004_115	but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ? ; I mean , my assump ; From what I saw from the earlier results , uh I guess last week , was that um , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . ; Mmm . Yeah .
Bro018_754	Is it did that answer your question ? ; I think so . ; OK . ; I guess I mean , uh I 'm not sure what you what you 're what you get out of your system .
Bro021_821	S so , e um , ; Mm - hmm . ; first place , I mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries , uh , this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things . ; I mean , how much is the poor you know , relatively , uh , unhelpful result that you 're getting in this or this or this
Bmr010_527	I mean , the the the , ; uh ; But , ; uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least .
Bmr027_826	So ; You you can ; A lot of mailers support return receipt . ; It 's like certified mail .
Bro022_962	So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . ; And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , ; and I also try different , uh , noise , uh , values ; and we 'll see what happen .
Bro017_904	OK . ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr007_890	It will be , eh more difficult to to detect bass - tone energy . ; the the change . ; I think that , um ; Ah , in the clo in the P D A , you mean ?
Bro005_185	Mm - hmm . ; because for the moment MSG do doesn't bring much information . ; Mm - hmm . ; And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP .
Bmr008_1693	But this is very short . ; Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_561	so it might be better to just do it for the ; yeah you could leave region for for the others but have circled choice for the American English . ; One one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you you know , about the data later on you can say " well I chose these based on TIMIT " , And ; Right .
Bmr029_217	Mm - hmm . ; But i if if it doesn't work out , I think we would rather charge ahead with the older segmentations ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr013_107	Per digit . ; You 're right . ; So if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1715	It 's a little bit confusing . ; Yeah . ; I mean , what 're we gonna do ? ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1244	It 's ; and , uh , discourse level ; I i i it i ; Yeah .
Bro021_1120	when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech . ; Mmm ? ; And when w ; the way to obtain the PDF for the noisy speech is
Bro023_681	They are very s similar techniques . ; Yeah . ; So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction . ; O oh , OK .
Bns001_1273	But nevertheless you can only not only focus on " OK , I provide this mechanism " ; because u you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet , using any application . ; And then this mechanism must fit it there . ; But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success ,
Bmr005_1179	Yeah . ; I mean , is there ; I know this sounds tough but we 've got the room set up . ; Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use
Bmr010_27	Yeah , that would be ; No , why don't we talk about practical things ? ; OK . ; Sure .
Bro027_1658	but just like just to know that everything is fine . ; Uh - huh . ; So it was like , uh , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel log mel . ; Yeah .
Bed011_977	Just talking into a box and not hearing anything back . ; Yep . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bro003_1774	So what we were just saying is that that , um I was arguing for , if possible , coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research ; because we we 're we have a time crunch . ; And so , uh , if there 's something that would would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . ; See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that that it 's to do to do a a a a poor job is is pretty quick ,
Bmr013_716	So . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , ; so . ; Somewhere not in the very beginning , five minutes , OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_723	Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers . ; So . ; But he wants to go to new servers not just for us ; but for other groups too .
Bns002_1389	No problem . ; So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal . ; Should I power off it ? ; Um , just log out .
Bsr001_991	It 's a style . ; Uh , but I but I 've seen debates where ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro028_300	Yeah . ; so the ear is not trained to recognize this . ; But s actually it sound like whispering , ; so we are
Buw001_1827	OK . ; OK . ; Um , other ; Let 's see ,
Bmr014_896	And and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , ; and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff . ; So much fun . ; and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too ,
Bmr014_443	then y you know it 's it 's ; You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , ; Yeah . ; so man So many ways that error prone .
Bro027_695	But yo w were you doing that before ? ; Mmm . ; On the in the ; Well , in the proposal , um , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think .
Bed012_785	S so so if the endpoint if the Go - there is Yes and No , then Go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty . ; Right ? ; Um , what do you mean ? If the Go - there says No , then the Go - there is ; I don't get it .
Bed011_1101	Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of o our sample sentences , ; the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the the " How do I get to X ? " ,
Bro018_518	yeah that is probably right . ; I mean uh my my guess would be that this is since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal , ; Mm - hmm . ; if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more more of one .
Btr002_1699	It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things , like , " Well , the transcribers " ; so , " Rer - rer - rer - rer " ; and then s be some horrible thing , " The transcriber 's gonna have trouble with this . @ @ " ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr015_347	Is that right ? ; That they didn't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? ; Do you know anything about the numbers ? ; No .
Bmr001_785	As much work as you want . ; Yeah But uh I don't know . ; This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something , ; and and uh we 've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty times uh real time to do this kind of transcription
Bed008_1167	Alright . ; So we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them . ; But um What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer ; but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of
Buw001_398	and you want to ask questions to get more detail . ; th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . ; Well , it doesn't have to be . ; OK . So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about ,
Bmr027_585	and ; So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? ; I don't think , uh They 're so recent , these visitors . ; I and and I they 're also so
Btr001_1629	Yeah . ; One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Btr002_558	And it 's like a certain , uh , kind of , like , rough male voice too , ; kind of graspy ; raspy , I mean , ; Hmm .
Bro012_1210	it 's more or less the same . ; But uh the thing is that um you then can get rid of things that are not ; i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1762	I don't remember what it is . ; One of the problems , if the file is large , um , and you 're cast to the wrong type . ; I I I don't know , ; but uh I I think the the position in the file eh doesn't work eh eh in long file ,
Bed003_1587	Right ? ; Cuz if it 's like , uh If it 's four things coming in , ; right ? ; And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that .
Bns002_169	what will happen then even in a fixed network ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving . ; OK .
Bro014_909	Right ? ; Well , y ; Well , y I I don't know that I would trust that so much ; Yeah .
Bro003_991	we have JRA ; you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen , ; won't take uh a huge amount of development , ; it 's just trying it out .
Bro027_506	Um , ; after that , um , you have the um , filtering of the silence probabilities . ; Which is a million filter ; it ,
Bro017_733	No . But you 're running your data through that same model . ; That is true , ; but w I mean , so what you want to do You want to say if uh obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_349	this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition , ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Cool .
Bns003_738	S I . I 'm talking if there is an activity , at least with the NSA group , that certain kind of activities also in the university could apply for the master works , of diplomas thesis , uh , whatever kind of thing that ; Yeah , ; we we ; I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force .
Bmr028_573	It 's the same as in the the smoother for the IBM thing . ; It combines them if it 's if the pause is longer than ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's no more than six words . So Roughly . On average .
Bmr010_960	Yeah . ; Speech researchers ? ; Uh , yeah . ; And Yeah , r right .
Bsr001_723	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right , ; so the so for us the Meeting Recorder project has a very similar uh , approach .
Bmr016_1666	So now we 're up to seven hundred and eighty eight . ; Yeah that 's ; Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . ; That 's kind of disturbing .
Bns002_1569	Wher - where the slides are available ? ; I will send it electronically . ; When ? ; After the meeting .
Bmr027_1042	Um . This was an interesting one . ; So the original was " So that 's not so Claudia 's not the bad master here " , ; and then he laughs , ; Web master .
Bro019_858	I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1215	Right . So it 's really it would be really easy to re - do it . ; So , actually , um , at some point we should update and rescore everything with , you know , the corrected transcripts , ; W we just We save ; Yeah . It 'd be interesting just to see i how much it changes .
Bmr003_1369	Mm - hmm . ; So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . ; Yeah , I do too . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1420	Right . ; I mean in experiments that we did a long time ago ; Mmm . ; and different ta
Bed004_121	One time , pretending to be a system , ; one time , to pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending . ; OK . ; And she didn't
Bmr016_2114	Yeah . ; the the p you know , the word " to " and the word y th " going to " and " to go to " ; those are two different " to 's " ; and so there 's no distinction there .
Bro003_53	Yeah . ; You 're alright ? ; Cuz it 's full . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1366	Alright . ; Well , I guess , w I I didn't want to keep people too long ; That 's interesting . ; and Adam wanted t people
Buw001_1479	Yeah . ; OK . So ; Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then uh , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to ; Yeah .
Bro004_1358	Mm - hmm . ; But I think Fudge is pretty fast too . ; Yeah , I mean you can check with uh Dave Johnson . ; I mean , it it 's I think the machine is just sitting there .
Bdb001_1237	So . ; So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by , uh , doing uh , by doing Hhh . ; Both were based on words , ; so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know , sprinkled with with different tags for annotations .
Bmr030_512	Right ? ; Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro005_284	I k I keep getting confused ; because this is accuracy . ; Yeah , sorry . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1428	OK , ; never mind . ; Um , yeah . ; And so , this this past week um , I 've been uh , looking a little bit into uh , TRAPS um , and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too ,
Btr002_1682	Yeah . ; I li that 's why I like Johno . ; It 's really funny to listen to . ; I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers .
Bro005_1121	Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb ; But ; I 'm I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . that ; u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features ,
Bmr018_390	uh you could have ; And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ? ; Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr018_1192	See ya . ; Um , oh , before you l go ; I don't think we 'll go much longer . ; I guess it 's alright for you to talk a little without the mike
Bmr016_2257	Mm - hmm . ; And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have ; Yep . ; t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on .
Bmr002_1298	but if this idea of islands of of um for di whatever they are . ; r r islands of reliability or whatever it is . ; Accuracy ? ; The stressed w stressed words .
Bmr029_380	In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's it 's not really true . ; It 's it 's sort of fantasy .
Bro022_7	Oh . ; Yeah . ; We were two ; we were
Bed010_262	But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something . ; Yeah . ; OK , ; right .
Bro004_387	Yeah . ; So this would From this you would say , " well , it doesn't really matter if we put Finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gonna be , you know , Finnish in the test data . " ; Right ? ; Well , it 's it sounds I mean , we have to be careful ,
Bed011_258	Mm - hmm . ; And then we have the " Fix " thing , and then maybe " Do something the other day " thing , ; so . My question is ; I guess , to some extent , we should y we just have to try it out and see if it works .
Bed017_297	Right . ; Yeah , that would be exactly my question . ; wh to start with . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2114	We should keep in touch with him . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I think ; Well , once we send out
Bed009_941	OK . ; Cuz I r I didn't reme I didn't think I saw it . ; Have we looked at the German ? ; Yeah
Bro023_159	And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior ; and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and , you know , it will , uh , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , um , uh , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period ,
Bmr009_1607	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_969	Maybe yeah . ; Some extensions uh have to be made . For for a English version ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bmr001_573	we 're talking about a half hour of of speech ; Yep . ; and so uh we should look at this carefully ; Yeah .
Buw001_12	Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears . ; Yeah , I know . ; It just it really hurts . ; It gives you a headache ,
Bmr023_1185	Mm - hmm . ; Didn't you did you do that already ; El ; Yeah .
Bed010_898	Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . ; Uh . So . For for ; Cuz I don't have to implement anything . ; Exactly right .
Bro010_1133	so , uh , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? ; Ri ; Yeah , ; OK ,
Bro018_58	I 'm sorry I missed it . ; R correlations . ; No , ; Oh .
Bmr014_1229	Yeah . You would think it would be rare , ; Just ; It should be very rare . ; I mean we 're not talking about the energy crisis or something , people have
Bro022_205	and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . ; So , what what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero ; set the negative values to zero . ; So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive ,
Bmr028_970	But actually we could ; We can just run it , assuming that it 's all one speaker , basically . ; And see what happens . ; Yeah .
Bro012_320	and then they built the silence model ; and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures ; and they do another seven then they add mixtures ; then they do a final set of seven and they quit .
Bns001_715	We can expect a lot of differences f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed . ; What I 'm trying to say is that is that well , uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert ; because uh I I don't see it I think that the UMTS thing is more a technology issue , than a research issue . ; Maybe I 'm wrong .
Btr002_3432	Oh , alright . ; The time we start digits ? ; So we have to ; Hmm .
Btr001_327	Yeah , he was hard . ; Yeah . ; But that 's really interesting . ; He got easier though ,
Bmr030_679	I should be around . ; You know , just have someone to bounce the instructions off of ; and make sure I don't do anything too stupid . ; Yeah , sure .
Bro014_1108	Log domain . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So it 's sort of like division , when you do the yeah , the spectra .
Bmr005_505	Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . ; It 's a good idea I think . ; So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1164	Is awful ? ; no it depends on the hand - held ; but hand many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_361	Hmm . ; Oh right . ; You were talking about that , yeah . ; I see .
Bro019_1026	there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_371	Yeah I mean , for the for the um acoustic research , ; for the signal - processing , farfield stuff , I see it as as as the place that we start . ; But , th I mean , it 'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data , ; but but uh the truth is I 'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that , we get , uh , the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh , uh nearfield ,
Buw001_589	Right . ; So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . ; Culture . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1151	I probably shouldn't say that on the tape . ; Beep . ; Yeah . Oh , well . ; I gotta remember to beep that out .
Btr002_541	Yeah . Those are i a w actually probably just the computer problem ; Hmm . ; not the gender problem . ; Huh .
Bro024_1062	So ; OK . ; Where does the comprish compression in decoding delay comes from ? ; That 's the way the the the frames are packed ,
Bro021_1095	And now I can do it , ; uh ; pfff ! ; I can put log of EX plus log
Bmr028_1201	N ; N ; They 're meetings that are now channelized , but they were not from ; So long as i so long as it 's the same baseline you 'll be able to tell .
Btr002_2112	not something I was sort of volitionally sort of ; Huh , that 's interesting . ; I would also be really aw aware of w how I was speaking . ; Hmm .
Bro016_387	I if I can summarize , basically what 's going on is that you 're going over a lot of material that you have generated in furious fashion , ; f generating many results and doing many experiments ; and trying to pull it together into some coherent form to be able to see wha see what happens . ; Hm - hmm .
Bmr007_816	In terms of energy ? ; Yeah . ; Ah ! ; OK .
Bed005_238	And , um ; Sorry . ; And , um ; you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ?
Btr001_523	And some people tend to get interrupted more , ; I know that 's not something that the person themselves can control ; He - yeah . ; but
Bed003_1001	How do you write the code ; The c ; or do you actually never have to write any code there ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_759	and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something ; so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions . ; Viewing usually is cheap or free . ; Is that always true ?
Bmr025_520	yeah . Yeah . ; Text . ; Um it has it in there , a place to fill it in . ; OK .
Bmr012_707	cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself ; It 's us . ; but but I think that we didn't do anything that but ; well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that
Bmr005_1144	So it 's so there 's there 's there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents ; I mean there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . ; So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we we we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , ; and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,
Bmr026_653	Mmm . ; Um . So . ; Um Uh One thing I mean we in past meetings we had um also a you know various variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side ; um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically .
Bro016_802	and ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1554	OK . ; OK . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , anything to add ?
Bmr015_1210	I guess there 's another aspect ; so . ; which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings , ; so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones .
Bed013_940	User . ; She 's a new linguist working for EML . ; And what she would like to do for example is great for us . ; She would like to take the ent ontolog
Bmr018_1639	or you care , you know , what recall time is , ; or you care , you know , and and ; Or you only have a million words for your some new task . ; Yeah ,
Bro019_1506	Is that that something worth talking about , ; or ? ; Um , ; it 's
Bed015_880	you need all the other information I guess . ; But it 's it 's what it uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . ; I mean , because ; Yeah .
Bed010_628	You can either do a two - point or a three - point ; which is you You 're familiar with th with the " origo " ? ; where that 's the center " Origo " is the center of the f frame of reference . ; And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .
Bns002_1354	Maybe I have to pay to this private property , ; or maybe my carrier will have to pay or to refund some money to this guy . ; You know this something , uh I 'm putting on the table ; I 'm not sure about , uh if this can be really of interest or not
Bmr022_1409	Probably not transcripts , ; but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files . ; And they 're certainly gonna wanna change tools . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_308	Yeah . ; The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to ; get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in ; Yeah , I mean we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments ,
Bdb001_660	it 's ; You would just have a r ; S ; or do you say this is part of this ?
Btr002_1977	and it was w if if if so , this would have been extremely rude . ; Mmm . ; But - but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr008_624	yeah . ; Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of ; and their parents ; Well , we have this We hafta
Bro019_727	But this is natural recording . ; So remind me of what well - matched meant ? ; You 've told me many times . ; The the well - matched is like
Bmr005_89	So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type ; and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , ; and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? " ; And and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to " .
Bmr018_983	Anyway , quick question , though , at a high level do people think , ; let 's just say that we 're moving to this new era of like using the , um , pre - segmented t you know , non - synchronous conversations , ; does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , you know , we have recognition on which are synchronous and not time - tightened , and try to get something out of those for sort of purposes of illustrating the structure and the nature of the meetings , or is it better to just , you know , forget that and tr ; Well , I think we 'll have to , eventually .
Bmr005_512	Yeah . ; So and I I I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . ; So . ; I mean the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech
Bns001_1190	And so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now . ; And there I had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing . ; Right ? ; Or wrong ?
Bro027_972	um , ; uh , ; For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_734	Yeah . ; That 's interesting . ; Well , what I wondered is whether it 's possible to have to maybe use the display at the beginning ; to be able to to judge how how correctly
Bsr001_742	so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations . ; Yeah . ; They won't be running on IRAM . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_659	And that 's that 's where the problems come in . ; So I this is sort of what we expected , ; but it 's nice to be able to to show it . ; Right .
Bed005_568	where y where you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way . ; What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , I didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal of the whole route . ; Really , s was not straightforward visibly for me . ; And some other stuff .
Bmr031_1158	Not answering your calls , huh ? ; And , uh , ; actually , I wanted to say off - line with you about any literature reviews I should do beforehand . ; " War and Peace . "
Bed008_732	Hmm . ; That 's with a " G " ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Whatever .
Bro025_216	And then those features are not now currently transformed by the neural net . ; And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features , ; which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT , ; Yeah . Yeah . Right .
Bmr020_593	Wasn't there wasn't there some result , Andreas ; Yeah ; I I thought maybe Liz presented this at some conference a while ago about uh , backchannels ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1453	And so , we haven't done that yet . ; Now the other que related question , though , is is , uh , what 's the boot models for these things ? ; Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . ; So we compute ,
Bed003_1642	I was just reading the screen . ; OK . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_792	Hmm . We 're using sixty - four , ; and and we 're using sixty - four , ; right ? ; so that 's obviously a big difference
Bns001_1608	OK . ; Maybe that 's enough time for you to consider a little bit more in this direction ? ; Could be . ; And then we could have eh discussion
Btr001_1822	I mean ; I remember transcribing one person , ; all they did was clear their throat and breathe . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1051	I I 'm sorry . ; I don't understand your question . ; Yes , ; um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter .
Bed009_486	Mmm . ; Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think ; OK because That 's Those are the ; I think the the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like
Btr001_833	It 's a shame . ; There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle . ; And ; if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it .
Bro010_79	So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , ; Yeah . ; uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and or something . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1545	Not not Paez . ; Not . ; Peire , P E I R E . ; P E I R E .
Bro024_828	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz again , it should do a transformation to a domain where it maybe looks more Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr019_1715	The last meeting meeting ? ; It 's off . ; I will come back to home to Spain . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2223	Right . ; Hmm . ; Have you ; I I 've learned several things about having been Wi - i with the close - talking mikes .
Bed013_1393	Yeah . ; And the the the only ; I am great . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1276	So this is not gonna be a major part of the process , ; at least least not in not on ones that that really ; So if you don't have to adjust the bins , why not just do what it for all the channels ? ; Mm - hmm ?
Bmr009_399	So it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that . ; Well I I I I would s actually still recommend that he do the overall thing ; because it would be the quickest thing for him to do . ; He could You see , he already has all his stuff in place ,
Bmr013_953	Yeah . ; Yeah that 's what I was thinking , too . ; Right . ; So that 's probably what will happen ,
Bro004_886	Uh so there is this combination , ; yeah . ; Working on combination obviously . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_608	So there are multiple construals . ; And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . ; This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_602	OK . ; Do you have an expression ? ; Probably you sh ; Not that I know of actually .
Bmr018_772	Oh , MNCM . ; Mm - hmm . ; We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries , ; No , that 's how I 've been looking at it .
Bed014_881	but th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal . ; Yeah . ; And , um , we oughta be doing it . ; OK .
Bed010_119	R uh ; but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it . ; Sure . ; Yeah ,
Bro023_1074	Well , it 's the system it 's exactly the sys the same system as Sunil tried , ; On - line normalization and LDA ? ; but ; Yeah .
Bro022_472	And we were getting these terrible results . ; And then we were talking to somebody and they said , " Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? ; Everybody knows that . ; There 's all this DC offset in th "
Bmr002_398	I kn ; Oh , I actually have some foot pedals for the P C . ; Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to ; OK .
Bro017_80	But I somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad , as long as people are happy abou uh uh uh honest about it . ; Yeah . ; And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again uh what will be available th is will be a code . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_329	Mmm , ; that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes , ; Right . ; I hope .
Bro003_1741	right ? ; Yeah . ; He 's he 's gonna be here for years . ; Yeah .
Bro021_474	So . ; How about you , Barry ? ; Um , still working on my my quals preparation stuff . ; Um , so I 'm I 'm thinking about , um , starting some , uh , cheating experiments to , uh , determine the , um the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that I want to classify .
Bro010_932	someone in the audience yesterday was asking , " well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , uh , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . ; Ouch .
Bmr006_1762	For the public one . ; the ? ? ; You know . ; Yeah .
Bed011_598	Keine Ahnung ; Sort of " We 'll do it on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr031_257	and see what the difference is , you know , on the others . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; because you have those people who re - occur over and over .
Bmr020_920	Wel - uh we just wanna if if there 're any major differences between doing it on the hand ; Uh - huh . ; Oh , interesting . ; Ah !
Bmr016_1292	No , they 're events . ; They 're actually They have the status of events . ; OK . ; Well the " QUAL " can be The " QUAL " is applying to the left .
Bmr029_874	In fact , I thought about throwing those out too , ; Righ - ? ; because when I heard how little speech there was for some of them , I thought they can only hurt your models , ; because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map ,
Bmr014_1210	You know ? ; I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , ; Mm - hmm . ; to have that be the
Bmr029_777	Oh . OK . ; That was in the Hub - five small training set ? ; Well , the Hub - five small training set contains as much Macrophone as the large training set , for historical reasons . ; Yes .
Bro023_719	w Yeah . ; So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . ; Ah , ; OK .
Bmr027_1256	Uh , well , we 'll give you one then . ; Yeah . ; Um . So , um , ; without thinking about it , when I offered up my hard drive last week
Bed004_358	so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . ; Um , " Goal " . ; Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed ; and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .
Bmr028_1504	No question about it . ; It 's just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be ; However , you know , if i I understand your point . That it th it has a long tradition in this field ; It 's not even really negative .
Bed014_662	But I do th think that the It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override . ; Yeah , I mean , if if you ask " how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost ? " and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say " OK How much is , uh I would like to visit the " whatever , something completely different , " then I go to , you know , Point Reyes " , ; Yeah . ; it it 's not more likely that you want to enter anything ,
Bmr030_135	It doesn't . ; Well , because if you just touch Alt a ; If you just hit it once ? it 'll go back to the previous application . ; And the previous application was the PowerPoint demo ,
Bns001_1106	Yes ? ; Yep . ; Sure . ; But usually that 's not the reason to have UMTS .
Bed003_150	Mm - hmm . ; I don't remember w ; Uh - huh . ; It was a long time ago .
Bmr031_1527	Uh , one is just looking at , um , the first cepstral coefficient ; and , uh , using that . ; Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um , the high like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band . ; And the third is just , um , taking a slope , um , of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that .
Bmr003_2012	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's the early on . ; Even if it 's just writing things up . ; Yep .
Bmr028_1628	Because , although I think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content , ; and and that , I know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the , uh , usefulness of the data for other purposes . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1718	Because ; What ? ; Uh , you mean their d the frame dropping , right ? ; Yeah .
Bro028_514	And , um , the Mississippi State system using a bigram grammar , uh , is at about eight point two percent . ; Other comparable systems from , uh were getting from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight percent . ; So they 're ; This is on clean test set ?
Bmr013_111	So So the The point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but but real real situation , ; well , " real " , ; Um , the uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant . ; Uh but in a car ,
Bro004_607	So why do you get your best number in ; Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ? ; Well , it 's relative to the um baseline mismatching ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1369	Well , I shouldn't say that . ; I have no clue . ; I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City . ; But I have no idea whether it does or not .
Bmr005_1445	Mm - hmm . ; So I I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition ; Alright , well . ; and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said " well maybe we could have meetings down here " ,
Bed013_1094	Some generic information . ; OK . ; And so this is prototypically @ @ found in the " where is something " question , surface structure , ; OK .
Bro005_1110	Oh , yeah . ; OK . ; And um . ; Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA ,
Btr002_1034	So , like I only have one I have one versus two of the others . ; I think so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_329	Yeah . ; Plus , I think it has more elegant e ; Mm - hmm . ; The m the right model will be easier to see that way .
Bro022_94	Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna ; You said you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at , ; Oh , ; the the
Bro016_378	So , what wha wh wha what what 's going on ? ; Well , we work in the report , too , ; because we have a lot of result , ; Uh - huh .
Bed009_858	but it 's also finite - state transducers , I thought . ; It is . ; Yeah . ; I mean it 's it was pretty ambitious .
Bsr001_2386	because then you can get this F zero floor for each of the speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , right , ; just look at the very last look at the very end .
Bmr003_1314	And so , um , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want . ; Do y is this a , uh , university project ? ; Th - this is the French software , right ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1450	And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ?
Bmr011_1480	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; When with him gone , it sorta trickled off . ; They and they stopped
Bmr020_1857	Let ; And see how well they do . ; Yeah , worry about it when we get back in . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_81	There are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read . ; So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms ; and extract out pieces that are in error . ; So I wa Uh . Two things .
Bmr028_939	Actually , the s Those are two ; I don't like that term . ; I have ; OK . We g we 're gonna bleep that out .
Bed005_669	We don't I mean , that 's an issue . ; We don't know what , entirely . ; Uh , yeah . ; but I 'm just
Bmr028_464	Yeah . He popped in . ; But , I mean , he 's basically gone . ; Oh , OK . ; Cold calling at lunch time ? Uh , dinner time , I mean .
Btr001_1923	I just don't know who you know , what she looks like . ; Yeah . ; Um ; Yeah , I think she 's got a nice voice .
Bmr009_78	Oh . ; And so i i his his He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds . ; Oh . ; And so you take that .
Buw001_1843	but ; Mmm . ; So , um , ; But we have it it 's it 's pretty
Bmr009_819	excuse me , ; the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand . ; If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_247	Hmm . ; It 's s what these conversation analysts have been studying for years and years there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1238	So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts . ; OK . ; Yeah ? ; OK .
Bmr018_776	so ; I mean , I don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed014_626	I mean , we could look at dialo ; Yeah . ; this is ; Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming
Bro014_1597	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Anyway , we 'll talk more about it later . ; OK .
Bed009_628	No . ; No , that 's gonna be phased out . ; Yeah . ; OK
Bro013_458	I have here . ; I have here for one signal , for one frame . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1426	CrossPads we were going to try , ; um , if Landay can get the , uh get them to to you guys , ; um , and see if they 're interesting . ; And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more .
Bmr026_38	No . ; no ? ; We 're not waiting on them . ; We haven't done that process .
Bns002_342	eh ; So it 's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions ? ; RTS ; Yeah ,
Bns002_86	And eh ; end - to - end communication , is sometimes , uh done by direct communication from one node to the other , ; because they can talk to each other . ; But sometimes it is not possible , this direct communication , because nodes , end uh source or and destination nodes are um are too far away .
Bed005_216	Tonight ? ; I changed that file , actually , where it 's on my account . ; This this evening ? ; Actually , you would say , " which films are on tonight ? "
Bed011_329	and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; It In fact , um , I am just you know today , next couple days gonna start really diving into this data .
Bed003_910	but we have to see the function now . ; Has it become all point fives or not ? ; Oh , right . ; Let 's see .
Bmr011_1503	Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? ; Well , you know , something ; Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to ; Yeah .
Bdb001_88	Right . ; Yeah , so these are arbitrary , assigned by a program , ; not not by a user . ; So you have a whole bunch of those .
Bns003_541	Yeah , ; something like that . ; And then , " updated " and the current date , when when something happened . ; " Last updated " ,
Bmr011_1766	so that whole thing is one chunk . ; And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , ; that 's where it 's a big problem . ; You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well ,
Bdb001_911	and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . ; And that would that would do it , ; I mean , for me . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_16	So I 'm gonna go first . ; Mwa - ha - ha ! ; It shouldn't take too long . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_700	Oh , that 's a good point ! ; I know . ; And we 're we have a little problem of no women , ; Boy , that 's abs I had never I hadn't even thought about that .
Bro012_627	Oh , a special dispensation . ; That 's great . ; Mm - hmm . ; Where is Eurospeech this year ?
Bro008_332	Sure . ; I mean , it 's it 's , uh , um ; So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh ; And and a and and also , um part of what 's nice about this is that this is , uh , um a realistic almost realistic database .
Bed017_106	Hmm . ; so , to avoid some confusion . ; That will be Reuter ? ; Yeah .
Bro018_22	voice , unvoice , and silence , ; Mm - hmm . ; and other one that have fifty - six output . ; The probabilities of the allophone .
Bmr010_361	So so so this is so i it 'll happen . ; this is a new development . ; OK . ; Super .
Bro012_524	I mean . ; I think we can be completely fooled by this thing , ; but ; I don't know .
Bed002_15	So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . ; Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? ; No . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr011_1617	and ; It 's pretty tough , uh , this group . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro021_1254	but , um , ; I ; Are you saying that all of these estimates are done using , um , estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames ? ; Yeah .
Bed009_284	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Huh . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1556	and um especially of communication networks ; and ; Yeah . ; I never eh e um dealed with um mobile communications .
Bro018_523	Right . ; And the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , well what if you took two events or four events or ten events or t ; and you know , and ; and hopefully there should be some point at which having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are .
Bmr003_959	Yes . ; But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ? ; That ; Right .
Bmr018_343	cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform . ; I 've I 've looked at the int uh , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel , ; and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice . ; Uh - huh .
Bro028_994	Yeah . ; so we 'll throw it out ; and we 're gonna randomly select another feature from the set of possible basis functions . ; Hmm !
Bmr013_332	But um , ; But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . ; Yeah . ; Right ,
Bro024_720	Yeah . ; So we had forty - four percent in the first proposal . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_124	but you could always send me comments per electronic mail ; but I will . ; and they will be incorporated . ; OK .
Bmr029_724	Yeah . ; He went to put them on and then something happened . ; And he sent around a note saying " Oh , uh , it didn't work , and we 'll have to schedule another time . " ; Yeah .
Bro004_260	th th the ; Hmm . ; No , actually it 's interesting . ; So it 's So when you go to a different task , there 's actually not so different .
Bmr029_10	and and there 's some stuff I 've talked to Dave ; Well , we I just started recognition on the on Thilo 's segments , ; which was ; but using the far far
Bmr012_1365	so . ; Well i have a time mark . ; I mean other than free free form . ; The on switch is here on the on the top there .
Buw001_1038	Well , I think if ; Maybe e Is email easier ? ; I mean , I when you first said do do it , um , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1287	Anyway . ; um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ? ; Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there ; Yep .
Bro024_351	Mm - hmm . ; I guess it because ; Well , ; w OK ,
Btr002_2846	It 's different . ; Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that 's n unnatural and forced . ; Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says their little schpiel ; Yeah .
Bro019_1265	Yeah . ; Uh , so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline ; uh , which would show us " well , what are we really getting out of the filters " , ; or maybe i i
Bro010_739	using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech ; and then later
Bro018_525	and you know , and ; and hopefully there should be some point at which having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are . ; Mm - hmm . ; You could define other events as being sequences of these events too .
Bro017_42	Right . ; cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months ; because that 's buying us the most uh thing . ; And everybody said " Well but this is not fair . We didn't know that . "
Bro005_1144	So you you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L ; Yeah ; but ; It works better if what ?
Bed015_2109	T 's , therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is , ; IE , the context dependent stuff . ; So you get whatever comes from discourse ; but also filtered .
Bmr012_297	but I 'll I 'll talk to you about it , ; I I have ; But I I do remember ; Yeah .
Bed016_324	I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other . ; Uh . ; Whatever . ; OK .
Bmr014_401	You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too . ; Y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word ; right ? ; It 's one token from the from the corpus .
Bmr016_554	OK . ; I mean if you were interested in it then we could do it , for instance . ; OK , thank you . ; Huh .
Bed014_1138	Mmm . ; and that seems ; Um . ; It 's more general
Bed012_223	Well , I do I See , I don't know if this is a good idea or not . ; I 'm just throwing it out . ; But uh , it seems like we could have I mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant into the Where - Is node answer ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_165	We 've got built - in downsampling . ; And so it 's only recording sixteen kilohertz data , ; and we 've got ; Wait a second .
Bmr030_827	Have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got ; Mm - mmm . ; uh , the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ? ; They 're like stacked up on benches and things all over .
Bro015_131	What was that again ? ; He just used the spectral subtraction and the LDA filters I guess Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it was not better than what we had before .
Bmr029_156	Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push , ; but it seems like , ; OK , we 've got some models , ; we 've got some training data , we have software that works , he 's got a method that helps with , you know , other ta another task .
Bmr026_213	Yeah , ; but then you can't add our patches ; and then the the new version is is totally different ; Oh .
Bro027_1342	But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower , ; Y yeah , oh . ; Yeah . ; so I wonder what the net effect is .
Bmr011_9	One , two ; OK , ; u OK . ; Why is it so cold in here ?
Bed005_625	That 's right . ; So . ; So , Yeah . ; The problem isn't the short ra range optimization .
Bro018_1169	uh and then you transform it to eight by doing doing this this work . ; Um . ; So here 's this other system , which is a lot better , ; but there 's still this kind of ratio .
Bro014_1381	So with a short frame basically you have only two periods ; Yeah . ; and it 's not not enough to to have this kind of neat things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_231	OK . ; OK , um , ; so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . ; And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types .
Bsr001_969	I am pretty sure they do . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's it 's it 's still , you know , understandable . ; OK , you guys are more in business that I am .
Bmr006_718	And , I need t true eh , silence ; for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . ; Right . ; the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones .
Bmr020_1221	Yeah , I have to go as well . ; So , um ; OK , leave the mikes on , ; and just put them on the table .
Bro021_616	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm I 'm still hopeful that that ; I mean , we we don't even know if the phase is something the average phase is something that we do want to remove .
Bro019_252	and and run your job there . ; Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , ; which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it ; Yes .
Bmr027_1080	And it 's and it makes sense ; cuz it 's , like , below this it 's a little subliminal there . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006_1048	And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net ; with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . Eh for the difference zone ; Features . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1580	Yeah , ; OK . ; Yeah , ; and when you 're when you 're , um , just checking you 're You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up ,
Bns002_34	that 's ; Ah , ; Yeah ? ; that 's uh much more comfortable .
Bmr003_2533	PC card . ; right ? ; In your new machine ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr015_474	Right . ; so , ; Mm - hmm . ; there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things .
Bmr007_339	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; That 's really neat . ; Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of
Btr002_132	It is subtle . ; And yet , you know , it 's like And instead of instead of " and it 's " they put " Annette 's " . ; Annette 's ? ; Now this this is interesting
Bmr025_417	Uh ; Yeah . ; Utterance . ; Utterance .
Bmr005_462	Silence starting or silence ending ; Yeah , silent , ground ; to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . ; Oh , OK .
Bed015_1777	" about . " ; About . ; It 's about ; Oh , that in that use of " about " , yeah .
Bmr011_1855	Yeah . ; So , uh , ; but we probably will have to do something like that in addition . ; Anyway . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , uh , detecting energies ,
Bed008_521	Mm - hmm . ; you know can go inside . ; OK . ; Anyway so let me suggest you do something else .
Btr001_1745	Yeah . ; I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd it would si say " breath " , ; but it it w it actually seemed more like a laugh . ; Yeah .
Bro018_377	they want to have some kind of a ; Yeah , the e The effect I don't @ @ I can understand the effect of this , ; no ? ; because it 's to to do something like that .
Buw001_1868	OK . ; Um , and I will email these notes ; Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , ; although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads .
Bed003_1231	So things that point towards ; So instead of single node , for like , if they said the word " admission fee " ; Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_698	Yeah . ; So , you want to be s you want to say this this word is part of that sentence and this prosodic phrase . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_943	Mmm . ; But as a simple thing , you could just just muck with the variance . ; Just adjust the model , ; yeah .
Bro024_1577	Or ? ; It 's not . ; It 's just something that 's fixed . ; No .
Bmr020_1015	so that I can interpret the numbers if I compared that with a forced alignment segmentation . ; So . ; I can't answer that , ; but but my main goal was um , in these areas where you have a three - way overlap and one of the overlaps involves " yeah " , and it 's swimming in this huge bin , I wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized .
Bed010_694	So . ; Uh . Yeah . ; Me too . ; Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ?
Btr002_1161	And who would prefer Amaretto ? ; Amaretto ? ; So we got more more multi - keyboardal people ? ; Ready .
Bro004_767	you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and you 're putting it all together , ; ignoring the differences in context .
Bmr012_735	because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly ; um ; so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . ; And is there any um i
Bed009_989	uh uh I think we 're expect ; Oder there was an talk ? ; Yeah , there there 's the um practice talk . ; uh Mmm , yeah .
Bmr010_88	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; As a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , uh , a putative , uh , speaker change point . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_324	Or you grabbed code from somewhere else ? ; That ; No , we grabbed most of it . ; Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff .
Bmr014_206	Um , That 's the only thing with them . ; But the quality seems really good ; and ; Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased .
Bmr007_431	that would be interesting to know . ; See , I mean , i i le let me t ; I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? " ; just never mind comparison with something else ,
Bro008_112	cuz that 's that 's critical for this this test . ; Do we know anything about ; who who 's was it that had the lowest on the dev set ? ; Um , uh , the , uh , the there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of of , uh , French Telecom and Alcatel .
Bmr014_1118	OK . ; Yeah . ; And ; And so I don't think they need another signature .
Bed002_590	which you have as DH , ; I don't know what the H means . ; Nuh . ; History .
Bed013_1439	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; And um , ; so that 's cool .
Bmr024_1051	but Andreas 's point is a good one . ; And we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that . ; Right . ; They 're already right now on tape .
Bed008_316	and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? ; But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . ; So this was adjusted for this one mode thing . ; Oh yes .
Bro014_1090	So this is uh , basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal ? ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So i so i i this is
Btr001_2584	No , you don't ? ; I still don't really know . ; OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth , ; you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said ,
Bro004_1343	They ended up being five fifty . ; So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . ; And more are supposed to come soon ; and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory .
Bro003_873	OK . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And TIMIT 's from lots of different places .
Bed016_276	I don't know . ; This was an actual , um , subject ? ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_35	um Anybody ? ; Anything ? ; Anything else going on ? ; That 's it .
Bmr006_1418	No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . ; It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . ; Interesting . ; The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D
Bed011_576	OK . ; So all tours b a tour happens only within one day ? ; Yes . ; OK .
Bed013_740	So we could we could say this is what what 's sort of state of the art today . Nuh ? ; OK . ; And say , this is bad . Nuh ? ; Yeah .
Bed012_322	Mm - hmm . ; Info - on has True or False and Location . ; So , he wants to know something about it , ; and he wants to know something he wants to know Where - it - is ,
Bro014_399	So , ; I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could , ; Yeah . ; and then ,
Bmr001_523	Well , right now we don't have any choice . ; It r still records all sixteen channels . ; It 's just most of them are all zeroes . ; So that that 's on our list too .
Bed011_624	Um . ; I mean this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing . ; He sort of had it in there . ; " Who is the the tour is the person ? "
Btr002_88	Hmm . ; It 's interesting . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bmr003_1587	Yeah . ; and somebody goes " mm - hmm " in the middle of it , and and and what not , ; does the conversation come out from the or the person who 's speaking for the long time as one segment and then there 's this little tiny segment of this other speaker ; or does it does the fact that there 's a backchannel split the the the it in two .
Bns003_1031	So I didn't know what he was going to do . ; Yeah , he will come mid of January , I believe , ; yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_245	That 's @ @ That 's big . ; Actually ; Oh ! We calculated a different number before . ; How did we do that ?
Bmr020_930	I ment I mentioned that last week . ; OK , ; yeah . ; But the but there 's yeah , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech .
Bed015_1310	These are all so far these structures , especially from " path " and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots . ; Now with " cause " , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . Right ? ; So you 'll say , " event one causes event B ; Right .
Bmr016_1673	Yeah . ; Anyway . ; I actually explicitly looked for that one , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2636	I agree with you . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's that 's what I prefer .
Bro021_1378	Uh , leave it on , ; No . OK . ; uh , ; They prefer to have them on
Bmr003_1242	I don't wanna stop working for Dave . ; That 's why Dave should have been here . ; To pr protect his people . ; Well , I would like you to do it
Bmr026_112	You are going to ; I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits . ; And then bleep them out . ; OK .
Bmr026_116	For the ones that we have . ; Um ; So but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? ; Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .
Btr002_2772	Hmm ! ; Yeah ! Yeah . ; Cuz then you 'll hear you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one level , ; but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then " missing segment " .
Bmr011_762	Two of them have already finished the data sets . ; And the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half . ; How big is the data set ? ; Oh , it 's what I mean is one meeting .
Bmr010_1060	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; Right ? ; And with the right in interface
Bro013_162	let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case . ; Yeah .
Bed013_771	Like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail , ; but you can use an example of it . ; Well , l looking at ; yeah , looking at that paper that that you had , I mean you know , like , you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the XML cases or whatever
Bns001_236	And I saw you sk still discuss with with uh Mark , right ? ; some stuff . ; Was it also related with with these things . ; No .
Bmr029_565	So we ought to be able to use that information , um , as well . ; But , I think we might be able to do not too bad a job of separating out sp uh , segments that appear to come from a single speaker ; both in terms of s acoustic similarity and in terms of direction . ; So , I mean But that 's another research thing to do
Bro027_1571	So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . ; And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . ; So I was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , ; m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands
Bmr021_688	It 'll it 'll be on the on the UNIX side ; I 've ; but accessible through the H - drive . ; Right .
Bmr026_764	So um . ; OK ? ; So so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there 's some time . ; No , no that would be for next week .
Bed015_634	They use it to really mean , um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required . ; So they have to be there or expressed in some way . ; Which which I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive ; but they 're they 're different meanings .
Bmr001_213	But . ; OK . ; Well If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1596	So ; it just doesn't ; Yeah , ; so d with the delay , that 's gone is the input , which is the sixty millisecond .
Bmr007_304	It would be considered as an overlap in the first one . ; OK , so that 's good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , ; That 's that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1521	Mmm . ; I wanna ask one question though . ; So is is it the same three people each time or a different three people ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_67	So for example if we alternated between two beeps , a high and a low . ; He said that ? ; th ; Uh , well in in some email that , uh , we had .
Bmr016_1527	How about question mark ? ; The question marks , yeah . ; Question mark is punctuation . ; What are those ?
Bmr016_269	it 's it and and enunciation . ; Well , and not just that , ; I mean the uh the corpus itself . ; I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list ,
Bmr013_1032	These are Crown ; aren't they ? ; The P Z Ms are Crown , ; Right .
Bed004_127	Well . Isn't this kind of obvious when it says " OK now you 're talking to a human " and then the human has the same voice ? ; No no no . ; We u Wait . ; OK , good question , but uh
Bmr016_1029	Right . ; It takes a l very long time . ; takes a long time , ; but not for the wavefile .
Bsr001_1047	because the only way ; I mean , if I learn anything on speech in for the last , you know @ @ ; More data is better . ; No , no , no .
Bmr007_1264	I have one concept a t I I want to say , which is that I think it 's nice that you 're preserving the time relations , ; s so you 're you 're not just cutting you 're not doing scissor snips . ; Right . ; You 're you 're keeping the , uh the time duration of a de - deleted deleted part .
Bro014_775	things are somewhat better , uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case ; and somewhat worse for the other two cases . ; Yeah . ; So does , uh
Bed006_1635	And we 'll get the summary ; Yeah . ; like , this the c you know , short version , ; like
Bro027_1283	It 's it 's pretty different . ; Isn't it ? ; Uh , there is a car noise . ; So there are f just four noises .
Bed012_631	Well , I ; You added a bunch of nodes , for ? ; Yep . ; OK .
Bro010_441	The reason for that was that , um , uh if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , ; uh , or one had a better VAD than the other ; since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , ; and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection .
Bmr003_1373	Their pre pre - lay . ; Pre - lay . ; Pre - lay . ; Way .
Bmr031_1313	even higher than we get with with the , um like even , you know , on lapel mikes with , uh , background speech . ; And so they were trying to track that down , ; and ; It could be that our recognizer 's actually doing relatively well
Bed009_724	and it 's ; um uh ; you can access this ; S so uh y we we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .
Bmr015_590	The the news is that I 've I uh ; s So in s um ; So I 've switched to ; Start my new sentence .
Bns003_38	so that is my current opinion , concerning how Siemens deal with with my , uh , ongoing effort . ; And , furthermore , I would like to First of all , thanks to uh Dietmar ; because he started to use a testbed . ; Oh .
Bmr027_1152	Yeah . ; Ugh ! ; but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . ; Well , return the old ones .
Bmr022_778	So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference , ; but it is ; I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model , ; so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences .
Bmr014_1171	Yeah . ; So I don't know . ; I mean , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_590	Uh . ; That 's not clear , ; but this e ; Well , for the baseline .
Bmr008_122	Well , this is the dimension . ; Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet . ; Yeah , but One one dimension . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_622	Yeah . ; So if there was a segment of speech this long ; cuz ; Yeah .
Bed015_1739	So ; and it was like it 's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways ; just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_146	but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it . ; Oh , wow . ; Is that the bud 's in the ear and that the link is over it . ; This bud 's for
Bed005_579	how get getting to vista points and calculating those on the spot . ; And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . ; That 's all they do it these days . ; Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is at minimal distance to the geometric center .
Bed014_1104	Yep , and then ; Yeah . ; Hmm , hmm . ; Yikes .
Btr002_2233	and the inbreath and stuff ; and it and how extremely audible and and visual , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_618	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_2663	Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; and sometimes they say " zero " ,
Bmr007_99	Um . ; And it looked to me as though ; uh , you know y this is just eh eh , this would this is not statistically verified , but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being localized to a particular region . ; The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of of , um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to code stress , uh , sentence stress as possible indication of , uh information retrieval .
Bed003_1636	yeah , ; Ah ! ; um , ; giving his job talk I think .
Bed013_477	Yep . ; OK . ; So maybe you wanna write something too . ; Yeah , maybe I wanna go .
Bro004_480	Mmm . ; So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here ? ; You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? ; Yeah .
Bmr024_257	Mm - hmm . ; And and I don't think it 's possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible . ; It 'll keep your accuracy up . ; Yep .
Bmr010_911	No . ; They actually are ; uh , it 's just a single , s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation , ; but it has a self - loop on it ,
Bed016_1119	that it in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy . ; We , uh I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . ; And polysemy , and stuff like that . ; Yeah .
Bed015_705	Right . ; You tell me . ; It 's it 's his thesis , right ? ; OK .
Bed017_692	and , um , ; yesterdayday there was this uh uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , ; but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there , ; eh anyway .
Buw001_1697	I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ? ; We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff ; OK . That 's , uh , my question . ; So we 'll give them all sixteen channels
Bro004_1379	If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything ; running through these a hundred times faster ; because you 'd be stuck by the HTK trainings , ; Mmm .
Bro011_213	and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we haven't result until this moment .
Bmr031_606	We we load it with data and send it back . ; It 's gonna be easier than any other method . ; Maybe a compu maybe ; Well , if not if you want to burn the C Ds , you 're welcome to it .
Bmr008_1255	Right . ; So it We can regenerate a lot of this information . ; So it wouldn't be that hard to go back and ; Yeah .
Bns002_899	that uh if you have an endless uh source of power , well , maybe it 's not a problem , for the battery uh lasting . ; But , it is a problem because you are using more area than you should . ; And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place at the same time . ; And therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power
Bmr003_1061	No . ; Right . ; Because they had because they only had two speakers , right ? ; I mean , the the segmentation problem is
Bro022_1206	not of noise . ; Because it 's like first doing general normalization ; Yea ; and then noise removal ,
Bed013_897	You . ; We . ; Us . ; But what is it ?
Bmr016_56	and they 're slowly s trickling in . ; So the relevance of the speaker form here , s ; It 's for labeling the extracted audio files . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr014_532	Yeah . ; I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , ; It was a technical term that she didn't recognize , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_254	Good . ; I 'm I 'm hiring people who , uh , really are ; They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_787	In Tub - at ; I can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place . ; oh ; Uh . I see .
Bed006_1038	Uh - huh . ; Interesting . ; Would you say that the like ; I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things ,
Bed003_1154	Oh . ; That would be awesome . ; Because uh ; Well at least the uh
Bro024_1422	and the other is thirty DB below . ; Um , ; and for these s two system we have like fifty - five point , uh , five - percent improvement , ; and fifty - eight point one .
Bed013_1352	OK . ; so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology ; so that we can put them into our Bayes - net , ; never change them ,
Bmr003_934	I see . ; OK . ; So it that might be worth doing . ; That 's good .
Bmr014_1103	Uh , fair enough . ; Turn about is fair play , ; Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever ; Sorry .
Bro026_107	I mean , we 're still so much in development . ; Yeah , ; yeah , yeah . ; We want to have just the insiders .
Bro019_661	uh , mainly because of uh , when you p you plug the um , frame dropping in the baseline system , it will improve a lot HM , and MM , ; Yeah . ; so , ; um , I guess what will happen
Bdb001_312	Is there some documentation on this somewhere ? ; Yeah , ; there 's a ton of it . ; OK ,
Bsr001_1100	Right . ; Yeah . ; So , on one question . ; and
Bed015_1900	In case there 's any around . ; If we knew anybody like that . ; Right , ; " who might want "
Bro004_1284	and think about it and and talk with everybody uh , outside of this meeting . ; Um , but uh ; No I mean it sounds like I mean there there there are the usual number of of little little problems and bugs and so forth ; but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out .
Bmr014_334	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr031_1026	because ; With my backchannel ? ; Yeah , with your backchannels . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr003_1425	and it goes on to the next unit . ; Hmm . ; I mean , it 's very nicely thought out . ; Cool .
Bed009_1038	and the idea that we 're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics ; and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity . ; So a typical one in this formulation is a container . ; So this is a static thing .
Bed015_1908	and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . ; And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to , uh , do your set of ; but you have to do that anyway . ; For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm .
Bed017_267	I can't really see the whole thing . ; or are they have they changed , in a sense ? ; Well I think I basically leave them to similar things . ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_1456	One time I saw a report on trains , ; and I think there is a l ; I don't know if ; I thought there was a line that went from somewhere ,
Bmr019_610	And then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK . ; OK . ; OK . ; I think that 's the key thing .
Bmr029_675	That will just be a copy of the one above it , except for different models from training . ; Well , we also have to mean subtract the test data . ; Ah . OK . ; So , we need to run ?
Bed003_130	By " nice " you mean ; You Like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something . ; Right . ; OK .
Bed003_239	along those lines . ; Or ; Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . ; Yes ,
Bed016_886	I mean the the old bakery example might be nice , ; but , uh ; " Is there a bakery around here " . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_808	I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_236	And the first way you 'd look at that , uh s she 's , you know , absolutely right , ; is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things , ; Yeah . ; much as you 've plotted them here ,
Bed003_103	Whether the ; and this i we actually have a separate feature ; but I decided to put it on the same line for space . ; " Nice walls " which we can look up
Bro021_481	So say , like , I know this particular segment is voicing , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , I would say , uh , go into the corresponding LNA file and zonk out the the posteriors for , um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1481	Well , if it if there was a word like " right " , you know , then I wou I would indicate that it happened within the same tem time frame ; Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark . ; And ; Yeah .
Bed015_18	Are you doing something ? ; OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . ; So , um , ; So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on
Btr001_494	German . ; In German , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_1147	But . No , no Pittsburg this year . ; Hmm . ; S ; When is the uh Santa Barbara ?
Bmr031_598	I mean , how are they gonna you know , what 's what 's the distribution plan ? ; Mm - hmm . ; If they have something really smart in mind , you know , maybe we can use it . ; I mean I mean , w we talked about sending around a disk or a computer .
Bro027_598	No . ; There is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the LDA . ; Um , so the delta at the end is how much ? ; It 's fifty .
Bro024_1009	because we 're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise . ; Uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . ; So we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ? ; Mmm .
Bro023_1669	There 's ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , uh , this other estimate .
Bro012_1332	So . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; Well . Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to to go together very well .
Bmr022_40	Inserted ones . ; And in this case only only had to remove beeps , ; because that was th always the error , is that they put in it extraneous beeps . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_291	I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . ; That would be kind of fun . ; Oh , really ? ; Yeah .
Bed015_2240	so you can decide ; one or four . ; The pressure 's on you Nancy . ; Liz actually said she likes four
Bro012_158	I mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the PDA 's there . ; Uh . I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it . ; We we could we could move us , ; Yeah ?
Bmr003_2121	Speed bump . ; A " sleeping policeman " ! ; That 's good . ; There we go
Bro028_314	and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number . ; What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? ; Alright ? ; So now you put the pitch in .
Bro027_817	That 's great . ; Uh , yeah , the next thing is , I started to play ; Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay , ; no .
Bed010_387	I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded . ; OK . ; So , at one point it was free . ; OK .
Bro021_1212	What 's that variable ? ; Uh , this is the ; Weak . ; So probably it it would do that .
Bmr031_1602	You mean just a a Z - square , ; like ? ; Right , right . Right . OK . ; So it is distributed in a way that you can do this . Yeah . OK .
Bmr008_769	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; But you have a lot of stratification in any region . ; and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally
Bro022_1052	some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , ; so the SNR is , like , very low . ; And ; so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech .
Bro023_227	Mm - hmm . ; And and , uh , ; uh , in any event they might ask a second question . ; And it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , uh , improve things .
Bmr013_692	Right . ; Yeah sure . ; They might be OK . ; OK .
Bns001_1212	It 's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks , ; Yeah OK maybe one sentence one sentence . ; why it changed so . ; If you 're focussing on the argument chain as follows . I have an application .
Bed012_963	I just ; Can't you use different var different levels of activation ? ; across , uh lots of different neurons , to specify different values ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1194	but at the same time the LDA down here ; I don't know Wh ; what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ? ; Temporal and spectral .
Bmr015_272	but I got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it , ; so . ; Right . ; It 's just to prevent spam .
Bsr001_2558	not normally , ; not for our meetings . ; I at least very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer . ; No ?
Bro013_194	Mm - hmm . ; let 's see , three for this ? ; Yeah . ; Sure , but I mean ,
Btr002_847	Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go . ; Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff ,
Bed012_848	Yeah . ; Not Eva ? ; What if I were What if I were to call you Eva ? ; I 'd probably still respond to it .
Bro027_1406	except that it 's not linear . ; But it 's it 's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis . ; Yeah . ; Right ,
Bns001_1677	a th thing ; Of course you have IP in the mobile device ; but if you see the strange protocols text ; there 's IP over IP and tunnels and and whatever ,
Bmr030_84	Yeah . We had to get some ; With who ? ; She 's a linguist on campus . ; OK .
Bed016_230	you just want to know where it is . ; And so forth . ; So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge ; but if it 's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location .
Bed014_953	So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' ; No , he can . ; Oh , OK . ; Oh .
Bro012_662	And I think we could use it for other things around here too . ; So . ; Good . ; That 's cool .
Bro018_15	Oh the ; OK , ; Yeah , we ; the Aurora system .
Bmr031_487	um , ; i ; You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere . ; If people are doing a wide range of things ,
Bsr001_1885	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So Harry , and Kemal and I probably ; So actually having different kinds of conversations is really helpful too
Bed010_130	OK . ; No . ; And I remember one thing that that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , ; I I think he talked about the idea of like , um He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you , um
Bro019_322	OK . ; He he knows that stuff better than I do . ; OK . ; Well , why don't we uh ,
Bed005_1262	So , i is ; Well , let me say something , guys , ; cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_668	Mm - hmm . ; They just plain got it all right . ; Yeah . ; And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something .
Bro024_408	Yeah . ; The other thing is that and and I I remember B B N doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick , ; just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses . ; Mmm .
Bro011_188	OK . ; Um . ; Oh . ; Let 's let 's , I mean , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise
Bro014_349	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Nothing anybody 's
Bmr002_331	Well ; or ; I 've transcribed a lot . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_398	So that 's ; I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data ; so it might be neat , you know . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1617	and , ; um ; Yeah , so I would try to somewhat reduce this @ @ . ; I already know that if I completely remove this latency , so . um , it um there is a three percent hit on Italian .
Bns001_225	But , I think that 's not the majority ; and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway . ; So I would like to to uh split , in principle , the discussions of what kind of application tsk um f far away ; and I would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t concerning these building blocks and the network , Um , What kind of problem we are going to solve .
Btr001_2402	like ; which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , ; That 's ; yeah .
Btr002_2481	Yeah . ; Right . Yeah , th I was thinking the one that you just did , like " tsk " . makes me think of the what people would write as " tsk tsk " . ; Yes . ; Same here . Yeah .
Bmr019_219	So that , if someone just read the wrong digit , I corrected it . ; And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six . ; Yeah . ; And I asked him and he couldn't tell either .
Bed008_1434	Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . ; right ? ; Oh , OK . ; OK .
Bro005_1101	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um Do we need to retrain ; I mean we can just take the re their training files also .
Bed009_356	Hmm . ; Yep . ; So my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like . ; And they 're currently um Agreeing or or in the process of agreeing on an X M L - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed .
Bmr007_583	Trying to get the floor . ; Yeah . ; And so it 's not against the person who talks first because actually we 're all waiting for that person to finish . ; But they all want to be next .
Bmr009_629	The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel . ; I I me I I understand . ; I mean that you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh you have a overlapping zone very short ; Yeah .
Bmr013_753	are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? ; Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? ; Yeah , speakers . ; Sorry .
Bed015_540	But in a different context , " oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know , Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US ; and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all " . ; Now we 're s now that " Watergate " we 're now talking about the real one , ; They 're real , right .
Bns002_302	OK . ; For this for this eh , work , the transmitter has to send a a a reservation packet called RTS , " Request To Send " , before eh being able to send data . ; And the receiver is expected to return back another packet called CTS , " Clear To Send " , to allow the transmitter to send the data . ; If the transmitter receives successfully the CTS packet from the destination , then it will be able to send eh the packet , the data packet .
Bmr002_1371	Oh , OK . ; OK . ; And then we were going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well . ; I mean notice that n
Bro022_607	I guess you used the clean training set . ; Right . ; For with the SRI system ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_137	Right . ; Right . ; but , um , it 's , you know , conceivable . ; Right .
Bmr011_1055	And if they have speech in it we run it through . ; And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through . ; And we base that knowledge on the transcription . ; On Just on the marks .
Bdb001_1317	But still they ; Exactly . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bed013_727	Oh , I didn't get that , ; did I ? ; Oops . ; No ,
Bro003_1585	It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or , ; Well , there 's different there , um , there 's ; right ? ; Right .
Bro023_1691	And I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good speech probability is important . ; Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1395	The product of the deviation is the vari is the variance . ; different than standard deviation . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1540	Your , y " you know , " you do this , you wanna " ; Right . ; but rather give them an actual task . ; Well , there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually , you know they have to come to one solution .
Buw001_1247	I think you get two different types of information . ; You get two ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1307	or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . ; Haven't been awfully precise about that , ; but I have here , ; now we 're about to get to the to this now ,
Bsr001_242	I mean ; So ; so the ; Yeah .
Bed006_1002	it 's it 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel . ; Right . ; And um we started thinking about going through our bakery questions , ; so when I say " is there a bakery here ? "
Bmr028_1425	It has some shock value . ; It has shock value , ; and ; Which is part of why it 's used .
Bro025_79	We , uh we looked at , uh ; anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback ; and , uh , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . ; But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one .
Bmr008_1795	Oh , OK . ; Shall we do digits ? ; Sorry . ; Oh , digits .
Btr001_760	and ; the the G it was pronounced as a K ; so it was unvoiced ; and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning .
Bed016_338	Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . ; Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? ; You certainly can . ; I mean I y I you know , I don't know
Bed015_1583	Yeah . ; OK , we 're crossing our fingers . ; Right . ; If it worked .
Bmr024_555	We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh to a human . ; Yeah . ; It 's a human operator . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_195	I mean , I would suggest we discuss ; I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , ; that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1397	how deep we want to search ; OK . ; um which is a question . ; How deep do we want to sear ,
Bed008_149	User thrift . ; Yeah . ; Thrift , that 's good . ; Great .
Bmr001_127	Yeah , I mean the equipment ; Right . ; The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything . ; But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on .
Bro013_185	It 's point eight percent , ; so . ; Oh . ; I see .
Bmr025_38	Just So , " transcripts " is the sub - directory ? ; Uh Yes . Uh - huh . ; OK . ; So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those
Bmr003_1151	So . ; But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out . ; And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ? ; Thirty or forty .
Bro024_511	But if you have muddy condition training you get only twenty percent . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_169	go ahead . ; Well , I mean you 've written in you 've written in what uh seems to be required ; like what else is is do you want ? ; If that 's permissible then I 'm happy .
Bro003_581	But n for example , in Spain , the Spanish have several phone that d doesn't appear in the E English and we thought to complete . ; But for that , it needs we must r h do a lot of work because we need to generate new tran transcription for the database that we have . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_900	Actually , not randomly . ; Not randomly ; We knew we knew that it had these insertion errors from ; It had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers
Bro025_482	And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; So it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , I guess , actually .
Bmr020_135	have you did you look at the URL ? ; Um , I haven't gotten over to there yet , ; but what our discussion yesterday , I really I I wanna submit one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1463	Someone who actually does take notes , ; um , I 'm very bad at note - taking . ; But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not , ; I always write down the wrong things .
Bro005_827	Yeah . ; Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that ; Mm - hmm . ; but I think if you if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words
Bmr031_1506	What if we make the system really annoyed ? ; OK - Anyway . I I should move on ; cuz we 're running late , ; Yeah .
Bmr031_995	so that , uh , the mikes are in order . ; Oh , thank you . Thank you . ; OK . ; Should help with the transcripts .
Bed013_322	He 's coming back when ? ; Uh next ; Well , I think we think we 'll see him definitely on Tuesday for the next ; Or , no , wait .
Buw001_2000	OK , good . ; They 're still gonna overlap , ; Um , ; but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic
Bed014_417	OK . ; So um ; Ah , communication ! ; Huh ?
Bro018_1127	I think it was about five percent error for the PZM channel . ; Five . ; f I think . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_715	So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers . ; I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . ; And , um , ; we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together .
Bed014_296	So But anyway , ; yeah . ; I so I I did see that . ; Oh wha Yeah . Before we get started on this st
Bmr005_982	Uh , they do . ; or every ; w w And we talked to them about recording some more ; and we 're going to ,
Bmr007_91	so Basically , um as you know , uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap . ; It 's not indicated with , um uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that OK , so , It 's indicated to to so the people know what parts of sp which which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others . ; So , I used this mark and , um and , uh uh , divided the ; I wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes , of which we ended up with forty five , and a little bit .
Bro005_1265	I think they were also mainly , ; well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , ; but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now ; to just trying to get the best from this this architecture .
Bro004_169	Yeah . ; Twenty percent further ? ; Twenty to to thirty percent further . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1064	like by the time he graduates , ; OK ; uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . ; I j wa I I assume everybody knows that ,
Bns002_626	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'm getting more uh let 's say more gain than another . ; Yeah ,
Bmr013_457	Yep . ; You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah that that 's all I was thinking about .
Btr001_1846	but I w ; from having listened to all these people , ; I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_920	Yeah . ; OK . ; And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space , ; It 's possible yeah .
Bsr001_1758	Mmm . ; It 's about ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_703	and neither is the sentence part of the phrase . ; Right . ; I I 'm pretty sure that you can do that , ; but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting .
Bmr019_373	Now you 're all watching me . ; It f it clips over your ears . ; Alright . ; This way .
Bro024_1128	Please give me one . ; Ah , we need one more over here . ; OK , maybe there 's not enough for everybody . ; I can share with Barry .
Bmr031_957	Are they like these , ; Yeah , they 're like those . ; right ? ; Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately .
Btr002_3391	So long as I can tell what they are . ; So we do need to add that one ? ; I think it 's good for you to add the " pron " . ; OK . Sure . OK .
Bmr013_336	so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , ; Yeah . ; and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . ; I mean this is the kind of reason why
Bed016_447	That 's brilliant ! ; Oh my god ! ; Hhh . ; You d you really now I I spent the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story
Bmr007_611	Well , it seems like there are two possibilities there , ; I mean i it seems like if you have just two people it 's not really , y like a meeting , w is not as similar as the rest of the of the sample . ; It depends on what you 're after , of course , ; but It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh an experimental condition , with more than two .
Bed011_198	Yeah , so let 's s uh s see I th I think that from one point of view , Uh , um , all these places are the same , ; so that d d That , um in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , ; so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . ; And um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . Um are all big - ish things that um you know have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine .
Bro021_1348	Oh , it 's it 's the for me it 's the first time that I am working with VTS . ; Uh ; Yeah . ; No , it 's interesting .
Bro012_1120	Mm - hmm . ; Also is Stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about uh voiced - unvoiced ; to work uh here in voiced - unvoiced detection . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1336	Um . ; And Mari also , ; we had This came up when she she was here . ; That 's important .
Bmr013_66	Just myself , rather . ; So it will not take long . ; Um ; Uh , what what do you think ?
Bed009_1112	Yeah , ; yep yep yep yep ; and about the situation about " Is it raining ? " ; I don't know .
Bmr024_1458	So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . ; And and then we train from scratch . ; So we com we do a , you know , w um We collect the uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train . ; And then , from there we do ,
Bmr009_1443	It 's I 'm s I ha ; Well . Well . I mean , pure ; OK , we 'll do it that way . ; Actually , I like that a lot .
Bed014_586	Yeah . ; priming a spreading activation ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro025_352	The smoothing ? ; Yeah . The you smooth it and then delay the decision by ; So . ; Right .
Bed012_534	Like the Endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes - net for Where - Is until after you 've decided whether you wanna go there or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Show us the way , Bhaskara .
Btr002_1910	Yeah . ; You know , I 'm really interested in this topic . ; Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this ? ; Or do you need to g do people need to leave .
Bmr001_689	Right . ; But I mean if we if we want Jerry 's group to use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers , ; right ? ; Right .
Bro028_1081	And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , ; in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings ; and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , uh , energy and fre and frequency . ; And some are emphasizing downward
Bmr001_506	Somebody used it recently . ; but at this point I think it 's he 's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago , ; so if nobody else is doing feature calculation ; Yeah .
Bro004_193	our error rates uh with the baseline error rate is around uh one point one . ; So . ; Yes . And it 's something like one point three of of the uh ; I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline ,
Bmr009_414	Mm - hmm . ; So you don't have to worry about it . ; And here 's the three types of overlaps . ; Yeah .
Btr001_985	and those distinctions could be added later if needed ; but it 's unlikely that they would be . ; And it 's so time - consuming . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_470	Yeah . Pfff . Yeah . ; Right . It 's not a big deal . ; So , what 's the turn around period right now from IBM ? ; Well , they There was
Bed003_1640	um , ; Sorry . ; I was just reading the screen . ; OK .
Bmr018_350	What you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface ? ; Um , I know for a fact that one of those sh she could really well she could judge what th what the number was based on the on the waveform . ; Yeah , that 's actually true . ; Yeah , you 're right .
Bro005_959	so uh , train to have neural networks that ; um , um , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; does a regression
Bmr012_935	I mean we do we we we we we wanna find all this stuff out , ; well we could try it . ; we don't know . ; We 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans .
Bed009_487	Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think ; OK because That 's Those are the ; I think the the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like ; and then what the action planner does with it
Bmr026_704	Um . Yeah . ; I You know , I I 've heard some comments about like this . ; That m could be . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_574	So , the the simple idea behind a support vector machine is um , you have you have this feature space , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; and then it finds the optimal separating plane , um between these two different um classes ,
Bmr024_762	and and one of them is , what about , uh , consent issues ? ; And the other one is , what about transcription ? ; Transcription is done in Munich . ; Are ?
Bmr010_515	OK . ; Uh , and we also have these we have the advantage of having distant mikes too . ; So that , you cou yo ; Yeah , although the the
Bro023_1010	but it varies a lot . ; Mmm , ; and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_603	Yeah . ; Well , yeah . Y you do , becau ; You 're gonna Yeah , you 're gonna hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context . ; But you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech , or , uh , y noise , or whatever .
Bed015_850	Yeah , I mean , I I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence ; And all ; I believe you , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1097	You know ? ; it 's ; you can't work on everything . ; Yeah .
Bed015_2096	OK . ; um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . ; So you have nothing . ; Just a white piece of paper .
Bmr003_2316	I I 'm paid for . ; OK , great . ; I have no problem . ; No , but w certainly one of the issues is is the , uh is security .
Bro011_102	and that 's not taken into account right now . ; Um . Yeah . ; And there again , yeah . ; For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , " we can try it but "
Bns001_1367	So that 's why , I think , yeah , it 's a good question . ; Yeah . ; Now , that 's the point why I am focussing on more on the ; Yep .
Bmr009_180	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1515	you know , I 'm not an application expert , ; I ; We have some content . ; We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned .
Bmr023_111	Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence . ; But anyway , they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes , you know , saying O , and so , it 's not i not identical . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed011_259	And then we have the " Fix " thing , and then maybe " Do something the other day " thing , ; so . My question is ; I guess , to some extent , we should y we just have to try it out and see if it works . ; It would be challenging , in in a sense , to try to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex thing in terms of
Bmr015_908	why . ; But the instantaneous frequency , ; wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ? ; I mean , I think if you
Bsr001_1613	sort of ; Right . ; Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly ; and makes sense how to do .
Bed016_336	End of story . ; Anything I forgot that we should mention ? ; Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . ; Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ?
Bed010_297	And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal " group - ware " server at EML , ; make that open to all of us and them , ; so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there ; and they put what they do in there
Bed014_860	But , yeah , a second that would be great . ; So , uh , a sec I mean you 're gonna need it anyway . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , and I would like to d discuss it
Bmr028_168	I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played . ; Mm - hmm . ; I understand what you mean . ; Yeah .
Bro013_365	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine .
Bmr022_958	It 's non - standard , ; and so you can't just plug something in . ; You need to get it wired . ; Oh , I 'm sorry .
Bed016_971	thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist ; you could think of it that way , ; but . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_823	And , then ; OK . ; So they 're really running out of , data , prett I mean that 's good . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1671	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; It would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism ; since there are so many cases where you actually need
Bro007_102	but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've they 're still made some changes in the features ; OK . ; and well but uh actually our results are better than their results . ; Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results
Bmr028_282	so that 's the point when I 'll need to look more carefully at what y what what you guys have . ; So , is the end of the month still the the d ? ; Right . The week after th th ; The Monday the week after next is July second ,
Bro018_991	I mean , there 's other small differences ; There 's a cubic root that happens , ; right ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_717	u R D RDR , ; Ask Dan Ellis . ; Or ; yeah .
Bed003_967	I mean in a way this is a lot of good features in Java ; it 's cra has a GUI and it 's uh ; Mm - hmm . ; I guess those are the main two things .
Bmr031_455	Well that 's that 's why I 'm asking . ; But , uh , ; Well , it will be interesting to find out why they are choosing a higher sampling ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1588	We could still do the beep file . ; Yeah again I I think that that is probably less of a problem ; because if you 're if there 's If if a if a word is is split , then they might have to listen to it a few times to really understand that they can't quite get it . ; OK .
Bmr016_195	OK ; cognitively it 's much easier . ; I also had a hard hard time with the words , ; but then we went back and forth on that .
Bed014_990	Hhh . Maybe I do need a Palm Pilot . ; So there 's Nothing 's impeding Monday anymore either . ; That doesn't apply to a ; Get a fresh start
Btr002_3140	Yeah . ; You know , it 's not the IPA ; and it 's just , I I just sort of think , um , it 's best to leave it with " X ; Mmm .
Bed016_1128	um , ; Right . ; s See you . ; and deal with .
Bed014_634	so so but my guess is what what 'll probably will happen , Here 's a here 's a proposed design . is that there 're certain constructions which , uh , for our purposes do change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds ; and ; th that the , uh , standard way that that the these contexts work is sort of stack - like or whatever , ; but that 's sort of the most recent thing .
Bdb001_860	Hmm . ; Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient ; but everyone can program in Perl and and use it . ; OK .
Btr001_1659	Yeah . ; it 's just a big mess . ; Or if they 're breathing loudly . ; So .
Bmr014_195	And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that . ; Right . ; And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , ; as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .
Bro026_427	Some kind would be good . ; You know ? ; I would think . ; Well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame .
Bro024_666	which is point four point six , right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And if it changes to point five point five , which is equal @ @ for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty - eight percent .
Bns002_1541	Paez . ; Ah , Peire . ; No , no , no . ; Paez .
Bro023_1032	Yeah , the one you showed yesterday . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , I don't know if you have these improvement the detailed improvements for Italian , Finnish , and Spanish there
Bro019_236	and it can control , uh , how many it runs simultaneously . ; So " run command " doesn't use P - make , or ? ; It uses " export " underlyingly . ; But , if you
Bmr003_1126	But ; you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour , ; he 's worth " ; And so he so here we 're thinking , " well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . "
Bro017_394	Probably not . ; Yeah . ; Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules . ; Ah .
Bed013_1240	Yeah . Precisely . ; That 's that 's ; So , w ; So tha is that what you 're t talking about ?
Bmr019_1204	That is Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels . ; So you you id identify by some criterion , ; which is pause length ; you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts ,
Btr001_2587	you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , ; and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all , ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_311	Right . ; Yeah . ; You have a lot of a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting . ; Right .
Bmr027_584	Oh . ; and ; So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ? ; I don't think , uh They 're so recent , these visitors .
Bed013_804	yeah we actually Have we made any progress on what we decided , uh , last week ? ; I 'm sure you read the transcript of last week 's meeting in red ; so sh so you 're up to dated caught up . ; No . Sorry .
Bmr031_1663	How was y Did you catch fish , ; or ? ; No . ; No . No fish . OK .
Bmr009_1132	And ; We could always ask them if they 're from ; well , enough about their ; I mean . So so I would say Germany
Bmr022_1034	I don't remember what it 's called . ; Hmm . ; OK , then uh , another issue on file reorganization is , uh , making data available to people outside ICSI . ; So , specifically , the U W folks have been wanting to get access to it .
Bed015_1828	I I don't know the answer ; but but , um , it does seem that , ; you know , this is this is coming along . ; I think it 's it 's converging .
Bro008_508	Uh , now , I 'm interested in , um , uh looking at the experiments where you use , um uh , data from multiple languages to train the neural net . ; And I don't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but that would be some it 'd be interesting to me . ; Yeah , but ; S b
Bmr005_188	Right , ; aren't you ? ; so it 's great . ; Right .
Bed010_45	Yeah , for a couple ; Yeah . ; So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a er in XML ; and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else .
Bro023_58	And we haven't met for a couple of weeks . ; We didn't meet last week , Morgan . ; Um , I went around and talked to everybody , ; and it seemed like they they had some new results
Bmr001_236	is that their point ? ; I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions . ; I think uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's if it 's near field , the mathematics of beam beam steering is different . ; But .
Bmr024_648	I L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space , ; Mm - hmm . ; and disk is pretty cheap . ; OK .
Bmr022_46	and basically , it 's assigning the wrong speaker to the text , and it all gets unaligned . ; So it 's very difficult to do . ; Hmm . ; So it took me several hours just to do that .
Bro026_896	Right . ; Um , and then the other thing , uh , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything , ; but , I mean . Um , just wondering really . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1531	Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK At least not if we 're going to use Snack . ; OK . ; I mean you would have to do something ourselves . ; Well , or use the one that crawls .
Btr001_389	Yeah . ; Sometimes ; And actually ; Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , " What did you say there ? "
Bmr020_1700	Uh - huh ; And i the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech to to one of the channels , ; so . ; Uh - I haven't - I didn't think of of s of this before ,
Btr002_1943	He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him . ; Oh , no . ; And this is without the channelized interface . ; So you you have no idea .
Bed014_1198	You basically are told , to to do this ; In the in analogously to the way you would do " someone fixed the car with a wrench " . ; And then you hand it back to your hippocampus ; and find out what that , you know ,
Btr002_2065	Did you guys ever , ; when This happened to me when I first started transcribing , ; cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before , ; Is it OK if we stay for another half hour in this room ?
Bmr011_95	Yeah . ; Um , ; so , better quality close talking mikes . ; So the one issue was that the the , uh , lapel mike , uh , isn't as good as you would like .
Bmr015_881	from from the spectrum directly , ; and to study the energy and the multiples of ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_426	Or in Quebec , ; That 's right . ; right ? ; In Canada it 'd be
Bro028_658	but Joe said , you know , " what you 're saying makes sense ; Uh - huh . ; and I don't know " . ; Uh - huh .
Bro016_327	OK . ; So , uh ; What 's new with you ? ; Uh .
Bro013_288	I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , ; but I don't think that uh the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits . ; I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get ; Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and
Bmr031_1380	Neat . ; So we 're working on that . ; OK . ; There 's some work , um , that
Bns002_381	so ; if reservation doesn't work OK , if uh one reservation don't succeed then , uh , this transmission should have to wait . ; Now the p ; until the reservation
Bro012_1256	I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying , ; but something having to do with the voice activity detector ; and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something . ; It was gonna be a
Bed008_826	and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for ; We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . ; Of of course . ; Identified that
Bmr012_1186	Get a get a different radio , ; yeah . ; Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless ; Yeah .
Bmr010_299	Oh ! I see . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I see . ; So Praat may not be
Bmr019_1904	OK . ; OK . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bro017_1266	Mm - hmm . ; and so I think it this is available . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_4	OK . ; Are we live or are we Memorex ? ; We 're somewhere in between . ; OK , so that 's
Bns001_224	because there will be of course , a portion of mobile access to such kind of application . ; But , I think that 's not the majority ; and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway . ; So I would like to to uh split , in principle , the discussions of what kind of application tsk um f far away
Bmr003_2199	plus supply power to the microphones ; cuz the the he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . ; So so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? ; Well I w I I
Bmr016_1316	this might have been Chuck , about , um about how a recognizer , if it 's looking for " mm - hmmm " with three M 's , and it 's transcribed with two M 's , that it might uh , that it might increase the error rate ; which is which would really be a shame ; because um , I p I personally w would not be able to make a claim that those are dr dramatically different items . ; So , right now I 've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms .
Bed013_470	Oh . Wow . Interesting . ; And the keynote speakers are Tomasello , MacWhinney ? ; We - MacWhinney , I think . ; Whinney . MacWhinney. Uh - huh .
Bmr024_123	Yeah . ; Oh , really ? ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_647	FrameNet ? ; I didn't know that . ; Yeah , yeah . ; I I mean , I I was a little bit surprised about it too .
Bmr018_838	But , um , you know , if there are things ; Two words . ; Yeah , if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here , ; and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you ,
Bmr024_1601	Sixteen to eighteen , I think . ; Is that it ? ; Yeah , sixteenth , eighteenth . ; Roughly .
Bro005_1381	Oh , we got a laugh out of him , ; that 's good . ; OK , everyone h must contribute to the our our sound sound files here . ; OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need
Bro018_846	Yeah , ; and I think , hhh I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run sort of the reverse experiment . ; Uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did ; but with the mel cepstral features .
Bro028_708	because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log . ; So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; I d I don't know .
Bed012_808	OK , this , I can I can get it in here . ; All the D 's are ; I can get it in here , ; so th We have the , uh , um ,
Bmr027_1069	Those sneak in . ; Um , the next one ; Discourse markers . ; That 's cool .
Bmr013_806	well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , ; Yeah . ; but , um , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_509	those are really bad . ; So . ; Can can't we buy an expander that you just ; Uh
Btr002_2484	Same here . Yeah . ; Yeah . Me too . ; You know , like , uh , as though they 're like , you know , trying to communicate displeasure . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_517	Nein ! ; Oh . In German , ; You have to be German , ; It 's great for the Germans .
Bro016_335	You ; OK . ; What 's old with you that has developed over the last week or two ? ; Mmm .
Btr001_2797	So , here we go . ; OK . ; Alright . ; Ready ,
Bsr001_1493	We sort of wanted to , you know , encourage like everybody to talk , ; try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate ; and ; So if
Bed008_1435	right ? ; Oh , OK . ; OK . ; Alright , right .
Bed010_875	And it just it was just terribly frustrating for him , ; Yeah . ; and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing . ; I see .
Bro027_520	So it 's @ @ ; Uh , ; It 's like forty plus forty plus ; median .
Bdb001_773	OK . ; Well , in that case you would add that to this format ; OK . ; So we would basically be sort of , um , taking the format and enriching it with things that we wanna query in relation to the words that are already in the file ,
Bro003_1235	Yes . ; again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards . ; Yeah . ; And I think there there there 's I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now .
Buw001_354	I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . ; And at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on . ; At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords ; I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is ,
Bro018_1196	but uh but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here . ; That 's that 's Yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah . ; That 's a good point .
Btr001_2545	but it 's li it 's like this really ; Li ; Yeah , ; and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on ,
Bro003_602	You know , you 're really asking this net to learn . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's kind of hard .
Bmr022_238	Well you th ; or ; So just r r truly chron chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_691	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it ; and I think
Bmr020_295	Well , we didn't get to look at that , ; Yeah , ; that 's a good point . ; yeah .
Bns001_1249	That means the wireless networks ; because that provides , in principle , the mobility . ; And these mechan ; And you see that there 's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks .
Bed014_1160	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , we 've talked a little bit about that , too , ; which
Bed011_117	that 's Fey . ; I 've I understand everything . ; And she does know everything . ; Yes I do .
Bns003_99	Do you find the time ? ; So . ; That 's OK for me . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_487	and ; um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? ; Um , interesting idea . ; In principle , I I would say yes , although I still am doing some the final - pass editing ,
Bro024_768	it was surprising ; At the beginning it was not surprising to me that you get really the best results on doing it this way , ; I mean , in comparison to any type of training on clean data and any type of processing . ; But it was
Bro004_1008	Uh , yeah . ; So I think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , ; so we can get uh key key questions answered uh before then ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1453	OK . ; now they are I think they have more time ; because they have this ; well , Eurospeech deadline is over
Bmr005_839	So . ; It looks good . ; I 'll be in touch . ; Thanks .
Bmr031_143	Wouldn't Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ? ; Yeah . ; And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver ; I could try and draw it
Bmr030_701	Yeah . ; Yeah . I think that 's it . ; Yeah . ; That was it .
Bed013_1318	So it 's like you infer the speaker intent , ; and then infer a plan , a larger plan from that , for which you have the additional information , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1312	i do you kn sort of uh , that ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's really about this ; but why would you care about this ?
Bed015_587	Oh , I yeah , I , uh , uh I think that 's Not k I th ; I don't think it 's completely right . ; I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b ; the form did constrain the meaning ,
Bed009_590	it 's it sounds like it 's you know stand alone . ; It doesn't interact , ; it doesn't ; That 's why I 'm saying .
Bed006_957	But this is a technical detail . ; So a pointer a way to really say pointers . ; Basically references from the roles in the schema the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha uh I 'm assuming . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_501	I mean , he was saying gigabytes . ; Oh , gigabytes . I see . ; And so , it has to be the wave files . ; Yeah , there was something weird about that .
Buw001_1543	Yes . ; I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries ; which is indicator phrases like " action item " , ; OK .
Bmr016_289	So . ; And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , ; OK , fine . ; so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different .
Bed006_810	This is just uh XML mo notational ; but um the fact that it 's action schema and then sort of slash action schema ; that 's a whole entit ; That 's a block ,
Bed013_808	We decided t that we 're gonna take a " where is something " question , ; and pretend we have parsed it , ; and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side . ; Remember I came in and I started asking you about how we were sor going to sort out the uh , decision nodes ?
Bed005_565	And every every element of that e r r f of that Every segment we call a " route element " . ; And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , ; and every step has a " from object " where you start , a " to object " ; where y where you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way .
Bro022_630	I think so . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_716	CR ; u R D RDR , ; Ask Dan Ellis . ; Or
Bmr007_989	Yeah ! ; Actually actually actually ; You have candidates . ; the candidate .
Bed005_208	Hmm . ; I mean , uh , d these were not the ones we we actually did it . ; Um . ; What 's an idiomatic of phrasing this ?
Bro028_69	Yeah , sure . ; OK . ; Well , it was mainly a discussion between Hari and David , ; Hmm .
Bmr031_364	I guess we have an u unknown rate . ; If it if it starts being if they 're generating this huge amount and we can't handle it then , you know , we 'll tell them . ; But . ; Uh , although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier ,
Bmr015_394	and the large ones are , ; uh , ; boy , I forget , ; I think , more than ,
Btr001_46	maybe we could just , um , start with issues of the @ @ the tar ti up there at the top of ; What what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ? ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1386	I mean I think they 're both It sounded like they were roughly equal ? ; Is that about right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_521	OK . ; Yeah . ; And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . ; Yeah
Bed013_51	what we 're doing here , ; and B , is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in August , to actually work . ; On ? ; With us .
Bns001_806	That 's what they do most often . ; Like with session management ? for mobile the uh applications such as ist instant messaging or uh talks , and so on , uh like zip . It 's just doing a a reconnect . ; If they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play , they simply do a reconnect ; so it 's part of the protocol .
Bro027_1891	Hmm . ; I 'm thinking , also , a w about Dan 's work where he he trained a network , not on phoneme targets but on the HMM state targets . ; And ; it was giving s slightly better results .
Bmr018_1443	this was Wednesday morning . ; The sentence ordering one , was that Barselou , and these guys ? ; Ugh ! I 'm just so bad at that . ; Oh .
Bsr001_1165	it 's like you 're behind closed doors ; This could be the most popular corpus . ; but you have to ; Yeah .
Bns003_1012	quite sure ; Oh , he was here one day . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_578	Oh , good . ; I see . ; um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets . ; OK .
Bmr020_1552	For ; yeah , ; but there can be more ; There 's There 's more amount speech
Bro010_95	Um , ; I mean ; Um , ; We just we just have to be in contact more .
Bro013_145	Mm - hmm . ; So . I mean , ordinarily you would say " well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know " ; Mm - hmm . ; But the thing is , if you have a huge
Bmr003_572	and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . ; Anyway , so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs ; which isn't uh , very time - consuming . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_669	Did the did they get good results with that ? ; I mean , they 're OK , ; I I don't I don't think they were earth earth shattering , ; but I think that uh this was a couple years ago ,
Bmr003_2169	That 's how many chairs are in the room . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording . ; Alright .
Bmr031_587	It 's still , yeah , two or three D V ; but ; Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also . ; Two or three ?
Bmr023_142	We 're improving . ; Yeah . ; Now the the You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC . ; Right .
Bmr006_825	Yeah , that 's fine . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; " Why ?
Bro014_559	Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um to make a good VAD you don't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features . ; So ; mmm , ; you need more features .
Bro023_50	Something like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_192	So you 've implemented radio buttons . ; It looks pretty slick though . ; That 's great . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_868	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , very good point . ; OK . ; Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up ,
Bed002_868	Mm - hmm . ; and we can change that . ; Mm - hmm . ; So your tasks don't require you to
Bro028_585	Uh I beli ; Yes , for the training also . ; OK . ; And , um , they 're supposed to be coming out with it any time ,
Bmr010_637	or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ? ; Oh , I probably would . ; I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date ; but some of it 's still the same .
Bed011_312	I started to listen to one and it was just like , um , uh , sort of depressing . ; I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . ; And . ; Oh , OK .
Bed015_395	And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it . ; Right . ; I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking . ; Yep .
Bmr024_1501	I 'd expect it to be a minor effect , ; But but but , what I 'm what I 'm saying is ; but ; So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now .
Bed015_1473	It could be like multiple people . ; I guess that that that that 's not very clear from here ; I mean , that 's not allowed here . ; Yeah , but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place ,
Bmr010_926	Yeah . ; Yes . ; OK . ; Anyway . We also tried absorbing that into the pause model
Bed010_1060	Yeah . ; You know . We ; Yeah . ; And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .
Btr002_1739	and ; I don't know . ; I mean , I remember one where one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately , ; and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people ,
Bmr016_946	They actually have to be chopped out already ? ; Um , it 's better if they 're chopped out , ; and and it it will be ; Uh - huh .
Bro005_1067	um ; So . Uh , we we wanna get their path running here , ; right ? ; If so , we can add this other stuff .
Bmr008_1801	OK . ; Are we done ? ; Yes , OK . ; Yep .
Bro010_1026	uh Let 's see , ; um , ; Yeah , ; I d I don't know .
Bed010_125	And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together . ; That 's fine . ; It 's eee messy ; but once you understand it you understand it .
Bed002_1092	It 's OK . ; which might be useful too . ; Right . ; So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .
Bmr015_1058	You don't wanna b but you don't ; OK , well ; If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , ; even And
Bmr005_635	Yeah . ; Got it . ; Well , not just the overlaps , everything . ; So , can I ask can I ask whether you found uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as
Bmr020_531	that for instance after ; so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted than before . ; OK ? ; And also of course after spurt ends ,
Bmr024_195	Yeah . ; And we wanted to avoid doing that , ; OK . ; so we they are transcribing the digits .
Btr002_1521	Right . That 's when I use it too . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Oh . That 's interesting .
Bed008_115	but as we will see the other ones um ; for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? ; So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . ; Hmm .
Buw001_239	Well , I asked them to ; and none of them did . ; t See ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_2096	but during the training , we would train on sigmoid - X ; Oh , you ; Yeah ? ; and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity .
Bro018_1111	Right . ; Uh - huh . ; And that that was um trained on clean speech only , ; which I 'm guessing is the reason why the baseline was so bad .
Bmr027_169	Those are ; The non - native ; Yeah . Uh - huh . ; Oh , oh ! OK .
Bed016_662	Yeah , but it 's it 's it 's it 's Right . i Yeah , it 's more ; Forceful . ; But of course , no , ; i i I mean it has a life of its own .
Bmr024_445	Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring . ; And we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here . ; So , we ha ; So , basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis ,
Bmr002_295	Mm - hmm . ; but I think that I was uh proposed before I was asked ? ; And that doesn't matter ; cuz I think there was probably an a uh y an indication that that I was interested in advance
Bmr024_76	Right . ; uh ; Right . ; That that was basically it .
Buw001_2296	No . ; Quiet sobbing . ; So I think we 're done . ; OK .
Bed014_1144	That 's great . ; Yeah . Just ; All the old like graphs , ; Right .
Bsr001_2287	yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they 've been collecting digits too . ; OK .
Bmr019_765	Right . ; And another one is turns , like people starting with " well I think " ; and someone else is " well how about " . ; So the word " well " is in this in this segment multiple times ,
Bed008_708	into mo ; so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_759	so it it lets people say what they said backwards . ; There you go . ; Backwards . ; Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages ,
Bro025_246	And all the speech pauses , ; Uh - huh . ; which is Sometimes on the SpeechDat - Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds . ; Wow .
Bmr005_889	Yeah , he 's it it doesn't take a long time . ; Right . ; I just thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development . ; Just output .
Bro028_60	S so we can make the VAD a little shorter . ; yeah . ; That 's ; Yeah , uh - huh .
Bro004_634	OK ? ; Um So uh , ; I think this will take some looking at , thinking about . ; But , what is uh what is currently running , that 's uh , i that just filling in the holes here
Bmr011_677	Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ? ; I mean ; Right , so we have we ; Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem ,
Bmr028_1402	It 's saying so it 's all above the table . ; I 'm actually using this other thing . ; OK . ; That 's that 's that 's the reason .
Bns001_630	Mm - hmm . ; They collect the dat collect collecting a lot of data . concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed ; and um ; uh , Thomas is going to build mobile IP stuff in their servers .
Bed013_1460	And ; I can ch ch st e ; You know ; I mean you know that I that I looked at the first the first one and got enough data to keep me going for , you know , probably most of July .
Bro012_1208	whichev ; ei either way , ; it 's more or less the same . ; But uh the thing is that um you then can get rid of things that are not
Bmr022_603	Yeah . ; No , I 'm not sug I 'm not suggesting that we don't have anything between the beeps . ; It will tell you ; Oh .
Bro003_1248	Or either Adam or or Dan did some testing ; and they found that the SPERT board 's still still faster . ; And the benefits is that , you know , you run out of SPERT and then you can do other things on your your computer , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_297	The The , um ; on the R . ; Yeah . It 's not a median filtering . ; It 's just We don't take the median value . We take something
Bmr003_2601	So actually that might be attractive . ; Right . ; OK , ; Good .
Bro022_181	um ; This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization ; and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . ; And also , um , the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters .
Bmr008_603	um , Right ? ; I don't know ; later on , if if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said you know area then that 'll have to become your category . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1118	Hmm . ; But they also have two two different smoothing @ @ . ; One in the time domain ; I mean , I 'm I 'm @ @ .
Btr001_1921	uh but ; I must have , ; I just don't know who you know , what she looks like . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1212	unique the shapes of some of these things are . I know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , um , um , ; I 've forgotten Someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it . They could see the the waveform and " Oh , it 's gonna be a seven . "
Bro014_1332	So if if you take this frame , uh , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance ; Hmm . ; You end up with a similar difference ; Y y y yeah .
Btr001_2354	Well , ; eh how OK , so the one I 'm thinking of is like if like " ha - ha " ; uh , you say you would say like , um , ; uh like
Bmr020_1397	maybe we could include it in this in this set of uh , this stuff we send . ; Yeah there 's I I think there are some meetings where it would would It 's possible like this . ; Yeah I I think , we won't know until we generate a bunch of beep files automatically , listen to them and see how bad they are . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1122	No I mean , i in in your case , I mean , you were joking about it , but , I mean , your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences , it 's not ; these are conferences that have d really different emphases . ; Whereas HLT and and Eurospeech , pretty pretty pretty similar , so I I I can't see really just putting in the same thing , ; Are too close ,
Bro024_1036	I was just curious about where we are compared to , you know , the shortest that people have done . ; But but I think this thirty milliseconds they they did it did not include the the delta calculation . ; Yeah . ; And this is included now ,
Bmr018_120	S Saturday . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Eurospeech is due on Friday
Bro005_1418	But ; But ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr013_431	But I mean you know some , something like that . ; Some kind of low - level features , which are not , fully , you know , phone classification . ; And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone ; and and , you know . You could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth .
Bed009_1043	Going in and out the portals and con ; Mmm . ; OK . ; But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way .
Btr001_340	Yeah , I remember that . ; Ex ; And so I would transcribe it as " signal " . ; exactly .
Bed002_1238	and I started to unpack the Linux one ; Uh , the NT one worked fine . ; and I started unta pack the Linux one , ; it told me that I can't really unpack it
Bro024_1828	Right . ; One thing that I note are not here in this result but are speak are spoken before with Sunil I I improve my result using clean LDA filter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_160	B I I I rather enjoyed it , but but this ; But the numbers speak for themselves . ; He 's Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK .
Bmr024_688	I think it is a s ; we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? ; And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ? ; Well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily .
Bmr030_850	P - make stuff . ; P - make magic . ; Yeah . Y ; Or customs magic .
Bed017_628	Right , ; and ; Yeah , for for some reason he 's not doing that . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1850	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yes , ; absolutely .
Bmr023_1170	Mmm . ; So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what ; Yeah . Actually all those things could could could could , uh could affect it as well . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro003_1745	And so , um , ; over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot . ; But if there if in fact there 's something else that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're we 're sort of uh strapped for time ; We have we we 've , you know , only , uh , another another month or two to you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to to get a lot done .
Bed008_1289	Mm - hmm . ; So , right . ; So Basically um what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number ; because that 's obviously not desirable .
Bmr028_998	No , actually , what Here 's here 's what we would usually do u under these circumstances . ; And pick whichever 's better . ; We would actually we would run some sort of segmentation . ; Thilo 's is as good as any , probably .
Bed014_689	You could just hav uh , just basically , ob it It observes an er , it sets the a node for " entered " or " true " or something , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Now , uh But I think Ro - Robert 's right , that to determine that , OK ? you may well want to go through a th thesaurus
Bmr022_877	Really ? ; I think there 's a problem with this one . ; Yep . ; you know , it 's
Bmr019_40	I mean ; Right . ; Yeah , I mean , it was ; Yeah , it 's forced alignment of people 's schedules .
Bro008_339	It 's real noise condition . ; And , um , the the training the training , I guess , is always done on the close talking ; No , ; actually actually the well - matched condition is still quite di still quite difficult .
Bed014_1243	We sort of just dropped that ; cuz it was too weird ; and we didn't even know , like , what we were talking about exactly , ; what the object of study was .
Bmr010_642	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that . ; You couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ? ; Yep .
Bro021_119	I don't know if that was ; I guess it was ; I don't know . ; No .
Bmr014_638	And it works quite well . ; But , not always . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_305	But those would be those would be ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh ! ; It will it will miss
Bed008_1184	in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture sort of uh completely messy . ; Well , here he here 's one of the things that that I th you sh ; you no , ; I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface
Bmr026_525	So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " . ; Yeah . ; Wa - a I know what they want . ; The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .
Bro004_1215	So this might just be a temporary thing . ; But But , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . ; So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been ; if you look at what we 've been trying ,
Bro010_1140	So , um , ; one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one ; and , um , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . ; And so we 're interested in , um , comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches .
Bro022_473	And then we were talking to somebody and they said , " Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? ; Everybody knows that . ; There 's all this DC offset in th " ; So , yes .
Buw001_310	So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . ; Hmm . ; Activity . ; That 's all you
Bmr030_854	Oh god . ; You can get a list of all the machines that are available to P - make , by using the command " reginfo ; OK . ; " Reginfo " , OK .
Bro005_558	Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , ; but but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . ; Mmm . ; It 's not even the HTK ,
Bmr019_450	Good . ; So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement . ; That looks good . ; OK .
Bed003_246	Want to do Vista , ; right ? ; Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry . ; Right .
Bed013_1096	And so this is prototypically @ @ found in the " where is something " question , surface structure , ; OK . ; We ; which can be p you know , should be maps to something that activates both .
Bmr012_1408	OK . ; We were just talking about something like this yesterday ; or ; yeah yesterday with Liz .
Bro025_147	and ; Mm - hmm . ; How how is how good is that ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_457	Mm - hmm . ; and we we p pretend to parse it , ; we pretend to understand it , ; and we write about it .
Bro008_578	Oh yeah , digits ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Good point .
Bmr007_947	or another algorithm to to process , eh the the segment between marks eh founded by the the the BIC criterion and applied for for each frame . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think is , eh nnn , it will be a an an a more general approach the if we compare with use , eh a neural net or another , eh speech recognizer with a broad class or or narrow class , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1560	and they told me it was ice cream ; and it doesn't save well , ; so . I mean ; Oh .
Bmr018_1672	She put this up , and it was like this is this p people kept saying , " Can I see that slide again ? " ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Btr002_2964	And , my feeling on that is , that this isn't really a phonological transcript , ; and potentially those things could probably be rendered , ; although some of them are not even full segments , ; they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say .
Bro026_124	Mmm , since the meeting , ; That was that was Tuesday . ; well , I I 've been I 've been train training a new VAD and a new feature net . ; OK .
Bdb001_684	y So for instance @ @ sup ; There 's one level there 's one more level of indirection that I 'm forgetting . ; Suppose you have a word sequence ; and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence .
Bro017_173	Mm - hmm . ; And I don't think we did . ; Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data ; and uh essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made , and and everything .
Bmr006_150	u The accent 's not the problem . ; Oh , OK . ; No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , ; e e just simply fluency .
Bmr003_995	It 's Perl script . ; So , um , ; Right . ; So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard .
Bmr030_260	So , these this it 's - does a piece - wise linear ; and so , normally if you look at an F - naught track , it jumps all over the place . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_477	Oh , I guess if you don't have ; Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline . ; Using your uh voice activity detector ? ; u Yes .
Buw001_1694	and it kicks out things that don't work well , ; which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . ; And , uh ; I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ?
Bdb001_663	or do you say this is part of this ? ; I think ; But they 're ; You would refer up to the sentence .
Bro024_75	yeah . ; So you know what he 's doing . ; Alright . ; y s so I was I actually ran the experiments mostly
Bed015_2005	Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples . ; Right . ; So , ; and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway .
Bmr018_1605	so . ; Right . ; But , I think one of their p They they had a couple points . ; w Uh , I think one of them was that " Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are is better " .
Bmr011_1340	right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , so I 'll try . ; And then the other thing is ,
Bmr003_2348	Oh ! ; Or just something . ; Oh . ; Sure .
Bmr010_813	So , ; mark them ? ; mark very audible breaths and laughter especially , ; Mmm .
Bro025_105	Mm - hmm . ; But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , ; um , that arguably , you 're c ; and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand .
Bns002_611	It 's a assumption it 's it 's clear . ; But on the other hand , um , in a real world it isn't , or ? ; Um . ; In a ?
Bns001_1522	The good thing is that the money is available , ; because everybody is paid here . ; So that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bsr001_428	What 's the purpose of the ; Training s Training speech recognition systems . ; It 's too hard . ; It 's too hard without
Bmr003_2415	right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem . ; With a with a with a w ; No , ; and he he had , reque @ @
Bmr026_1061	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's gonna take you a while to train at this net anyway . ; Right .
Bmr028_626	I was filtering by person , ; Mm - hmm . ; and in one of the one of the early meetings , one pers particular person , almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was " yeah " , " uh - huh " . ; It was just a whole list of them .
Bro024_1044	Yeah . ; So if they include the delta , it will be an additional forty millisecond . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_616	You should do both ; and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline . ; It 's just saying , as a baseline , we know ; Mmm .
Bro005_318	Yeah . ; Well , there are minor minor differences . ; And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically . ; No .
Bro005_1033	How does that How does that compare between the ; So all the all the test sets you mean , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1261	Mm - hmm . ; And there 's just not gonna be a way around that . ; That 's just gonna happen ; like the N S A meeting , the networks meeting .
Bmr002_767	Yeah . ; Is that free ? ; I don't know . ; Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things .
Bmr010_1001	not really " and " , ; Yeah . ; so what what should I do with that ? " ; Yeah .
Btr002_1770	because everybody 's like , " Oh . Well , OK . " ; And they 'll just listen to you , you know . ; Yeah . ; They don't interrupt you ,
Bmr030_15	Or , excuse me , cut it by sixty - two percent . ; Thirty - two . ; Yeah . Thirty . Whatever . ; So , uh , Morgan is , uh
Bro004_185	So . ; And we lose ; So they were sort of building here ? ; Yeah .
Bro025_506	So , we , uh actually I did the first experiment . ; This is with just fifteen frames . ; Um . ; We take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it ,
Bed006_1083	Like I I ; Well , I think we 're gonna hit a lot of interesting problems ; and as I prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_430	and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , ; either uh information on users because the user database is that way ; I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m uh various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings ; Cool .
Bmr011_988	Why not just do it all ourselves ? ; Um , it 's historical . ; I mean , ; uh , some point ago we thought that uh , it " boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that " ,
Bmr023_144	Now the the You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC . ; Right . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bro010_593	Not necessarily . ; Cuz if you don't look into the future , ; right ? ; OK ,
Btr001_1750	It 's a laugh , yeah . ; But it 's a laugh . ; It 's actually a breath - laugh . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_73	So that should have ma many fewer ; And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , ; Right . ; And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the the thing that they 're reading
Bmr006_1274	Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . ; Cross - co cross - correlation . ; Just cross - correlation between two sides . ; Correlation , yeah .
Bmr007_152	but ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; That 's right .
Bmr012_780	Yeah . ; Well they 're just bigger to transfer , ; that 's why I s downsampled them before but ; Well but they 're only twice as big
Bmr007_922	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; and , uh e e you know , as as as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal , ; Yeah . ; Do something .
Bro005_84	and training with other languages is a little bit worse . ; Um Oh , I see . ; Down near the bottom of this sheet . ; Uh , yes .
Bro011_244	Uh I also um haven't got the code yet , ; I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . ; Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet ; but it it it sounded like um the channel normalization part um of his thesis um was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way
Bed005_284	except that it has some references to audio - visual media here . ; AV medium . ; Yeah . ; Where it gets that from
Bmr008_45	So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them ; and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time . ; So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once . ; And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form .
Buw001_1640	My July is really very crowded . ; And so , uh ; How about if I just c ; Uh , Right now all I want
Bns001_1550	Because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it 's a network or other thing , ; Well , I 'm foc ; it doesn't matter ; I 'm focused on performance evaluation
Bmr022_568	Yeah , then we just map it to a reject model . ; In and in fact , that 's what we do now . ; Cuz there 's cases , even after Jane listens , where , you know , we have ; Right ,
Bro013_192	Yeah . ; and here we 're getting three or four three , ; Mm - hmm . ; let 's see , three for this ?
Bmr007_207	And places also which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison different words of course ; but you know , the basically , you know everyone 's saying " yes " or you know , or ev even more sp specific than that . ; So , uh , the point is that , um overlap 's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im i useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved . ; And that 's all I wanted to say on that , unless people have questions .
Bmr009_708	Yeah . ; But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this student and I would be looking at the time marks
Bmr003_1376	Way . ; Well , and they 've thought about things . ; You know , I mean , they they do have ; So you have when you when you play it back , um , it 's it is useful to have , uh , a a break mark to se segment it .
Bmr024_1452	Yeah . ; And so , we haven't done that yet . ; Now the other que related question , though , is is , uh , what 's the boot models for these things ? ; Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch .
Bmr023_818	and it improved by one percent , ; which is about what we get with uh , with , you know , just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , the , uh uh , with the standard system . ; So , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization ; and So , that might even improve it further .
Bmr014_950	You 're missing the point . ; Mm - hmm . ; We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . ; Not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it .
Bed006_1306	No basically w ; but I I don't if I would I would need to have t have that . ; Get get rid of the sort of SPG slash something ; Right .
Bmr009_111	So . I think you should at least be able , ; Oh yeah . ; doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . " ; and then you can play around with the measures .
Bro021_388	Right ? ; The number of cepstral coefficients is what ? ; Or ; Cep
Bed010_267	Wa ; uh ; To some de ; uh what what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?
Bed005_39	Yeah . Also , Fey will not be here during spring break . ; Oh , OK , then we won't do it . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr024_1321	I mean it 's it 's ; No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really . ; Uh . Well , there can be . ; Sure .
Bed005_1053	Um ; Where should I put this ? ; So , the idea is that , um , Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess . ; The idea is to have these intermediate nodes .
Bmr022_843	I think that 's sort of the big deal . ; I agree with that , ; and so my feeling is , we should get mikes that people like . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1283	and um ; Yeah , the Yeah , it 's true . ; So , yeah , ; we were looking at this .
Bmr014_384	Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " . ; And you know , so how you could ; Nine two , ; e Exactly .
Bed016_558	Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , ; because it 's actually important , ; which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general ; but cover only base cases .
Bmr031_296	You know we just need to get someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it . ; We want that for sure . ; Yeah . ; So who 's working on digits currently ?
Bmr020_1414	Yeah . ; Right , ; except I don't think that the c the instructions for doing that was in that directory , ; So . I just hand hard - coded it .
Bns002_816	Then I still hear ; this is during the data transmission . ; Yeah , but again again , what we are adding with this behavior is , uh uh a little bit more , probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate . ; Yeah ?
Bmr003_2430	Really ? ; To Mac . ; Your new one ? ; Well Apple has their own thing , right ?
Bmr024_1361	Um . Well , the likelihoods are ; Was just looking through the log files , ; and ; You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization .
Bmr006_350	Yeah . ; For some of it . ; Right . ; Yep .
Bro005_64	on the baseline , yeah . ; but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? ; So ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro016_835	Right . ; So the question is Yeah . Whatever they are at that point , um , are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is gonna be a good or a bad thing ? ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_23	and uh , ; uh I 've been uh finishing up the uh double checking . ; I hoped to have had that done by today ; but it 's gonna take one more week .
Bns001_300	Because you just have to license , uh uh WaveLAN technology . ; You can build , uh , the whole thing . ; Yeah , ; This U - UMTS WaveLAN , uh mixed together .
Bed015_1299	So those constraints appear in constructions ; Mm - hmm . ; but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you . ; OK .
Bmr027_728	Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again . ; But And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know , ; Yeah . ; Then someday we can sell the unedited versions .
Bmr020_1688	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah that would be very good . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1202	And so I 'm just in in progress of , yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data ; and to see how much worse that is . ; So that that I have three things . ; Un - yeah un - segmented , the automatic , and the the ideal one .
Bro011_534	cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately ; so that would be a little more like what he did .
Bmr011_1666	I actually spoke with some students up there ; Oh , OK . ; and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . ; Really .
Bed008_105	Everything that has user comes from the user model ; everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . ; We should be be clear . ; But when it comes to sort of writing down
Bed011_1008	Right . ; Hmm . ; Still , pretty formidable actually . ; Eh - absolutely .
Bmr030_699	Demo . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I think that 's it .
Bmr029_725	He went to put them on and then something happened . ; And he sent around a note saying " Oh , uh , it didn't work , and we 'll have to schedule another time . " ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_985	and , I guess you 've mentioned in your progress report , or status report , that you had written a script to convert it into ; So , I when I i the it 's quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like , you know , if if Adam spoke to , um to just say , " A colon " , ; Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line . ; Mmm .
Bns001_1437	and and and whatever kind of things , ; but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance , ; and I see it as definitely is necessary to have this one ; if I want be mobile and I want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service .
Bed006_979	Or the Gateway Arch in St . ; Yeah ? ; S So um , like are you gonna have similar schemas for FM ; Louis .
Btr001_227	Mm - hmm . ; and you know , I 'm also working with Ian Maddieson ; and he 's been doing work on the , uh , like also some African languages . ; So I 've like learned a little bit .
Bmr002_845	I mean , e this is , the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz . ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Oh . OK .
Bro004_126	But Yeah but I did not uh do that . ; so I 'm just imagining . ; E So , you didn't train on TIMIT and test on on Italian digits , say ? ; We No , we did four four kind of of testing , actually .
Bmr030_65	So this had a lot of different stuff in it . ; OK . ; It actually doesn't have a whole lot of m speech stuff to it . ; Yeah . Sure .
Bmr020_728	Um , ; and then under there ; Yeah ; Um actually Oh and this directory , is not readable .
Bro019_240	i It 's meant to be run one job at a time ? ; So you could fire off a thousand of those , ; and it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running . ; So why would one use that rather than P - make ?
Btr002_2314	And , um , you know , it 's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers , ; but well , just the contours , ; Mm - hmm . ; but the words on the page , it 's not at all clear .
Bro017_225	Because a all - pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . ; That 's what we want to try . ; I have a visitor from Brno . ; He 's a kind of like young faculty .
Bns003_643	in ; Not ? ; well , it 's a little bit u out of Mark . ; I 'm
Bmr030_430	and go forward in the file , et cetera , et cetera . ; Yeah . ; But , uh , ; Yeah .
Bro019_651	Even with very minor ; uh , ; even if it 's only slightly worse for well - matched . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_595	That but it wasn't was ; That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_780	OK . ; You want sort of a grep that 's that works at the structural on the structural representation . ; You have that . ; There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position .
Bmr016_984	y so you just say you know " asterisk E asterisk dot wave " , and you get what you want . ; is ; Right . ; And the other part is just that once they 're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them .
Bmr029_126	OK . ; right ? ; Or will we run into trouble when we g ? ; Well , the males account for most of this meeting data anyhow .
Bed015_121	Um , ; so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . ; So . ; OK , then I don't think the , um
Btr002_1447	it skips . Yeah . ; So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right , ; Ye - I was surprised by that . ; Yeah .
Bro025_553	And then see how much better it gets . ; Mm - hmm . Sure . ; If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth ; Yeah .
Bro021_408	Yeah , ; so Yeah , ; so Yep . ; But we will use the the LDA filters f derived from clean speech .
Bed005_1492	OK . ; OK . ; And , um ; OK .
Bmr016_1858	That was the I was imitating uh , beeping out ; Beep . ; Perfect . ; Oh there is something spelled out " BEEEEEEP "
Bmr028_1190	F Sorry . ; The ; For these meetings ? ; We 're talking about which which version we 're using for evaluating the recognition .
Bdb001_1233	And ; what do you mean by " merge " ? " ; Right , right . ; Right .
Bro010_691	where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing ; and other things where it 's not so stationary ; Yeah . ; and
Bed010_829	Right ? ; It it follows . ; Yeah . ; And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something
Bmr024_1243	OK . ; So but you see , now , between between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . ; And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the the m the SRI front - end . ; And that worked that worked fine .
Bmr015_185	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Oh . ; Sure .
Bmr031_270	That , you know , if you 're training your language model on this meeting only and testing on this meeting only , you 're gonna do a lot better than if you start crossing them . ; Mm - hmm . ; Somewhat . Although what 's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_299	Yeah . ; Yeah , because when we apply the KLT ; No they 're I think there is this silence in addition to the um KLT outputs ; No .
Bmr020_909	Great idea ! ; and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences . ; Beep - ify ! ; OK ,
Bro025_551	Yeah . ; Yeah . We can try something . ; And then see how much better it gets . ; Mm - hmm . Sure .
Bmr001_485	But that 's a separate training . ; Right . ; But you don't want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk . ; No wait .
Bro027_857	So , um , ; uh , yeah . ; Right now it seems that i I just tested on SpeechDat - Car while the experiment are running on your on TI - digits . ; Well , it improves on the well - matched and the mismatched conditions ,
Bed004_710	Mm - hmm . ; " were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? " , ; Right . ; and so forth ,
Bed004_565	we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content . ; Now , the content ; Hmm . ; I whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever .
Bmr026_451	I think you 're right . ; I think it 's about four or five gig ; It 's XH and D ; cuz I have four meetings on there ,
Bmr012_1364	Uh yeah I just don't know how we would do that , ; so . ; Well i have a time mark . ; I mean other than free free form .
Bed015_1535	That 's right . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So so again , this uh , this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff ; and t because you know , " Fred said that Mary said " , and whatever .
Bro012_385	Sorry . ; OK . ; So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1004	And then also the discourse endpoint , ; I I guess endpoint sub - D is if you wanna make it consistent . ; Wh - ah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_133	Yeah but ; Yeah . ; Yeah but we train only on digits and it 's it 's a digit task , ; so .
Bro024_1333	What ; No it ; Yeah , yeah . ; That 's true .
Bmr011_517	and and , uh , ; um ; So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . ; Huh .
Bsr001_197	So ; Oh , yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah , ; the uh ,
Bro013_186	so . ; Oh . ; I see . ; Four - Fourier .
Bro004_514	And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we don't use ; delta but it 's not not that much . ; Right . ; So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that .
Btr002_1680	And so it 's really funny , ; I don't know . ; Yeah . ; I li that 's why I like Johno .
Bed005_564	and you cut it up in different pieces . ; And every every element of that e r r f of that Every segment we call a " route element " . ; And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps , ; and every step has a " from object " where you start , a " to object "
Bed015_1013	I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . ; OK , side one . ; Yeah . ; Now we 'll go back to s
Bro027_1440	Right . ; But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . ; So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space ; but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else .
Bro004_846	Uh , what questions are we gonna ask , ; uh now that , ; I mean , we should probably turn shortly to this O G I note . ; Um , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ?
Bro014_1043	to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . I think we have linear interpolation .
Bed006_1503	yeah . ; OK , so we can promote Enter - View all all up a bit ; and and get rid of the uh blah - blah - X - blah uh asterisk sub - action item altogether . ; OK .
Bmr013_68	Um ; Uh , what what do you think ? ; My feeling is that ; we discussed this right before coffee
Bed002_512	It may it may or may not be what what we want . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , or i ; Yeah .
Bro027_649	Oh . ; I mean , if it 's two if if it 's , uh if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . ; If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back . ; So , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ?
Bmr030_630	They 're the beep files . ; That 's right . ; So they 're smaller . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_441	and it loads faster , certainly . ; What if you were to preload all the channels or or initially ; like doesn't ; Well that 's what I tried originally .
Bro014_1199	Yeah . ; the pitch ? ; It 's the pitch . ; OK .
Bmr031_1207	But the recognizer 's putting up some resistance ; because it doesn't like the un - segmented data . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro011_722	Well that 's good . ; I think that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another ; some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there ; and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has uh been done by our group of people
Bro004_653	Fifty - one ? ; So . ; This ; Uh . Yeah .
Bmr024_1245	And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the the m the SRI front - end . ; And that worked that worked fine . ; That 's true . ; Yeah .
Bro012_922	We ; So . ; Well . It 's just to ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1203	There 's the , uh , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs f based on the same original . ; Yeah . ; Is it S - diff ? ; Yep .
Bro014_138	which is a five - processor machine . ; Really fast , ; but it 's running Linux . ; So , you can now run your experiments on that machine
Bro023_1603	So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , uh , something that might be better . ; But ; OK . ; But the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires a a noise estimate .
Bmr014_1157	Sorry transcribers . ; Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how " hmm - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . " ; Yeah . ; but but it was all the words were all visible , but they didn't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript .
Bmr022_101	And is it a ; Well I I don't remember . ; They were three off , basically . ; Yeah , and it was a hundred - ish .
Bmr027_444	We certainly didn't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available . ; Yeah . ; We do it like with these ; That was something that was sort of just within our implementation .
Bmr022_45	because the whole thing gets offset , ; and basically , it 's assigning the wrong speaker to the text , and it all gets unaligned . ; So it 's very difficult to do . ; Hmm .
Bro012_1466	They work on the code book excitation . ; Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis . ; They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best . ; Yeah .
Btr001_283	and it 's d she 's Spanish . ; Oh . ; So . ; Oh yeah ,
Bro021_96	So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have frame dropping , but we don't frame ev uh , drop everything , ; but uh , this can hurts the estimation of the mean for speech , ; and ; Mmm . But I still have to investigate further , I think .
Bmr019_1272	And that 's another thing she said . ; Cuz it 's just hard to do . ; This is This is Bever 's Bever 's effect , ; when where In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear ,
Bro023_131	No , it 's all ; Oh , OK . ; Is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? ; Or twelve seconds of speech ?
Bmr001_130	But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on . ; And , um running the program . ; I mean , ev eventually we 'll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't aren't people aren't tripping over the wires and so on . ; Right .
Bmr013_534	It 'd be very interesting though , to have that data . ; Yeah . ; I wonder , how would you do a forced alignment ? ; I think so , too .
Bmr023_594	Really ? ; Yeah . ; I I I think ; Mmm .
Bed003_347	OK . ; So there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic - based um , concept cues ; From the discourse that ; Yeah .
Bro003_127	so that 'll ; It 's I mean , it 's still not going to be really easy ; but well Particularly for for uh for Barry and me , ; we 're not we 're not staying overnight
Bro023_620	So that 's the basic principle . ; And you get ; you can do that ; I mean , if if you have only a c noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w assuming that the first few frames are noise
Bro004_949	I don't think this will work alone . ; I think it will get worse ; because Well , I believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens ; Uh - huh .
Bro014_626	Right . ; And then let 's try and make everything better . ; Um , ; and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it .
Bro021_1164	I estimate the noises wi ; Well , for the noises I only use one Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and you and you train it up entirely from , uh , nonspeech sections in the test ?
Bro023_228	And and , uh , ; uh , in any event they might ask a second question . ; And it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , uh , improve things . ; It does improve things ,
Bed005_1068	OK . ; That 's just what they the word they used in that paper . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , the idea is that , um , you have these intermediate nodes , right ?
Bed008_146	Welcome . ; Or cheapness . ; Welcome . ; User thrift .
Bmr002_777	No . ; And I 'll try to get one for you , too . ; Oh , you 've got one . ; What are you looking at here ?
Bed006_1550	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; So it looks like ; you have not been partaking ,
Bro016_456	Yeah . ; And ; Actually , there were some tables that were also with partial results . ; We just noticed that ,
Btr002_1784	y y you know , ; someone in one of these EDU meetings , they have a laptop ; and they hit the thing ; and the and there 's an error screen that comes up
Bed010_398	But paying a lit ; You know , if i if it 's uh ; Probably for university , it 's it 's gonna be real cheap anyway . ; But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it .
Bmr022_1456	Yeah , cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies . ; Right . ; And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all . ; Right .
Btr001_443	Mm - hmm . ; There 's another language that 's spoken in Spain too , that 's um , ; Yeah . ; what am I thinking of ?
Btr002_2178	Oh , interesting . ; Hmm . ; Maybe . ; Hmm .
Bed003_283	Yeah . ; so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs . ; Simple . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2331	Or creatures , ; Mm - hmm . ; whatever . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_1285	The distribution the distribution is is similar . ; So that 's ; that 's that 's enough then . ; OK .
Bro011_386	Yeah . ; and ; Yeah , be cool and help science . ; Yeah .
Btr002_678	One source was , there was a problem with a connection ; where the microphone went int went into a box ; Mm - hmm . ; I was trying trying to think of this as prior to
Bro023_483	this is over the whole SpeechDat - Car . ; So ; Oh , yeah , fifty - seven ; point
Bro012_1469	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bed016_146	OK . ; but . I already read half of it , ; Um , I don't I , uh I don't need it . ; so it 's OK .
Buw001_1245	Yeah , really . ; But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . ; I think you get two different types of information . ; You get two
Bmr026_1268	yeah ; Uncle Bernie ; yeah . ; Yes sir .
Bro016_1098	Uh . ; And the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1109	" I wanna go see the Van Gogh . " ; Oh geez . ; Anyway , I 'm sorry . ; But I think the argument should be uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain ,
Bns003_635	u ; Holidays ; Th ; yeah .
Bmr021_312	Y uh , I guess , ; but it ; um , ; So it 's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools .
Buw001_1589	Yeah . Then we 'll know . ; We we had I mean , ; Thanks . ; somewhere up there we had milestones ,
Bmr031_1387	Some - someone in Karlsruhe , I think , um , worked on , uh , es you know , estimating noise from the silent regions ; and then , uh , doing some explicit ; I don't know if it 's something akin to parallel model combination or something like that to to , uh , ; I mean , people have done that for a long time .
Bmr010_171	So it 's twenty - four twenty - four features . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And you also provided me with several different versions ,
Bmr015_782	But i ; But the harmonics are gonna be , ; uh , uh , ; I don't know what the right word is .
Bmr008_768	Rather than where they grew up ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; But you have a lot of stratification in any region .
Bed002_275	and go through the ; No , OK come in , sit down . ; If you grab yourself a microphone . ; You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .
Bmr005_1262	Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was ; Do Oh , do we now ? ; So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now ; Yeah .
Bns001_1092	I I don't know what will ; but I thought it was not . ; I 'm just It 's weird it 's weird to stop doing it with GPRS . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_975	Yeah . ; My feeling is that when I when I when I 've seen that show it 's like there there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor ; Gets a little boost . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns002_395	Yeah . ; and this is node three that is the final destination . ; Yeah . ; Fo - fo for forget forget about routing .
Bmr018_200	OK . ; What would be a good number of minutes ? ; I don't know , ; maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to to do .
Bmr020_1883	and and they 're very it 's very audible ? on the close - talking channels ? ; Yeah . ; Oh well . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1429	Aha ! ; and it just basically keeps counts . ; And there 's something a final thing that you run ; and it accumulates all the counts together .
Bmr009_842	Why What what were you putting in ? ; Oh , well , I was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty , ; Yeah . ; I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty ,
Btr001_699	Um , not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning . ; Yeah . ; Sometimes the beginning the person started to say something , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1991	That 's actually why I called this meeting , ; so . ; cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that . ; Well , yeah ,
Bro007_595	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; It 's uh ; when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell ,
Bmr020_1503	And actually they have one also , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; which
Bmr003_1468	was sort of the way I felt @ @ ; right ? ; Well , yeah , ; what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @
Bmr019_1781	Thank you , Jose . ; Thank you . ; Right . ; And , thank you very much .
Bmr005_1106	Kind of a clean up thing , that ; It 's a clean up thing . Right . ; OK . ; So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,
Btr002_2370	And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly . ; And after a while , I started getting confused as to whether or not he was , like , just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself , ; or whether he was meaning it in conversat ; Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue .
Bmr014_1216	Yeah , OK , fair enough . ; And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . ; And they they have to ; So it 's not it 's not um
Bro017_43	cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months ; because that 's buying us the most uh thing . ; And everybody said " Well but this is not fair . We didn't know that . " ; And of course uh the it 's not working on features really .
Bed006_159	So , that is uh ; So I should still do that . ; Yep . ; OK .
Bed009_423	And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out OK . ; But I think that um ; when so , when you get to the tourist domain it 's not just an information retrieval system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1061	Yeah . ; See that that bothers me that they 're the same thing . ; No , no , just the ; Yeah ?
Bro019_505	and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result . ; So , yeah . ; S ; So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second .
Bmr024_1178	That 's good . ; Oh . ; Mmm . ; Lift the Herve approach .
Bdb001_1338	You only know the boundaries of the ; I it 's exactly what I said before , ; which is that " what do you mean by " merge " ? " ; So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by " merge " ?
Bro026_665	Yeah . ; But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . ; Yeah . ; Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal ,
Bns001_713	So , ; I mean . Uh , I don't see that a a lot of difference . ; We can expect a lot of differences f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed . ; What I 'm trying to say is that is that well , uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert
Bmr009_1015	I guess we don't really know . ; I mean I As I said , I don't think there 's a huge benefit to this region thing . ; It it gets ; The problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to it you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent ,
Bmr024_602	I I see no reason not to do all of them . ; That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording . ; Um ; Nnn .
Bmr018_1439	Columbia have anything ? ; No . ; no it was ; Wasn't Who who who did the order one ?
Bed013_167	Sure . ; And so , @ @ whatever that is , it 's the generic default intention . That it would find out . ; Which is , wanting to know where something is , ; maybe nnn and wanting
Bed015_1923	Uh , without doubt . ; and maybe even ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_693	Yeah . ; There 's this human subjects problem . ; There 's the fact that then um , if ; i I I 've heard comments about this before ,
Bmr008_1681	Yeah . So . ; Yeah . ; It seems like with the overlaps being fairly long , that should make it easier . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1309	Wait a minute . ; This is ; what 's the dimensionality of the Gaussian ? ; This is
Bed015_563	Mm - hmm . ; There are sort of a relatively limited number . ; And then how they interact with some extra thing like " in France " or " if such - and - such " , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can ; Yeah .
Bro023_507	So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice , ; but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level . ; OK . ; And so that that 's that 's what the difference is .
Bro014_1239	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So they are ; this is there is less difference .
Bmr008_1225	Yeah . ; but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database ; and if you 're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l uh s uh whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , you could just grep for " role " and and you know , some some particular value . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_153	And I 'm Adam Janin on channel A . ; I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B . ; I 'm Dan Ellis . ; Eric on channel nine .
Bro028_660	and I don't know " . ; Uh - huh . ; So he doesn't know what the answer is . ; I mean , that 's th We had this back and forth a little bit about , you know , are sites gonna are you gonna run this data for different sites ?
Bmr021_943	So . ; I was thinking about tandem system ; Well , let 's not talk about it here , ; but I had some thoughts about the tandem system .
Bmr011_78	so , uh ; What about , uh , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? ; Yeah , we 're working more on it ; but , it 's not finished .
Bmr011_835	And that 's basically what I based the format that I did ; Yeah . ; Oh . Oh . ; I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff .
Bmr001_86	W Why don't you want to fill it out right now ? ; OK . ; Just so that ; So then we 're not spending the time writing it out .
Bed013_455	Uh - huh . ; And I just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence , " Where is the Powder - Tower " , ; Mm - hmm . ; and we we p pretend to parse it ,
Bmr030_813	but that will only take us so far . ; So , um , ; David had the suggestion about , you know , new servers and things like that , ; and so I 'm gonna see if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server .
Bmr026_670	Yep . ; Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this ; No . ; If we talked about it in this meeting .
Bed009_774	OK . ; So , um So there was a chunk parser in Verbmobil , that was one of the uh branchers . ; You know they d th I c ; There were these various uh , competing uh syntax modules .
Btr002_865	I s Oh , yeah . Um , something Um , maybe I just don't know how to do this , ; Yeah . ; but when I wanna expand a timebin back ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_1546	I wanna see what people are using , ; so ; Well , it will inspire me . ; Right , sure sure .
Bed014_340	or any other one of these things ; and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work ; if it 's got um , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses ; or my beliefs and your beliefs ,
Bed015_529	I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know ; assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . ; Mm - hmm . ; So " in France , uh , Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon " or something like that .
Btr002_3268	Right . Right . ; So , you know , to be able to , ; Yeah . ; uh Th - this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you 're not gonna make a mistake .
Bmr028_474	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . And and tell her You know . Tell her your specific problem . ; She 'll fix
Bmr025_957	The point is that we haven't used it at all ; and are we going to ? ; So we have no ; but uh by I I would suggest you return one .
Bro004_782	the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . ; We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data ; um ; Yeah , but mmm , I mean , the
Bmr014_1261	Uh , we should count out ; how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? ; There were quite a few . ; That 's what I thought .
Bmr026_627	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So , uh , we can
Bro018_623	and in fact , as you know , these things do take a lot of parameters ; and and uh if you have uh only a modest amount of data , you have trouble uh learning them . ; Um , so I I guess the idea to this is that it it is reputed to uh be somewhat better in that regard . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1002	Um , and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments , to ; and and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo - speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo - speakers .
Bmr002_869	Mm - hmm . ; " Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech corpora . " ; Who 's it from ? ; Right .
Bmr009_56	and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things . ; Um Another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes . ; He was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds ; uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before .
Bmr016_1964	So i this is also spelled out in in words . ; Point FIVE , yeah . ; " Point five . " ; Good .
Bro027_794	the best that we can get i That means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . ; Then you can go up to sixty - two percent error rate reduction , globally . ; Mmm . ; Mmm
Bed011_859	I mean ; I 'd li ; I dunno . ; No , I think he was going for the second one ar actually .
Bed015_827	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_43	Or we can close the door and make Chuck knock when he comes . ; Well , I tend to ; th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this , ; in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says " OK . "
Bed003_1737	Yeah . ; I 'm sure if we uh , ; You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? ; I 'm sure we can get other people around who don't know anything um , if we want another subject .
Bmr003_515	Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked . ; OK . ; Maybe we should have a big meeting meeting . ; Sure ,
Bmr011_453	OK . ; They wanted to do it ; I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work . ; Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room
Bmr009_237	is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things , ; Yeah . ; much as you 've plotted them here , ; You know , but just but just just uh do it
Bed010_591	so I I I ; It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect . ; The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors . ; Hmm .
Btr002_1501	That doesn't ; I usually just don't use that , I think . ; Yeah , that skips ; Oh , is that what you 're talking about ?
Bmr010_121	Speech - nonspeech ? ; Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_199	If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work ; because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's um , ; I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_631	So wha what 's the significance of November fifteenth ? ; That 's when the evaluation is . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_293	you 're right . ; A construction type . ; Uh , that 's fine . ; Right .
Bmr011_234	Yeah . ; no ; You know , it 's like it 's it 's um , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1752	Right . ; But at some point I mean , we probably shoul ; We 'll probably add it to the language model . ; But we should add it to the dictionar
Bmr031_859	What does that mean , ; " finished being transcribed " ? ; Um . So there 's , uh , several processes to the transcription . ; There 's , uh
Bmr024_1482	It 's I think it 's eh , i ; Right . ; the boot models are recur ; Well , mis for making things better .
Bro012_611	But yeah . ; Yeah . ; And the good thing is that there is this first deadline , ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1047	Probably stands for " Phil " . ; Phil Kohn . ; It 's a Phil file ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_992	I I hadn't thought about this , ; but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially , ; but that 's ; When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually very often in w well , I won't say " usually " but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel w which was the person who had asked a question .
Btr001_1190	It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled . ; OK , ; so um ; Oh ,
Bmr031_434	Yeah . ; So u u u ; Yeah . I mean , it 's just slightly more complicated , ; but it 's but i you can you can go from any frequency to anyth any other frequency .
Bmr029_6	Yeah . ; for ; So , uh , on on on meeting data . ; And so , I 'm I 'm not sure exactly what you 're doing already ,
Bns002_1555	Then , of course , the whole N S A group ; and also of the coordinator of all the things , ; then Georgia Tech , I have good relationship to uh the long lasting uh cooperation with Georgia Tech ; and they did a lot in this area , also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff and the UCB .
Bmr022_893	like , and really go to meetings with close talking mikes . ; If they 're their own personal microphone . ; And so I 'm wondering if we can get a couple of tho ; I don't know how good quality they are ,
Bro028_1070	I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , ; but it seems like a pretty good heuristic . ; Hmm . ; So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff .
Bmr022_454	and there were a hundred and twenty - three ; I don't remember . ; It 's forty - five minutes . ; Chuck was saying there was more than that .
Bro005_631	And he would like to replace these by a network ; which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . ; Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . ; Basically , this is a TRAP system
Bmr031_1086	Annotating . ; Yep . ; But , um , in for instance , what we 're doing now w with , uh , Communicator data , but which we would like to do with Meeting data , is to actually label utterances , or words , or whatever units you want with , uh , you know , basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_492	Mmm . ; Here , we change and so , we Here we add something to the Discourse - Status , that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before ; And , uh ; and that , whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema .
Bns001_668	And you have the gateway to the PDN , or the Public Data Network . ; And between both there 's a certain kind of tunnel set up . ; But in fact ; But in fact now , at the GSM level , what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a a p a pretty fine fixed uh data speed .
Bro018_880	Which talks about the kind of uh com computation that his mel cepstrum thing does , ; Uh - huh . ; so i I I don't know if that it probably doesn't mess it up , ; it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already in the right format or something
Bed004_554	So we don't we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things . ; No . ; Alright , but that 's but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of one minimal extension of the existing things . ; And that 's something the uh SmartKom people themselves would
Btr001_736	yeah . ; Nice . ; and make it a little bit ; Seems like I always have to cut off pads at the end .
Bro027_447	So it 's twelve times nine . ; Twelve times nine inputs , ; and a hundred , uh , hidden . ; Hidden
Bro012_1416	Uh . It 's just to know if it how much i it will help ; Uh . ; Yeah . ; and to have an idea of how much we can gain .
Btr001_368	and so I could figure out what it was ; Yeah . ; that way . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_489	The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized . ; So I think they should be able to hear . ; The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not . ; So , I don't know .
Bed009_933	We threw out all the forms ; because , you know , English , ; well ; Oh OK ,
Bed006_1058	right ? ; Uh - huh . ; and and and they they are obviously , via identifiers , identified to be the same thing here . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_883	Mm - hmm . ; Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bed015_1190	Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's it 's like I was thinking of type constraints ; but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema .
Btr002_730	Good . ; But sometimes you 'll see like something coming up ; like , " Uh - oh . ; Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " ,
Bro004_1342	We had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . ; They ended up being five fifty . ; So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . ; And more are supposed to come soon
Bmr008_251	um , other ; For the European ; It 's just to allow . ; If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ?
Bmr024_1581	OK . ; Is is Liz coming back , do you know , ; or ? ; I dunno .
Bmr028_1266	No . We have to r ; There 's a difference ; I mean , if you re - ran the recognition , then you just run it ; Right . Right .
Bro004_1415	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; You would think that would fairly trivially ; the training would , anyway ,
Bro028_1137	Right . ; Yeah ; Uh , ; then it would work .
Bmr008_965	Good , ; Bad . ; " How many years did you study English " , ; or , you know , " have you lived in the America in a c an English country before " .
Bmr029_535	I think the main thing is to do something ; to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level . ; And , uh , so what 's different about this processing is just that we 're doing it at a much longer time scale . ; Right ?
Bed009_1084	Would it be highly ambiguous if ; and then there would be another module that takes that um highly underspecified deep semantic construction ; and map it onto the current context to find out what the person really was talking about in that context . ; Well that 's that 's that 's where the belief - net comes in .
Btr002_2833	Mm - hmm . ; There would be a lot of pauses , ; and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something . ; Hmm .
Bed015_1188	Yeah . ; Just means ; Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_665	Not that we were gonna do it , ; but we wanted to know what would need to be done . ; And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . " ; And he We 've given him the data we have so far ,
Bed015_1480	Mm - hmm . ; Now , this is this is assuming you 've already solved that . ; Ye - yeah . ; So it 's it 's Fred and Mary ,
Bmr030_550	Maybe . ; That 's true . ; It 'll ; That 's right . So you really do wanna be using a machine that 's not
Bro022_1136	I don't hav ; I don't ; this is ; I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain .
Bro005_1107	Mmm . ; OK . ; Cuz otherwise , you know , we won't know what things mean . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr009_228	Yeah , but but what she 's saying is , which is right , is le ; combination of two , of energy and derivate ; I mean , let 's start with the ; Before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is we 're arguing that if you take energy uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually there 'll be more energy than when one is
Bmr030_241	Yeah . Instead of the wave file . ; Oh . OK . ; And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1052	Oh , my gosh ! ; So he had to make it look like ; Because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent I i i or on on this particular project . ; Yeah .
Bro016_199	Right ? ; The insertion number is quite high ? ; I know the VAD takes pre care of part of that , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1367	but at least it 'll tell us " OK here we have something that ; somebody that wants to go someplace , ; now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , ; and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed ,
Bmr019_1096	Right . ; And so all our timing was off . ; I 've given up on trying to do digits . ; I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper .
Bmr025_877	I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you could imagine , ; Yeah ,
Bmr028_1539	That 's why we increased the error rate . ; Interesting . ; Actually , I think of cheating as a way to do some work , where you can't address all of the computational tasks . ; Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection .
Bmr011_1076	whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , ; they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk . ; And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1025	Absinthe . ; Well , you know , that 's ; We 've got five processors on that . ; that 's yeah , that 's a good thing
Bro023_1580	But are you comparing with something ; e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again , ; i it ; Uh , when you compare it with the V A D - based ,
Bmr009_1238	Please characterize your accent ? " ; They 're going to answer the same way . ; I guess ; Well , I was not sure that
Btr002_997	Oh yeah . ; or vice versa ; it 's just , uh it 's like I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different , ; Or vice versa , yeah .
Bro021_649	one minus epsilon ; or o is is one plus epsilon , ; or is it one plus ? ; Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two
Bed009_781	A Alan ? ; might , ; at Tuebingen I thought . ; Yeah I d I don't remember .
Bed002_660	That 's that 's the thing I 'm curious ab ; But ; Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the the the slide of data . ; Like do we know from the data wh which
Bmr027_933	People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . ; My , um I was thinking that with the NSA meetings , I 'd like there are three of them , ; and they 're uh , I I will have them done by Monday . ; Uh , unfortunately the time is later
Bed015_1165	s so when we actually ha ; so for instance , um , ; some of them seem more inherently static , OK , ; like a container or sort of support - ish .
Btr002_293	like sometimes it 's just like , " That 'd be hard , so " . ; Right . ; You know , and but and then ofte often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say , ; Right .
Bro005_128	So , ; uh , yeah . ; We have also started feature combination experiments . ; Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together .
Bmr025_939	Right . ; You don't have to ; The transfer function is less errorful , ; yes .
Bed004_536	And it it would do us no good . ; That ; Ah . ; Ultimately .
Bed012_468	Hmm ? ; those three nodes . ; The - d They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive . ; No , there 's No .
Bmr028_1144	Hmm . ; S Yeah . ; Well , of course it was a bug . ; But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty f f It was pretty funny anyway .
Bmr028_919	You know , do you do a supervised adaptation ? ; Right . ; Ye - All of these adaptations ha ; all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking .
Bdb001_1115	Right . ; You look puzzled . ; I I just I don't quite understand what these things are . ; OK .
Bmr026_759	We are doing recognition in both of them . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr016_798	Yeah . ; OK . ; and it will give you his ID . ; Great , great .
Bmr011_1289	Yeah . ; if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus ; um , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , uh , uh , censored choices , ; we don't have the video , we don't and so forth ,
Bmr003_2156	Why two each ? ; Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . ; So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_64	both to get the , um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about ; things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . ; I mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . ; So . Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns ,
Bmr013_239	Hey . ; Yeah . ; and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , uh , non - predictable . ; Yeah .
Bed008_426	What ex um and so either those is true f or false ? ; So ; Uh Uh well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky . ; Uh from the belief - net point of view it is
Bdb001_940	um ; Well , I wouldn't wait for the formats , because anything you pick we 'll be able to translate to another form . ; Well ; Ma
Btr001_2150	Mm - hmm , ; yeah . ; mm - hmm . ; that 's right .
Bsr001_169	That 's that 's really something . ; Very ; what does " solo " mean ? ; Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine .
Bro003_1470	But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something , ; and that 's probably more than we can do . ; Uh , ; but a hundred is a lot .
Bmr005_649	I 'm expect I 'm not expecting ; Well ; Well , not only a word level , but actually ; I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption ,
Bmr007_331	I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1899	Uh ; Mmm . ; I think ; I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones ,
Bmr025_787	and and and put some kind of summary or something ; uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , ; not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . ; But then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live .
Bmr018_768	Um , we would really need , ideally , a transcriber to time mark the you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends of contiguous speech . ; Um , and , you know , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments . ; Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries . ; Oh , MNCM .
Bed015_1196	You know , and I in general it would probably be , you know ; So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were . ; Yeah , basically . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_674	So the ; the MM ; Mm - hmm . ; MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it .
Bmr028_528	I was away for a couple of days . ; So . ; I haven't done a ; We 're sort of in a stage where we 're uh , Don 's going through getting some of the next meetings that Jane s has .
Bro019_1478	They 're available , ; and they 'll be able to get you something , ; so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while ; Yeah .
Bro027_315	yeah , they picked the values from ; Oh , OK . ; OK . ; For r w what test set ?
Bed008_432	OK . ; So for this decision it 's just uh true or false ; Yeah . ; and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want .
Bns001_1232	and ; So Cuz what 's difficult for me is what is meant by " application " ? ; So . Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining " application " in different way . ; So , what exactly is mean by " application " ?
Bed003_552	right . ; That would be a cue . ; what 's the fastest way ; Yeah ,
Bed009_65	Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , ; or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system ; and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse ; uh not parse not
Bmr024_1417	And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference . ; Hmm . ; So ; Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something .
Bmr016_1354	so I don't know . ; I haven't heard it actually . ; Like their hair 's on fire ? ; I n I need to listen to that one .
Bmr002_1391	when you get all this hardware . ; Well , this is , I mean , compared to the way people normally do , like , discourse stuff ? ; you know , it 's like you got your ; I mean they 've gotten away from w reel - to - reel tapes ,
Bmr014_416	Exactly . ; Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , ; And then you ca then you can do a s ; Yeah .
Btr002_1214	and , um , um , ; I 've forgotten Someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it . They could see the the waveform and " Oh , it 's gonna be a seven . " ; Oh wow . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr023_395	um , and e Actually you talked to them . ; Didn't you ? ; Did you ? Have you ? ; Yeah .
Bmr027_300	Well , the form Well , the form doesn't say , if uh , you know , " if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks " ; I see . ; Uh ; Oh , OK .
Bmr007_263	Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to to because the the overlap is , uh on is only the in the final " S " of the of the the fin the the end the end word of the , um previous speaker with the the next word of the the new speaker . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I considered that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an " X " with a and the idea is probably , eh when eh when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh eh , we h we have eh eh confusion with eh eh noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_778	It 's a little bit ; I mean , can you say , like , " The film ran out " ; you know , ; or , maybe you could say something like " The film is out "
Bro011_572	and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits ; Mm - hmm . ; and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . ; Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone
Bro018_414	I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow . ; Oh , he was gone these first few days , ; and then he 's here for a couple days before he goes to Salt Lake City . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2171	No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts for Mari . ; And if Mari 's too busy then ; Mmm . ; OK ,
Bmr010_906	I mean , you know , eh , eh , it 's u ; And the the pronun the pronunciations the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard . ; Do whatever you want . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed015_1453	Yeah . ; Oh , Dutch . ; and , um but very confused background I think . ; Uh - huh .
Bro018_530	but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh a translation to a per - frame feature vector , ; so there 's no sequence in that , ; I think . ; I think it 's just a
Bmr003_1050	Yeah . ; And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here . ; And it 's it 's only our time , where " our " of course includes Dan , Dan and you guys . ; It doesn't include me at all .
Bmr001_105	So I definitely wasn't pausing enough between them . ; This is these are things we will find out . ; That 'll be an issue . ; Yep .
Bns003_580	Pending . ; Yeah . ; See for me it 's the same ; I can also say , uh ,
Bmr027_1007	Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . ; D d So , does Washi - does does UW wanna u do this wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? ; Uh , for recognition . ; Oh .
Btr002_2217	Oof ! ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; It 's very interesting .
Buw001_1175	Less ? ; So , I think ; It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free ; Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on .
Bmr018_474	Cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out , ; but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location , ; Yeah . ; and ,
Bro023_720	So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . ; Ah , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_371	Mm - hmm . ; those could intersect with these ; in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions . ; Right .
Bmr001_273	Certainly you can get some ; Well we could I mean . ; By the time We 'll have we 'll have data so we can actually you know , demonstrate that . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_289	right ? ; It 's whatever you want , actually . ; Right . ; So that what 's nice about the P - file It i
Bmr019_295	it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker . ; Right . So we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr028_1097	Um ; Actually , we 're experimenting with phase stuff now , ; or is that Mathematica ? ; and and , uh , thi this , uh first result he got , uh , was really great .
Bmr021_563	so I assume that 's alright with everyone . ; I actually haven't looked at it yet . I haven't had a chance , ; I haven't either . ; Oh .
Bro014_801	Uh . ; We have to wait for that to fill the whole table , ; but ; OK .
Bro018_1057	So uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning too much . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions
Bmr029_853	I have I have , ; um ; let 's see , um ; Yeah . And if not I can retrain those models very quickly .
Bns002_938	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; uh but ; Oh , sorry ! ; But even if you if you don't have to to worry about eh your power source , you have to worry about your environment ,
Bro022_418	I know in the meeting , like ; On the meeting we have two point seven . ; Right . ; Oh .
Bro008_357	Wha - what about ; i in so the the ; Yeah , ; so there is this , the mismatched is , um the same kind of thing ,
Bro024_885	I think when it 's noisy people should just speak up . ; to ; Mmm . ; So
Bns001_1258	and uh and it 's uh very easy to change it , maybe in the access network , for novel things . ; For instance , that 's one provider domain ; and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain ? ; So it means that packet are delivering information ,
Bmr007_415	even though it may well be you know , if your if your hypothes The hypothesis you were offering eh ; Um . ; Right ? if it 's the null poth hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , we don't know the answer to that . ; The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ?
Bmr024_1126	Good . ; OK . ; What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? ; Um , it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up .
Bns001_268	For instance , that it also fit , maybe , to KPN , and Siemens , and in other companies . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and This probably has to be a brainstorm right now . ; Yep .
Bed013_1448	Or ? ; Um . ; I guess it has to be transcribed , huh ? ; We have uh , eh found someone here who 's hand st hand transcribing the first twelve .
Bmr024_1066	Right . ; And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a good idea .
Bmr014_89	and and I 'm sure help out his own time . ; Mmm . ; by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's ; So , uh in order
Bmr021_775	Where should I start ? ; Uh the ; So there 's a two ; Oh . I tried it with and without .
Bns001_1757	OK , sorry , sorry . ; RSVP . ; and I think we should stop now but please everybody , ; short
Bro027_201	It might even be in a week . ; So , I ; A week , ; Huh .
Bmr003_273	Right , ; but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC ; and what does that mean to what we 've done already ? ; Right .
Bed017_467	and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , ; rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . ; So these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . ; And I think a lot of the even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar .
Bmr009_436	Yeah . ; Uh and I I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some there 's there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed008_751	Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . ; Uh maybe not . ; I mean the that 's the the issue is um ; would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of .
Bed003_1041	theoretically . ; Go Right mouse . ; Open with . ; That 's
Bmr008_1485	Yeah . ; yeah . ; So so I mean , so you know two hundred , three hundred four hundred mill ; some longer chunk of time ,
Bmr011_1832	OK . ; Do you remember that thing that Michael Finka did ? ; that experiment he did a while back ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_525	Then And ; OK ; so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages ; and it and I was seeing that it got worse .
Bmr022_399	It 's not a bad idea . ; Yeah . ; Keep things from getting out of sequence . ; If they heard it over again they would know . It would be obvious from their transcript whether they did that one or not .
Bdb001_687	and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence . ; f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences . ; And another segmentation is in terms of , um , I don't know , prosodic phrases . ; And let 's say that they don't nest .
Bmr020_251	Well , of course , no , it doesn't necessarily go against what he said , ; But ; cuz he said " generally speaking " . In order to to go against that kind of a claim you 'd have to big canvassing . ; Hmm .
Bdb001_612	Right . ; So it 's it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . ; And then each utterance could refer to a turn , ; and each turn could refer to something higher up .
Bed002_448	and it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; In general you 're you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that . ; a This is purposely a really simple case .
Bed013_961	Mm - hmm . ; So what would be kind of cool is that if we encounter concepts that are castle , tower , bank , hotel , we run it through the ontology , ; and the ontology tells us it has um , admission , opening times , ; it has admission fees ,
Bed006_466	Um , did you run into problems or did you run into not h having time ? ; Yeah . ; But not not any time part . ; OK , so that 's good .
Bro012_954	Is it applied all the way back here ? ; It 's applied the ; um on , ; yeah ,
Bro014_195	yeah . It 's , uh ; Shoot . ; I I I can't remember now what happens at that first one . ; Uh , I have to look it up and see .
Bmr027_161	Yeah . Those uh ; NSA . ; OK . I spoke loosely . ; The the German , French Sorry , the German , Dutch , and Spanish ones .
Bmr028_767	Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff . ; And so what I 'm doing is , um , putting in the stream reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files . ; Mmm . ; An - Which is the right way to do it .
Bns001_1347	Yeah , but we have no eh current no public funding , ; No . ; OK , everybody 's paid here . ; Yeah .
Bro010_1298	It 's a , uh , blank sheet of paper . ; So I guess we 're we 're done . ; Yeah , ; yeah ,
Bed006_35	Getting ahead of myself . ; So . ; Um . For those who don't know ; Everyone knows me ,
Bmr031_311	They 're still working out the date . ; cuz they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff ; since they 're going to be doing a bunch of meeting recordings there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_880	Um ; It just depends on your tools . ; I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded , ; Right .
Bmr002_1292	but I really do think from everything that I 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying , ; the information retrieval aspects from that . ; Right . ; And I wouldn't be too surprised
Bed016_1047	It i But it 's a state and the the issue is , is that it may be just a usage , ; Hmm ? ; you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , ; I don't know .
Bmr021_415	Well , is there is there is there a NIST routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices ? ; I don't think so . ; And yeah I mean , that it ; No , no . I mean , if you
Bmr023_696	which we couldn't use . ; Uh , we should use I Ds or something . ; And those don't show up . ; So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person ,
Bmr009_1385	Yeah . ; Oh , no . ; Oh no . ; I sort of thought they were part of the one of the Midlands .
Bmr011_1531	So if anyone has ideas , ; I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people ; but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . ; Well there was this K P F A
Bro022_674	good . ; So they are helping . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's good to hear .
Bmr024_455	Yeah , OK . ; So do ; or stuff like that . ; OK .
Buw001_1412	i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . ; You know , I think inter " interesting " is is non - threatening in ; OK - OK . ; Yeah .
Btr002_104	And , you know , with when you 're dealing with acronyms , ; Wow . ; that 's that 's that shows one of the problems with acronyms . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2642	I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature . ; Where 's the little things that 's supposed to say " transcript L dash blah - blah - blah " ? ; Oh , it 's at the top . ; Yes , you run across that .
Bro023_183	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_937	Right . ; But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on ; Oh yeah . ; No . We always have the original long ones .
Bmr030_329	I see . ; We did all the alignments ; and all the matching and stuff , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_182	Well let 's first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . ; And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . ; So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever ; but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things .
Bmr020_634	And so then you hook that to the phone and go off ; Yeah . ; and do the do whatever you r wanna do , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_1283	It just And we ; because it is easier to have it open ended . ; we might learn from what they say , as to which one 's a better way to ask it . ; But I Cuz I really don't know .
Bmr030_712	I was gonna say I took some a suggestion of Adam 's , ; and I , um , created a m CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if you go to the speech local web page , and then there 's a disk status page .
Bro025_370	Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually . ; So , ; Oh . ; uh , some people are lobbying lobbying to make it shorter .
Bmr002_1387	Wow , ; I 'm just really impressed by this , ; um , yeah . ; It really makes you feel like you 're doing real work
Buw001_1349	because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it ; and then I 'd want to follow up on it . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . That that might get at some of what I was
Bmr016_594	and it 's ; Let 's see , th ; I guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w that the lapel , you know within speaker is bad . ; Horrible ?
Bmr014_161	So we could have up to nine . ; And right now we can have up to six . ; Right . ; And we have five , we 're getting one more .
Bmr018_1151	so ; The which one ? ; I 'm sorry . ; Um , I 'm trying to remember
Bed012_383	Yeah . ; And and if we And if someone says , you know , uh , something in Mandarin to the system , we 'd - wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question , ; So is ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1246	And that worked that worked fine . ; That 's true . ; Yeah . ; Uh , but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine .
Bmr018_841	and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you , ; so , um ; Thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case ; Well it w it would , but , um , we don't know exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin
Bro028_505	Got it compiled and everything . ; Um , downloaded the scripts . ; They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , uh , data . ; Um , so I haven't run the scripts yet .
Bed015_839	because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes . ; OK . ; And that 's also mostly true for read speech . ; In in real speech , um , people may put stress .
Bed003_1293	What do you mean by that ? ; well for instance , the " discourse admission fee " node seems like it should point directly to the ; Uh - huh . ; or increase the probability of " enter directly " versus " going there via tourist " .
Bmr021_481	Physical disk . ; Mmm . ; And it 's conceivable ; I mean , I I don't
Bmr002_299	Oh . ; Yeah . That would be m That would be my fault . ; and , in which case , I thank you . ; Right .
Bns002_252	So none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node . ; OK , ; eh , this problem is what is called ; Oh , sorry .
Bed006_1447	Mm - hmm . ; nuh ? ; So you always send up " here I am I am this person , and I can have these parents " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_564	Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about ; Mm - hmm . ; since I think that 's more important to moving forward , ; but I mean Morgan has this paper copy
Bro004_1272	Yeah . ; It would do badly ; and it didn't so badly , ; Yeah , right .
Bro003_1325	Yeah . ; That 's what I mean . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1186	since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um run with that , ; you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . ; OK . Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry ? ; It would make sense .
Bro004_157	I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess . ; Uh , yeah . ; So um for uh TI - digits for ins ; example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent ,
Bro027_1691	Hmm - hmm ! ; Um ; Wh - uh , the the VAD what ? ; We have the VAD information also available at the back - end .
Bro012_394	Yeah . ; OK . ; But yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement . ; Yeah .
Bro014_776	and somewhat worse for the other two cases . ; Yeah . ; So does , uh ; when you say , uh
Bmr009_47	The @ @ ; Yeah . ; and I uh ; We didn't talk about the derivatives .
Bmr014_721	so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , ; Yeah . ; but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . ; Um if if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,
Bro019_1524	well there is aligned spectral pairs , is like the the ; Is that the aligned s ; It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort . ; Oh , no .
Bmr030_120	Yes , that 's ; I I think ; he ; Right .
Btr002_2218	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; It 's very interesting . ; Enhanced other senses , I guess .
Bdb001_1268	Well , can I ask one question ? ; It it seems to me that , um , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned . ; We 'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the ; And you 're gonna get that
Bro003_2095	Right , ; but during the training , we would train on sigmoid - X ; Oh , you ; Yeah ?
Bmr025_207	It certainly helps . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_274	Oh . ; You should be . ; Hello ? Hello ? ; You should be channel B .
Bmr003_2474	Right . ; right ? ; Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way ; Yeah .
Bed006_1261	Hmm . ; So there 's a bit a redundancy , ; right ? ; in in which the things that go into a particular You have categories at the top under action schema
Bmr014_1155	Yeah exactly ; Oh , ; Sorry transcribers . ; Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how " hmm - mmm - mmm Bill Gates duh - duh - duh - duh . "
Bmr011_510	but I mean but they don't have our block of wood , ; right ? ; Yeah , our block of wood is unique . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_220	And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six . ; Yeah . ; And I asked him and he couldn't tell either . ; Hmm .
Bro026_1039	So so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . ; Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier ; and and and , uh , the phones are ; uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of
Bed006_919	think also that um we can have one or m as many as we want links from from the schema up to the s action um description of it . ; Hmm . ; But the notion I got from Nancy 's idea was that we may f find sort of concepts floating around i in the a action description of the action f " Enter " frame up there that are , e when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the the S Source - Path - Goal schema , ; Exactly .
Bro011_737	Ah ! ; OK . ; Great . ; Thanks .
Btr002_250	OK . ; You know what I mean ? ; Th - if if it was like , " period , capital SO " , as opposed to , um , " That would be a problem , so . " ; Oh , I see what you 're saying !
Bns001_1812	We are done . ; Yeah , just leave them on for now . ; Sometimes if you turn it off while it 's recording it crashes ; OK OK .
Bro005_1267	but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now ; to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed004_349	Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one ; but uh whether the where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether ; Mm - hmm . ; or the " landmark - iness " of where I 'm currently at .
Bmr024_712	Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at UW and so forth really does . ; OK . ; They 're actually talking ; So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ?
Bmr023_50	Uh . ; She can just walk in , I guess , or ; I think ; Yeah .
Bed005_1490	Yeah , I I would like a copy , ; y y yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr020_1701	And i the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech to to one of the channels , ; so . ; Uh - I haven't - I didn't think of of s of this before , ; What can you do ?
Bed013_364	or ; or ; " here 's an idea " , right ? ; That 's what that paper was ,
Bro014_1069	And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred . ; Oh ! OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Two thou two fifteen hundred ?
Bmr015_1043	No i ; but more people than just PDA users are interested in this corpus . ; Yeah . ; OK , then the then I have two questions .
Bed015_169	It 's used shouldn't matter , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; s For sure . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_126	I mean it 's ; Yeah , I mean the equipment ; Right . ; The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything .
Bmr020_999	That would 've taken more time . ; I just wanted to get it so tha So that if you have like " yeah " in a swimming in a big bin , then it 's ; No , no ! ; I don
Bmr005_432	I I don't ; Yeah , but eh but eh I have to study . What will happen in a general way , ; Could . ; So . You had to start somewhere .
Bsr001_1862	Oh , do we ; That 's right . ; Morgan says ; Morgan says thumbs up .
Bns002_1238	In front ? ; Do you have additional information about this topic ? ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro018_53	I mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do yeah , you 'd do something you 'd do energy ; Yeah . ; but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that . ; Uh yeah .
Bmr013_396	Right . ; So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , ; Mm - hmm . ; but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say .
Bmr020_1116	Yeah . ; It makes a lot of sense . ; And in terms of transcription , it would be easy to do it that way . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_972	And ; Right . ; I I I will include too the the the differential de derivates too . ; Yeah .
Bed008_876	OK ? ; And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there ; and maybe that 's all , ; I don't know .
Buw001_1964	Mm - hmm . ; So ; OK . ; Great . That solves that problem .
Bmr023_355	Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event ; and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way ; in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs ; because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh , than the generation ,
Bmr026_874	Because because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , ; Right , right . ; but but uh . ; Right .
Bmr014_978	So it could that the burden would come back onto us . ; So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . ; Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , ; Yeah .
Btr002_680	Mm - hmm . ; I was trying trying to think of this as prior to ; yes , it was prior to the wireless . ; There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless ,
Bro014_1602	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_703	" I 'm I 'm willing to not work for an hour . " ; Because when Abbott 's ; I know you 're willing to not work for an hour . ; Yeah , right .
Bmr010_1121	No . You 're right . ; It 's i it would be too taxing . ; But , um , they 're putting in a lot of ; Yeah .
Bmr029_544	That 's right . ; so there 's no point in not using that knowledge for speaker identification . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1220	Um . ; Mm - hmm . ; And he had some I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA . ; It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff
Bro003_78	The , um , southeast corner . ; OK . ; OK , so would it be easier ; those of you who are not , you know , used to this area , it can be very tricky to get to the airport at at uh , you know , six thirty .
Bro008_576	Should we do digits first ? ; Oh , yeah , digits . ; Oh yeah , digits ! ; Yeah .
Bro005_39	OK . ; Uh ; OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done ; Go ahead .
Bmr018_667	cuz because what he was what I was saying when I looked at those things is it it I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; They just plain got it all right . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_424	I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_459	Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; no , it 's the electronics . ; And they and
Bmr016_1749	they meant " tickle " as in ; Yeah . ; Huh . ; Right .
Bed013_1353	so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology ; so that we can put them into our Bayes - net , ; never change them , ; so we all there is is " where is X " ,
Bmr010_1552	You mean Javier 's ? ; Yeah . ; What do you mean ? ; I I mean , that is is enough is enough , eh , to work well , eh , to , eh , separate or to distinguish , eh , between overlapping zone and , eh , speaker zone ?
Bmr028_1036	Well , you can do You can you can you can do certain normalizations like , you know , gain control , ; Well , I think there 're lots of lots of ways of doing it . ; They 're both picked up in the clustering , I guess . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_990	Yeah . ; OK . ; And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's , ; Yeah .
Bro012_1158	S ; uh d ; So I think that it it would be good ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bro013_466	These are the two ; the mixed , the big signal is for clean . ; Well , I 'm s uh ; There 's
Bro013_309	So , I think , yeah I think we basically gave up . ; Um . Now , actually for the for the Aur - uh ; But ; we do have stuff for Aurora , right ?
Bsr001_1660	Right , right . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro023_969	Instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it . ; If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction in that . ; Yeah , ; but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it .
Bro018_1171	So here 's this other system , which is a lot better , ; but there 's still this kind of ratio . ; It 's something like five percent error with the the distant mike , ; and one percent with the close mike .
Bed002_1264	You know , just pppt ! ; go on and do other things . ; OK . ; Yeah , but uh but the uh This point is really I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state
Bmr022_674	I think it would save them time . ; We have to ask them . ; I think it would help them keep the track track of it . ; Uh uh , again , especially if there 's hundred many hundreds or thousands I still think it would it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files .
Bmr023_200	Well ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .
Bmr021_258	Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all . ; I guess cuz everyone 's been out of town . ; Probably over the summer it 'll be the same ; Yeah .
Btr002_1772	Yeah . ; They don't interrupt you , ; they 're just like , " Well , OK . " ; It 's kind of neat .
Bmr010_69	I beg your pardon ? ; What 's the interesting stuff ? ; Yeah . Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part . ; Yeah .
Bro012_255	which gives you much better results , ; but that 's not allowed . ; But not allowed ? ; Yeah . OK .
Bmr025_277	we have ; Well , that 's a good point too . ; Here 's a here 's a crazy idea actually . ; I don't know .
Bmr030_123	Right . ; I think the problem was that , I was t saying " hit Alt Tab " with the assumption that he knew what I meant . ; Yeah . ; But he didn't .
Bro005_1309	right ? ; So . ; Yeah . ; Well , OK .
Bed013_992	And then , the discourse history can t tell us , " yeah " , or " no " . ; OK . ; And then it 's up for us to decide what to do with it . ; OK .
Bmr008_1424	So that 's why it doesn't add up down ; I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr015_643	Sure . ; a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . ; And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps , ; which is what I wanna do ,
Bmr021_88	Hmm . ; I mean , there 's no problem with that . ; It 's just what Should we get just more Sony ones ? ; I hate the Sony ones .
Bmr024_120	We just sent it to IBM . ; We we sorta spot - checked it . ; I listened to probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning . ; Yeah .
Bro027_49	S sixty - four . ; Uh . ; Sixty - four ? ; Yeah ,
Bed009_237	That person just wants to take a picture , " cuz he just bought film , ; or " that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before " . ; Or " that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something ; and that you usually do inside of buildings " and so forth .
Bro016_990	Mm - hmm . ; Have to do So you you have to do two returns ? ; Mmm . W uh , for two thousand I did . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1779	Well . ; Great . ; Thank you , Jose . ; Thank you .
Btr002_1528	Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out . ; Yeah . I ; Right .
Bro022_430	or ? ; I ; I didn't . ; No .
Bmr018_1083	It really it depends a lot . ; This is just sort of an overall ; So . ; Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech ,
Bro019_1412	By by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at . ; Yeah . ; So , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1260	Or ; That 's what he was saying , ; right . ; He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when ,
Bro025_652	Um , it 's used for end of utterance ; Mmm . ; because , you know , there 's if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of of of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_945	Right . ; But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? ; What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? ; If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter ,
Bro024_568	But this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech . ; So n s So since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with , it 's easier to get a better relative improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_56	Right . ; And in principle I uh I we agreed . ; Mm - hmm . ; We said uh " yeah " .
Bro014_757	OK . ; And then I took this system and , mmm , w uh , I p we put the old filters also . ; So we have this good system , with good VAD , ; with the short filter and with the long filter ,
Bmr006_993	Yeah . ; Context window ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1425	and th they have for awhile , in H T ; Yeah ? ; And you can parallelize the training . ; And run it on several machines
Bro024_1478	Right . ; But did you do that before the thresholding to zero , ; It 's ; or ?
Btr002_2122	Yeah . ; and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . " ; Yeah ! ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2269	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist . ; Not literally what people are saying
Bed012_461	Well , if he doesn't want to go there , even if the Enter posterior proba ; So . ; Wel ; Go - there is No .
Bmr014_1177	if if it 's something that they said , they might ; i i ; I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_553	No . ; I think Dave Dave knows all these things , of course . ; Right . ; An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .
Bmr002_1427	Yeah . ; Good . ; Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive . ; That 's great .
Bed014_1434	Oh , I don't have it this weekend , ; so , tsk don't have to worry about that . ; Mmm . ; DDR , he asked ?
Bmr027_594	OK . ; Yeah . Cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . ; Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it doesn't seem that ; that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here .
Bro023_364	The MFCC baseline is is what ? ; Is at what level ? ; It 's the ; it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it .
Bmr025_613	And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive ; and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . ; Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna ; if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups .
Bmr031_1285	Yeah . ; so they 've been getting from us the , um you know , some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts ; and the also the actually the , uh , transcripts annotated with events , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1802	But it would be still useful for the ; But if both of those are publically available ; Yeah . That 's good . ; But they
Bmr016_1627	Well , then , at least now . ; S s six now , yeah . ; Now it 's at least six times , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1061	Have you ever seen those little ; um ; It 's it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ? ; Yeah , I know ,
Bmr005_1101	So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . ; You say I I I want to use this uh this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . ; So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh gets subtracted off from the original speech . ; Then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense .
Bed014_114	Yes . ; I didn't finish the sentence ; but he understood it . ; I know what he 's talking about .
Bro023_388	And forty forty . ; and ; Forty percent is the high mismatch . ; OK .
Bmr006_61	um , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time ; One offs ? ; Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , ; both to get the , um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about
Bmr011_145	But we have more than one type of ; I mean , for instance , you 're ; Yeah . ; And this one isn't very adjustable ,
Bed002_389	and this is Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , ; there 's gonna be contextual things , ; there 're gonna be linguistic things , ; there 're gonna be discourse things ,
Bro016_866	and and it may be at the very least it may be quite different for MSG than it is for mel cepstrum or PLP . ; So that would be ; So the first thing I 'd look at without adjusting anything would just be to go back to the experiment and look at the , uh , substitutions , insertions , and deletions . ; And if the if
Bed011_536	Yeah . ; So , alright , so let 's go let 's go back then , to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see how we 're doing . ; Yep . ; Do do people think that , you know this is is gonna um cover what we need , or should we be thinking about more ?
Bro021_693	Oh , yeah . ; I actually implemented the Wiener f f fil filtering as a module and then tested it out separately . ; Yeah , I see . ; Oh , OK .
Buw001_1495	So you need to have some sort of ; if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the ; you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha ; Hmm .
Bed003_134	Or one time I was at this ; So " nice walls " is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh significant ; Architecturally appealing from the outside . ; or something like that .
Bmr026_797	Yeah , it 's pretty impressive . ; And And so uh after I told the my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a ; Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . ; Um , and , you know , why not ?
Bro023_1489	Hmm . ; t Oh , this ; but possibly more . ; I mean , if channel one VAD gives you
Bmr022_60	Cuz one of the problems is that it takes a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcriber . ; Yep . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; I 've noticed that . Yeah .
Bmr027_1485	You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous ; and that caused a lot of problems ; Mmm . ; Oh . Right , right .
Bro024_82	yeah , I wou I would be curious about people 's feedback on this ; cuz I 'm @ @ I p I think there are some I think it 's it 's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem . ; I 'm trying to figure out what 's the optimal way to set this up . ; So , um , I 'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page .
Bmr016_1591	That 's not bad . ; Yeah . ; so , anyway . ; That 's interesting .
Bmr016_1248	the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments . ; There 're comments of four types . ; So this is a good time to introduce that . ; The four types .
Bmr010_1068	And so that hasn't been really our focus . ; Uh , we can consider it . ; But , I mean , the other thing is since we 've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps . ; Yeah .
Bro007_540	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; What ? ; Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas
Bmr026_110	I 'm just gonna do it . ; And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead . ; You are going to ; I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits .
Bns002_1558	and they did a lot in this area , also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff and the UCB . ; We still focusing on maybe we can have uh more professors involved ; which are working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff , ; so that the UCB is clustered as one uh partner
Bed013_505	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , th that 's the kinda thing that maybe like , um , the general uh con sort of like NTL - ish like , whatever , the previous simulation based pers maybe you 're talking about the same kind of thing . A general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate . ; Yeah . ; And good to do at some point anyway .
Bmr013_56	Right . ; Um , so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . ; And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , ; um , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that .
Bed015_1514	But wouldn't the " I " then set up the the s s referent ; Mm - hmm . ; that happens to be the speaker this time ; Right , right .
Bmr012_338	The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times ; That that was OK . ; OK . ; and that definitely indicra indicates a bug .
Bmr009_581	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_301	It will miss them . ; It will miss most of the really short things . ; Uh - huh . ; Like that .
Bed011_784	" Costs " , ; " Little money , some money , lots of money " ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Actually , maybe uh F uh so , F
Bro005_669	three million for other , ; and six million for the last one . ; Uh , ; yeah ! As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled ,
Bed014_1008	Yeah . ; yeah . ; So . ; Right .
Bmr021_543	Mm - hmm . ; OK , now and you 're just you 're not talking about the s the X disks the X uh partitions , ; So . ; just the backed up space ,
Bro023_1262	it 's kind of built into that . ; Hmm . ; And and that 's why we have found that it it does help . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_258	Maybe we can think of more things , ; cross ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro018_547	Yeah . ; So for my class project I 'm um I 'm tinkering with uh support vector machines ? ; something that we learned in class , ; and uh um basically just another method for doing classification .
Bro014_1510	because I I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow ; Mm - hmm . ; and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , um , take , um , audio as input , in general . ; So I decided that I I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows
Bmr031_1646	Right . ; Uh , yeah . ; Thanks . ; Sure .
Bmr002_404	Uh , keyboard . ; and they generate keystrokes . ; Oh , that 's totally cool . ; now how how do you how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ?
Bro003_471	And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT . ; And that 's the ; Right . ; and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language .
Bmr010_464	Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same . ; and collections at NIST . ; So ; Yeah .
Bed006_1394	No more qualifiers than that . ; No , this is the useful , ; So . ; you know , don don't worry .
Buw001_2174	Mm - hmm . ; TV stuff , ; radio stuff . ; But he well understands that that 's very different than these this type of meeting .
Bed006_861	but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of ; they 're sort of like action specific roles and the more general Source - Path - Goal specific roles . ; So are we worrying about that or not for now ? ; Yes , yes .
Btr002_1469	So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along . ; Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line . ; Mm - hmm . ; I have to do something visually .
Bed016_673	Yeah . ; Yeah . Right . ; Uh , ; Too bad .
Bmr022_266	That 's a good idea . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Alternating .
Bro005_1163	sort of all over the map . ; A bunch of different dimensions . ; And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have um , the data to train up ; I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this ,
Bmr014_806	Mm - hmm . ; Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . ; Yeah . ; I think everyone in the meeting can access the web .
Bmr012_160	And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wanna talk about recognition results . ; Anything else ? ; I guess what time do we have to leave ? ; Three thirty ?
Buw001_703	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I think you uh , that ; And ; the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .
Bmr010_1338	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_561	So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . ; You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet ; Hmm . ; and then so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects .
Bmr007_104	What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? ; Oh , ; th That 's the per cent . ; Mmm .
Bed013_985	The idea is to say , we encounter a certain entity in a in a in a utterance . ; So le let 's look up everything we the ontology gives us about that entity , ; what stuff it does , what roles it has , ; what parts , whatever it has .
Bro026_59	Have you tried it yet ? ; No , I didn't . ; OK . ; So I I 'll try it today .
Bro021_1245	when I develop this in s Taylor Taylor series , I can't , um , calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the Gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech . ; Now . ; And this is fixed . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_109	there 's gotta be a reason for it . ; And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . ; The context , which in this case we 've limited to " business person " , " tourist " , or " unknown " , ; the time of day ,
Buw001_577	In fact , I often do it . ; Yeah , but those are bigger deal things . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1072	I mean , there are lots of ways of doing it , ; but w but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it , just letting them log in to ICSI might be OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control .
Bro028_396	In fact , you hear some things better than others . ; And so it it isn't ; But ; But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal .
Bns001_635	because they want to ; use current technology with a c a combination of mobile IP . So I think there is a lot of activities in the area . ; Uh . ; And my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here .
Bed014_175	Wh - Which one ? ; The the little Smarticus ; Smarticus sounds like a murderer . ; Oh .
Bro027_763	So . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; So , our ,
Bed010_425	Or will that change ? ; I mean , yeah , ; I can like I c ; Um . This week I guess um , kind of I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free .
Bmr016_1130	I do these checks . ; Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Exactly .
Bdb001_795	Be ; Because here you 're specifying a lattice . ; Uh ; So the underlying that 's the underlying data structure .
Bro013_400	Yeah . ; Uh I designed a new a new filter ; because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds ; and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s
Btr002_1955	Oh g ; and what the heck 's he talking about ? ; Wow ! ; But just sort of just weird things like that ,
Bmr007_187	Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK . ; And and , you know , in contrast , so Deborah d and also Deborah Tannen 's thesis ; she talked about differences of these types , that they 're just different styles , ; and it 's um you you can't impose a model of there of the ideal being no overlaps ,
Bmr021_130	OK . ; Oh , I see . ; So this isn't Sony . ; This is Crown .
Bro026_436	My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it . ; And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , " OK , this much effect " I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . ; You want to change them one at a time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_328	Yeah . ; didn't happen very often , ; there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing . ; I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one .
Bed005_626	So . ; So , Yeah . ; The problem isn't the short ra range optimization . ; It 's the sort of o one or two year kind of thing .
Bmr014_798	So . ; In the meetings so far , yeah . ; Yep . ; But we 're trying to expand this ,
Bro011_37	Yeah . ; So everybody knows what happened except me . ; OK . Maybe somebody should tell me . ; Oh yeah .
Bro027_160	that 's on the far field . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , the near field 's pretty good . ; So wha what is , uh what 's causing that ?
Bro019_1596	And and what I mean in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK ; I ; because it was just a question of quantization . ; Uh , we were just you know , storing
Bro028_180	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Hmm . ; Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , I I I think , the number of insertions .
Bmr002_247	Sure . ; It 's kind of weird . ; Yeah . ; It 's fine .
Bro011_214	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we haven't result until this moment . ; Yeah , sure .
Bro003_759	Where did th where did that come from ? ; Uh , no , Italian no . ; Digits ? ; Italian no .
Bed016_898	And then ; Nnn . ; No . ; What ?
Bmr009_1392	it goes under " Other " , ; definitely under " Other " . ; Well , you know , Pennsylvania has a pretty strong dialect and it 's totally different than ; Pennsylvania
Bsr001_1447	and , uh . ; Even if we don't make any decisions we 'll have a lot of data . ; That 's right . ; But it will be all documented .
Bed012_265	OK . ; The manufacturer . ; I don't see a manufacturer on it . ; Oh , wait ,
Bdb001_1160	You know , ; there 's a zillion things that people might annotate this for . ; And the only thing that is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence , ; Yep .
Bro018_575	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; and then it finds the optimal separating plane , um between these two different um classes , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1134	Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? ; I mean , this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where we are right now . ; OK . ; They 're the expert
Bdb001_101	We say there 's another utterance . ; We don't know what the t time actually is ; but we know that it 's the same time as this end time . ; Mmm .
Bro007_119	Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection . ; Yeah . ; So there are some results here ; For the Italian .
Bro017_513	But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . " ; Hmm . ; So . So there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_164	Yeah . ; You have some histograms , ; Yeah . ; um and uh , they don't look very separate .
Bro004_988	yeah , ; we don't know ; I see . ; So there 's a question of whether you would
Bed017_748	enormous problem in California , ; and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . ; We think we could . ; Anyway . So so But this is a slightly different problem ,
Bmr028_1604	and then two other speakers their microphones went off later . ; Hmm . ; And this is out of , like , seven speakers . ; So out of seven speakers , four microphones Y you know , basically , three three microphones bak basically flaked ,
Bro010_773	and ; what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . ; Is is that right ; Yeah .
Bns001_988	So . ; uh I never was a friend ; But but still a le d it 's a it 's a fundamental ; Huh .
Bed004_772	u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this ; yeah . ; So I y I 'm just just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case , ; right ?
Btr002_1719	I was . Exactly . ; cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it . ; Exactly so . ; And he was like , " Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears
Buw001_561	from multiple people . ; Yeah . ; you can correct me on this , ; but but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop
Bmr019_1940	Oh , yeah . ; I the first time is traumatic , ; We ; Y Yeah ,
Bmr023_859	Right . ; Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . ; So and and ; let me see if I remember what they were .
Bed014_733	Yeah there 's , yeah ther there 's that as well . ; Yep . ; Hmm . ; So .
Bns002_1188	And ; and Miguel , should I should ask you one question . ; Yeah . ; And uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies .
Bmr028_108	Yeah . Did it ? ; And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . ; So there 's a little user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution . ; Great !
Bro003_1331	Carmen , did you do you have something else to add ? ; We you haven't talked too much , ; and ; D I begin to work with the Italian database to nnn , to with the f front - end and with the HTK program and the @ @ .
Bed013_764	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever , neurological neuro neuro - biol su stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2483	Right . ; Yeah . ; and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back . ; You 're kidding !
Bro021_1201	X K C noise . ; Mmm . ; And I can put that this is equal to the noise signal minus ; Well , I put before this name ,
Bro008_240	yeah ; I mean , I think the question is " Is there is there some advantage ? " ; I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . ; But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do
Bed015_653	I thought that that would be something like ; there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing ; Right , OK . ; but they I mean uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way .
Bmr003_1415	Ye - Yeah . ; I mean we 're just gonna have ; Yeah , ; Right .
Buw001_894	That 's great . ; So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . ; Ow . ; And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea ,
Bro017_117	Yeah but you have the same prob I mean MFCC basically has an enormous number of uh insertions . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_835	But this was just I had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do . ; OK and then the other thing I did , was I took Javier 's speaker - change detector acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes , ; and unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's ; the problem is he does it in two passes ,
Bro003_1319	Right . ; Yeah . ; More classes . ; Right , right .
Bed005_153	Interesting parser property . ; um , even if you leave out , um , all all of this . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1446	There there are actually that 's how we started it . ; Yeah . ; And we had different levels . ; Now we have things like " amuse " .
Bmr010_793	Uh . ; Yeah . ; And then there 's mass . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_744	And that 's just a ; uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device . ; You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1068	Yeah . ; OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . ; You won't be able to look at it . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1403	but not completely if they 're often not overlapping and normalized for the speaker ; Yeah . ; or is that not allowed . ; I mean , what 's the
Bmr008_235	because they were " post " their " doc " ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_444	There you go . ; And there 's a screw that you can tighten . ; And then it ; Right .
Bmr016_921	but we can downsample them . ; Right . ; Yeah , I mean ; yeah , I 'm sorry .
Bed002_219	and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling . ; So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , ; um , and ; focus on that object down
Bmr029_324	Right ? ; Right . ; S six hour test set . ; Six meetings . OK .
Buw001_107	Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? ; La - Landay ? ; Landay . James . ; So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk note - taking things ,
Bro023_1204	And ; if we have no , uh , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , um , i the system is Uh , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before , ; even in these cases of high mismatch . ; So , maybe the neural net will help less
Bro026_451	S ; We 're not talking about computation time here . ; We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_497	it 's possible you eh in the eh ; i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro010_1025	Um , ; uh Let 's see , ; um , ; Yeah ,
Buw001_1148	Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So so that was the prosody thing .
Bed017_420	um , what kind of software is the person using , ; which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , ; um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's ; um , which um , which error message was encountered .
Bsr001_1403	We 're gonna make ; And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro007_92	OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good ; Mmm yeah , yeah . ; then we could compare the two and say what was better . ; Mmm .
Btr002_672	In the some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes , ; or what I called spikes . ; Yes . ; I was wondering what that is .
Bro024_722	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; We have f a big im
Bro007_36	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames several frames of features ; Yeah .
Bro024_706	And , uh , ; the summary is like ; OK . ; So there are the other thing what I tried was , which I explained in the last meeting , is using the channel zero for , uh , for both dropping and estimating the noise .
Bro014_608	They 're sort of separate . ; Unfortunately there 's coupling between them , ; which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD . ; Yeah .
Bed002_342	and a source . ; So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . ; So , I thought , " Mmm ! ; Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . "
Bns002_1042	and eh , well , ; u e a ; some multicast protocols have been proposed for this scenario too , ; and , well , they have to deal with the same problems that they 're uh end - to - end routing protocols .
Bmr008_1777	Yeah , cuz I think in I mean , in general F - seek works , ; I I I don't know ; so it 's ; Yep .
Bed006_357	OK . ; OK . ; OK . ; Because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat , or as much as they can , of that phrasing .
Bro016_355	uh , ; Voicing thing . ; voicing detector . ; I mean , what what 's what 's going on now ?
Bmr029_810	And then , ; uh , ; from that you need the from the segmentations you 'll have the list of wavefiles that the short , uh , set is trained on . ; And then you 'll need disk space .
Bro026_96	So the anonymous mechanism ; you you can set up priorities . ; You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . ; OK .
Bmr024_196	And we wanted to avoid doing that , ; OK . ; so we they are transcribing the digits . ; OK .
Bed015_823	Sorry . ; If ; canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is ; and say , " hey , that 's my focus exponent . "
Bdb001_820	That 's why I was trying to figure out what 's the best format for this representation . ; Yep . ; And it 's still gonna be ; it 's still gonna be , uh , not direct .
Bns002_1039	and , using a reactive approach ; I mean , as our routing approach , for nodes that are closer than this practive area . ; OK ? ; and eh , well ,
Bmr008_895	OK . ; Why don't we try it out . and see see what kind of responses we get from people . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr013_835	Alright . ; We funded the experiment with , uh ; also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , ; Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through .
Bmr011_1589	And so that would make sense . ; the the the German was much better , ; I didn't have the context of that . ; Ooo , ooo .
Bro018_890	So , ; OK . ; Let 's go back to what you thought I was asking you . ; Yeah
Bro027_225	we have all those parameters just set as they are . ; So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything . ; So , ; um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data .
Bro004_458	The upper part is for TI - digits ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; and it 's divided in three rows of four four rows each . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_989	" How far is it from here ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; So , ; You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so ,
Bed016_218	of course , I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide , ; so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , ; and um , ; then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg
Bro018_427	Do have Have people sort of stopped going to ICASSP in recent years ? ; Um , people are less consistent about going to ICASSP ; and I think it 's still it 's still a reasonable forum for students to to present things . ; Uh , it 's I think for engineering students of any kind , I think it 's it 's if you haven't been there much , it 's good to go to ,
Bmr018_898	so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with . ; yeah . ; Right . ; And we 'll just have to see how hard that is .
Bed003_302	wait . ; It is . ; because it 's because have the the time of day ; OK , " closed " sort of is .
Bmr022_678	Interesting , ; Yeah . Cuz it , you know , it 's r r ; yeah . ; I guess also even for the transcribers , it 's quicker to load a smaller file
Bro025_476	Uh , ri ; Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . ; Oh , ; OK .
Bed002_462	and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . ; That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding . ; Yeah . S so so the way that might come up , if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , " Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? " ; OK ?
Bed015_375	And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . ; But you know , for now , I mean , ; Yeah . ; But it y y it 's yeah , just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around .
Bmr013_890	well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , ; Right . ; and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . ; And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer ,
Bro003_1443	Mm - hmm . ; je - je - je - je - je check out the results ; and and go that way . ; Oh , yeah , yeah ,
Buw001_1600	So , you just have to let us know . ; OK . ; What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , um , requirements . ; Good .
Bns002_776	m Yeah , that 's right . ; Sorry . ; But first of all it took place RTS CTS , ; and there could be , you mentioned , if it 's still occu if the medium is still occupied by another one , it will be delayed anyway to a randomly time .
Bed006_1738	So I 'm like RAD ! ; Like every time I say it , it 's horrible . ; OK . ; I see what you mean .
Bmr003_1277	More . ; more . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro003_1598	put them back on the new machine , ; but then your slash - scratch is gone . ; So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . ; But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch
Bro022_187	Um . ; And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio ; and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . ; And so that seems like it could be difficult for training ,
Bed004_284	So this issue about you know re - formulating things , ; maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , ; uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , ; but in any case ,
Bro016_1070	like , um ; So , stuff that 's not based on data . ; Stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1622	Who 's talking on Wednesday ? ; Mmm . ; I haven't J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email , ; did he , ever ?
Bed013_269	Yeah . So , it be it it 's an idea that one could n for for example run run past , um , ; what 's that guy 's name ? ; You know ? He - he 's usually here . ; Tsk .
Bro021_783	And when we put the m m the , em , VAD , the result is better . ; And we put everything , the result is better , ; but it 's not better than the result that we have without VTS . ; No , no .
Bsr001_1667	right ? ; So . ; Yeah . ; We may end up having to do that .
Bmr007_1208	Hmm . ; Yep . ; and ; I like that idea .
Bro026_918	So , what are we bringing to the party ? ; I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together . ; Mmm . ; So that 's th that 's the hard thing .
Bmr010_881	Mouth stuff ? ; uh , mouth mouth stuff . ; And then laughter is a is a special word . ; How would we do that with the hybrid system ?
Bro028_531	So , under condition one here it 's ten percent . ; Then under three it goes to sixty - four point six percent . ; Yeah , that 's probably Aurora . ; I mean
Bed003_622	right ? ; the mode . ; OK , and then on here ; So let 's see .
Bro023_834	You multiply the noise spectrum by a factor , uh , which depends on the SNR . ; Oh , OK . ; So , above twenty DB , ; I see .
Bmr022_485	Uh ; I don't know . ; So if there are in the in the hundreds and thou or thousands of these ; Yeah .
Bmr024_133	And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . ; I mean , that 's the crucial part . ; Right . ; And I think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format .
Bed013_524	And Keith and - or Johno will go , probably . ; Will I ? ; When is it and where ? ; Hmm !
Bed003_218	I don't know belief - nets very well . ; Well usually , I mean , you know , N ; If you have N features , then it 's two to the N or exponential in N . ; And they wouldn't look pretty .
Bed015_1326	So . But that that that 's sort of OK . ; The the within the event it 's st it 's still one world . ; Um . ; Yeah , so " cause " and
Bmr012_681	By uh people uh who are not associated with this project . ; It 's human subjects issues , ; Oh . ; I told you about that .
Bmr009_53	Right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction , but uh ; but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at . ; Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy ; and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things .
Bmr031_110	What am I ? ; Is it turned on ? ; There 's no on . ; Test .
Bmr020_1509	but ; Uh , an order of magnitude ; Certainty . ; notion of of how on a good meeting , how often uh , do you get segments that come in the middle of words and so forth ,
Bro023_1162	Yeah , ; yeah , ; the ; Well , I cannot you cannot hear beca
Bed008_304	mm - hmm ; the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes ; uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . ; So each of those
Bmr021_654	It was really straightforward , ; really easy . ; And this is not ; Oh , I 'm sorry ,
Bro017_527	Mm - hmm . ; he got a job uh at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen . ; Hmm ! ; So it 's like professor u university professor
Bmr008_1579	So it 's looking for some periodic behavior , ; and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that . ; Uh - huh . ; For most @ @ .
Bmr011_667	You know , ; Yeah . ; and ; But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two ,
Bmr020_914	Exactly . ; The training ; So that is the training meeting . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_1278	Mmm . ; Hmm . ; And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins . ; And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh , very very good results .
Bed004_749	I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing , ; OK . ; but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out , ; there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do
Bmr023_766	There were a little ; the relative number of ; I think there were a higher number of deletions , actually . ; Oh .
Bmr005_810	by hand . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . ; And , it seems to work ,
Bed016_117	And the same is true for the proposal . ; I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . ; So , um . ; I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it
Bro004_746	So ; right ? ; Any - anyway go ahead . ; Yeah .
Bed006_479	and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words , ; OK . ; but it would have been ; OK .
Bro026_394	I think it doesn't affect it , ; Um Yeah , not better , not worse . ; does it ? ; I see .
Bro022_807	Yeah . ; And actually there 's ; Yeah . ; There 's an uh , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation ,
Bmr010_1150	Yeah . ; You know , there 's also , the e In my mind , ; I think A An - Andreas was leading to this topic , ; the idea that , um , we haven't yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from IBM ,
Bmr027_942	But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available . ; OK . ; I could do it either way . ; I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .
Bsr001_889	No . ; We 've also , uh , s done some of that as , uh , eh , ; Right . ; um , I mean , I have a so small , uh , hacked up system which sort of , for for the Broadcast News determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them .
Bro013_402	because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds ; and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s ; Right . ; I think it 's sixty - five .
Bro008_527	It 's not so easy to find . ; Right . ; But that would be something interesting t to to see . ; Yeah ,
Bmr008_393	So that 's why I want to put That 's why I want to put s " Optional , Age " , ; so that if they don't want to put it , they leave it blank . ; They might lie anyway . ; Yeah .
Bro027_291	Uh , I 'll I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_498	so . ; But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_320	And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . ; Yeah . ; Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . ; Which one did you mean ?
Bmr026_922	And . ; An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's um that the phone set would change . ; Right . ; So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight
Bmr010_369	Yeah . ; Someone else pays him . ; So ; Isn't that great ?
Bsr001_1247	and so if we if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings . ; I mean that you know , that like you said , the fundamental thing is it doesn't have to be this hardware . ; It 's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data ; Right .
Bro014_1129	a a pulse train ; Uh - huh . ; and for unvoiced it 's something that 's more flat . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_846	Yeah . ; So , ; Right , ; so he 's doing a signal subspace thing ,
Bro022_925	but I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a uh , a probability estimated by each one ; No ; and and put them together . ; Yeah .
Bro012_155	Uh , yeah . ; Yeah , at first I had a remark ; why I am wondering why the PDA is always so far . ; I mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the PDA 's there .
Buw001_1328	But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is what was that part that that that , uh , Mari was saying ? " ; Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf " ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bro014_52	I didn't quite get that . ; There 's there 's four and there 's seven ; and ; I I 'm sorry .
Bed014_1344	and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . ; Right . ; But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the ; Well , that 's good . That 's I I I think that should be the the core group
Bro021_1112	we have fixed this equa ; OK . So now once you get that that one , then you then you do a first or second - order , or something , Taylor series expansion of this . ; Yeah . ; This is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s Taylor series .
Bmr021_266	Should we close the door ? ; If you want . ; Oh , I 'm thinking I don't know about the acoustics . ; That 's that 's all I was wondering about .
Bmr008_40	OK . ; So Why don't we do it in that order ? ; OK . ; Go ahead .
Bmr027_537	So , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , ; Mm - hmm . ; but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we haven't given them that . ; Well , so how far do we have to go ?
Bed002_1151	Yeah . ; which is in file format , ; if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made ; and , for example , if if they are in in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t
Bmr009_1082	Yeah . ; I mean , if if you 're in New England , that 's North . ; I agree . ; If you 're i if you 're
Bmr020_324	Uh - huh . ; So , did we all said " uh - huh " and nodded at the same time , ; R right . ; But , even if you take out all the backchannels
Bns002_346	RTS packets can collide to other RTS packets . ; OK . ; So , this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions , ; it is preventing only data collisions .
Bns002_508	Is that right ? ; Yeah . ; So , his transmission is aborted . ; Yeah , but this is typical for MAC layer protocols , you know .
Bed010_1059	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; You know . We ; Yeah .
Bmr025_418	Yeah . ; Utterance . ; Utterance . ; Just marks ?
Buw001_1699	OK . That 's , uh , my question . ; So we 'll give them all sixteen channels ; and ; and they 'll do whatever they want with it .
Bsr001_1324	Yeah . ; It is exactly these things that I mentioned . ; Yeah . ; This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in .
Bed014_1184	So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , ; but I mean obviously like these the the question one , ; since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um run with that , ; you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now .
Bdb001_997	And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News . ; Maybe you could extend the API to , uh , support , uh , like splitting up , you know , conceptually one file into smaller files on disk ; so that you can essentially , you know , have arbitrarily long f ; Yep .
Bmr002_359	and type what I know ; Yeah . ; and then and then at the end do a breeze through to be sure that everything 's correct . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_1	 ;  ; OK , so we 're live . ; OK .
Bro022_262	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; But the other thing is , he 's putting in w ; I was using the word " reverberation " in two ways .
Btr001_238	I mean , I can I can pronounce it ; Huh . ; but I don't know any . ; OK .
Btr002_2665	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; I put " breath - laugh " in the brackets when I don't know whether it 's a breath or a laugh ,
Bmr028_1272	You can actually never , though , really infer what you would get with a different ; That 's true . ; You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that . ; Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem .
Bro024_521	and there 's this thirty - three for the " Station " . ; And so it 's it 's not it 's not actually very consistent across . ; So . ; The only correlation between the SpeechDat - Car and this performance is the c stationarity of the noise that is there in these conditions and the SpeechDat - Car .
Bro018_635	Yeah , I don't know either . ; Yeah . ; S do you get some kind of number between zero and one at the output ? ; Actually you don't get a you don't get a nice number between zero and one .
Bro023_613	the Wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize ; I mean , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the , uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal ; if you have two channels . ; Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal .
Bmr014_818	Well , I don't think I ; there was this ; well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . ; Good .
Bro025_290	Yeah . ; So , right now it 's one hundred and forty milliseconds . ; Rank . ; Oh .
Bed011_1029	instantiate that . ; On the other hand I have to have , you know , ; there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like " Get " plus path expression for , you know , " how d ho how do I get there ? " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_468	Oh , right , right , right . ; And with this with this you 're saying , you are also in that situation ? ; I mean th ; Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment
Bro014_401	Yeah . ; and then , ; uh ; So the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gonna try and do that , but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different .
Bmr013_220	That it 's just ; Sort of less predictability , ; and You hafta ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3324	The number " X " . ; And then do " QUAL mumbled " or " QUAL whispered " or something . ; Exactly . If it 's a manner of speaking , then it 's useful . ; I see .
Bmr015_699	And , ; eh , I have to to talk with y with you , with the group , eh , about the instantaneous frequency , ; because I have , eh , an algorithm , ; and , I get ,
Bed005_1072	E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ? ; So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bro027_797	Mmm ; Yeah . ; So that would be even That wouldn't change this number down here to sixty - two ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_2185	No no visual input at all . ; Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation , ; and other things like that . ; Right .
Bmr006_387	The room is is really , uh , underused . ; Right . ; Uh ; I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .
Bns003_93	I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance . ; You know , I I can I can build , eh , any computer uh you n installing whatever . It 's needed , ; Yeah . ; OK ,
Bro024_572	I do . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So by putting this noise ; Yeah .
Bmr006_460	We 're saying , " Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . ; Is - is isn't that neat . ; Then you 're gonna go home with it . ; It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you ,
Bro026_950	I guess ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't I don't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with the way I 've been looking at it . ; That it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me .
Bro003_623	Yeah , ; I mean ; w I th I think that 's a good idea ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed008_983	Sure , if you want . ; um ; if there 's parking maybe ; Mmm
Bns001_1645	that means higher than layer four , ; or they are on layer f one to l l up to layer four . ; Bu ; And the service people are considering
Bed005_1147	Right ? ; So there 's no numbers . ; There 's just quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs . ; I i i
Bro011_727	e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . ; So . ; Does anybody know how to um run Matlab ; sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output .
Bmr019_1631	there were five non - native speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_688	That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ? ; They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues ; and it 's quite interesting . ; Well , we we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that I mean a little strange .
Bro023_1523	And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile , ; when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate , ; If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics . ; And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case ,
Bro008_100	OK . ; And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that . ; There was actually there was much less of a huge range than there was in Aurora one . ; In Aurora one there were there were systems that ba basically didn't improve things .
Bmr022_290	You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So I think , certainly , doing two beeps is is no - brainer .
Bed009_265	let 's let 's Let 's hear ; Oh ; Well the obvious one would be if if you envision this as a module within SmartKom , where exactly would that Sit ? ; um so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module .
Bed017_90	we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . ; Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy . ; Sorry . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1502	Yeah . ; Yeah . There was just no way to use the energy in Festival , that was ; Hey ! We could use that in the English ; We have to do the English synthesis for
Bro024_803	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Th - That 's true . Yeah ; the c the models are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you 're introducing .
Btr002_1762	cuz you 're very polite . ; Oh , thank you ! ; No , really . ; You 're always like " Well , I was just thinking about this ,
Bns001_124	this is , I think , um , my first presentation . ; Next maybe next meeting I will uh , do a small sketch about uh , my past work , and well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks , so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1803	Yes . ; Oh . You mean the voice quality ? ; The the shift in ; The " doink " .
Bmr022_43	Hmm . ; But it 's not easy to do , ; because the whole thing gets offset , ; and basically , it 's assigning the wrong speaker to the text , and it all gets unaligned .
Btr002_2995	Mm - hmm . ; just to set it aside , ; have some sort of a length indication , ; and sometimes I 'll even put them in a in a separate bin ,
Bmr019_1116	Oh . ; And that 's I mean , I I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff , ; I would jus ; because I because I looked up in some books and I found OK , I wanna find a spurt in which
Bro021_290	If it if if the peak value 's above some threshold , then you add the noise ? ; Or if it 's below s ; I systematically add the noise , ; but the , um , noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak .
Bed003_1026	Oh man , ; I didn't n Is there an ampersand in DOS ? ; Nope . ; Just s l start up a new DOS .
Bns002_426	OK , ; OK ? ; and then he try to forward this data . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_362	So . ; How about ; It 's you know his " Optional " is not really boldface , but ; How about " optional but highly desirable " ?
Bns001_716	What I 'm trying to say is that is that well , uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert ; because uh I I don't see it I think that the UMTS thing is more a technology issue , than a research issue . ; Maybe I 'm wrong . ; Just es
Bmr027_747	OK . ; You can use spread spectrum . ; you know , with a with a two hundred bit thousand bit , uh ; Uh - huh .
Bmr025_723	and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . ; OK . ; OK . ; So i if you take notes it 's a great little device .
Bro024_184	and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more . ; So ; I don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech ; Huh .
Bro019_83	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Why don't you start with that ? ; That 's sort of
Bed010_385	Uh , it may be free to academics . ; Like I I don't know . ; I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded . ; OK .
Bmr018_366	They could choose any signal to look at . ; I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed . ; But I 've I 've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't , ; Oh .
Bmr026_1248	Yeah . ; So . ; Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2310	We we give people a list of digits ; and they have to like put them into their discussion , ; Uh . ; like say , " Five , one , seven , seven , three . "
Bed010_688	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Mm - hmm . ; He 's he 's very interested in that .
Bmr016_1807	If we make a spelling correction to their name , ; like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled , ; and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , ; You can correct it .
Bmr006_1202	Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; That 's a good thing to consider .
Bmr012_451	Well that 's those are the only we ones there are , ; yeah . ; so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of ; Yeah .
Bed003_1823	Yep . ; Looks like it . ; So what 's " Economics , the fallacy " ? ; I just randomly label things .
Bed003_590	OK ? ; I 'm a big fan . ; it 's starting to grow on me ; and it 's night .
Bmr019_36	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_583	So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there ; and if it gets an unambiguous ; Oh , ; oh . I see .
Bmr019_1140	and so I ; Actually ; But tha that 's good to know . ; Was thi it 's Chafe ?
Bsr001_1459	So ; When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though . ; Right . ; So they 're gonna s say , you 're you 're having a meeting to do this .
Bsr001_336	Wow . ; No . ; Yeah . ; Just studied phonetics in general .
Btr002_2060	Yeah . ; Never changes . ; I 'm gonna check out outside to make sure that we 're OK with the , um ; Oh , OK .
Bmr020_1337	and we send it to IBM . ; Yeah . ; The other one is we just run his thing and send it to IBM . ; There 's a a another possibility if we find that there are some problems ,
Bed006_1707	Not just that you want to go from here to here , ; it 's that the action is what you intend ; Yeah . ; and this action consists of all com complicated modules and image schemas and whatever .
Bmr010_1377	the to speech - nonspeech as ; I think with ; Ah . ; it 's only speech or it 's it 's it 's nonspeech .
Bmr018_352	Yeah , that 's actually true . ; Yeah , you 're right . ; You 're absolutely right . ; Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes .
Bmr027_1040	Uh , OK . ; Um , next one . ; Um . This was an interesting one . ; So the original was " So that 's not so Claudia 's not the bad master here " ,
Bro016_830	they are not ; No . ; no . ; OK .
Bro022_479	OK . ; Yeah . ; So was that was that everything , Dave ? ; Oh .
Bsr001_2459	a ; it 's like but from one to one to nine digits . ; They vary from ; One two three four .
Bed005_176	so if I do this now , um , you can see that it parsed the wonderful English sentence , " Which films are on the cinema today evening ? " ; But , um . ; Well , that sounds ; Uh do don't worry about it .
Buw001_1200	Um , there 's very little allocated for him ; and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . ; So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , ; query generation , that sort of stuff .
Bed014_595	Um ; Well , uh , is it doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a a thread , that you know , kept track of ho of the activity of ; I mean , cuz it would the the thread would know what nodes like , needed to be activated , ; so it could just keep track of how long it 's been since something 's been mentioned , and automatically load it in .
Bns002_157	Yeah . ; maybe the batteries are uh exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh , let 's say , any sun to recharge its cells , ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_681	this has gotten ; I mean wh ; We don't need the words to that . ; Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today .
Bmr019_429	but ; I mean , mine are too . ; E th everybody 's ears are too big for these things . ; No , my my But this is too big for my head .
Bro023_1423	Yeah . ; Yeah , but that has a variable latency ; because the last frame doesn't have any latency ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_664	Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte . ; So , the real case ? ; However you know , it The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities ; but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer .
Bed016_1135	Yeah . ; So , if we 're not talk about the lexic ; Location versus what ? ; instruction .
Bed005_1325	right now . ; The reason is , given the craw bet uh , the the the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history , they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects , ; and that 's , uh , uh , sort of a tough cookie , ; a little bit tougher than they figured .
Bro017_962	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , the sharper the variance , the more more important to get that one right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_295	correcting the boundaries . ; You shouldn't have to tighten them too much because Thilo 's program does that . ; Should be pretty good , ; yeah .
Bro018_640	Um , uh ; there are there are pap ; Well , basically , it 's it 's um you you get a distance measure at the end of the day , ; and then that distance measure is is um is translated to a zero or one .
Bro003_1677	Um . ; So , I guess , ; yeah , th the other topic ; I maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the for next week 's meeting .
Bed003_1276	the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . ; And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that . ; Yep . ; And so forth and so forth .
Bro011_210	modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . ; to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . ; and we have some the feature for Italian database ; and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result .
Bed013_49	and the other bit of news is we had you know , uh , I was visited by my German project manager ; who A , did like what we did ; what we 're doing here , ; and B , is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in August , to actually work .
Bro026_972	right ? ; We go all the way down to phonemes . ; Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1580	Yeah , this is totally like ; The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . ; We need to look at all of them . ; I mean but , they 're even like I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc .
Bmr019_600	I mean , what 's where do we go from here ? ; I mean , ; Yeah . That was gonna be my question . ; we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well
Bro003_161	So , uh , what 's been going on ? ; Why don't we start start over here . ; Um . Well , preparation of the French test data actually . ; OK .
Buw001_263	Although ; Yeah . ; W ; And and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking ,
Bro023_654	I see . ; OK . ; So ; but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have .
Bmr031_553	They 're not going to . ; Uh . ; You 're gonna have to just get ; Interesting question .
Bed006_187	that 's what I suggested to him , that people like like Jerry and George and et cetera just ; Yeah . ; advertise in their classes as well . ; Yeah
Bro021_812	I have an idea . ; If if , uh , uh , ; y you 're right . ; I mean , each of these require this .
Bro028_1038	but but but , uh , Hynek has . ; Um , ; but it 's also , uh ; Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction
Bed005_1206	Eh well to some ; No , no . ; So , " Noisy - OR " is a funny way of referring to this , ; because the Noisy - OR is only one instance .
Bro023_409	Uh , ; and again , that 's the ba the ten point , uh , four and twenty point one . ; That was with on - line normalization and LDA . ; So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it .
Bmr025_988	" Ha - ha - ha - ha . " ; Well dear . ; Um . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_826	I just ; but I couldn't remember all of it . ; It ; So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going ,
Bmr011_1336	You mean in terms of the topic topics ? ; Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things ; and , uh , just dialogue - wise , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_201	Oh , not too much . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , one day or less . ; Hmm .
Bro007_340	and then um if we can um ; Mmm . ; oh yeah also when when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ? ; I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?
Buw001_1020	Oh . ; That could be very interesting . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_2225	It 's fine . ; It 's fine . ; One or four . ; I don't care .
Bns003_155	you know . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; you download it , if that s must be possible from the network ,
Bmr005_1167	and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really ; uh ; Well , do we have that much ? ; Not really .
Btr001_573	You guys didn't have o one channel per person before ? ; Mm - hmm . ; No . ; No , it was one like one ribbon for everybody
Bed016_168	But , anyway . ; um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d ; Oh . Oh , sorry . ; OK .
Bmr006_919	Ah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and ; Bad .
Bed003_577	What should I observe ? ; Just se set a few of them . ; You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . ; Just like uh , maybe the fact that they use a certain verb
Bed006_709	Uh one question , Robert . ; When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ? ; Yeah . It 's the shadow . ; OK .
Bsr001_680	Uh - huh . ; right ? ; You 'll dump the the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere ; Yeah .
Bro017_71	Yeah . ; Right . ; right ? ; I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy .
Bmr008_56	And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , so that you can distinguish them , ; and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form . ; And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background . ; And we could do profession , but it 's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level .
Bro026_20	What was the update ? ; What was the update ? ; Yeah . ; So there is th then the all the new features that go in .
Bro018_1104	And um the I tried that with HDK , ; the Aurora setup of HDK training on clean TI - digits , ; and um it it helped ; um in a phony reverberation case
Bmr025_448	yeah . ; Seat ? ; Great . ; Sea - yeah .
Btr002_3112	It was just very quiet , ; like kind of under the breath kind of thing , ; Uh - huh , yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr020_983	it I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together . ; That 's fine . ; OK . ; But what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends um are actually close to the speech inside of that
Bmr024_1275	maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females . ; Huh . ; And so , um , you know , I 'm open to suggestions . ; And it is true that the , uh that the you know , we are using the
Bmr013_486	So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , ; and then ? ; Well , regular dictionary , I mean , this is a pretty rich dictionary . ; Or would we
Bro011_530	I mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , ; uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data ; but it 's it 's not ; I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this
Bed002_958	Right . ; n No one is , at the moment . ; Right . ; OK .
Bns002_1489	So you know already what partners are included . ; OK I didn't have a look at uh slides , ; Um ; yeah
Bed004_908	Um , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside , ; Yeah . ; but ; OK .
Bed004_128	No no no . ; We u Wait . ; OK , good question , but uh ; you you just wait and see .
Bro019_1071	and uh , ; that we have uh , for the uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually . ; It 's the far field mike . ; And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things .
Bmr014_1169	Yep , yep , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I don't know .
Bro022_875	an upward slope . ; Yeah . ; So having some kind of a ; uh , you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,
Bro021_1160	Uh - huh . ; And what are you using for the noisy ? ; Y y doing that strictly ; Of the noise
Bed006_534	OK . ; It Just a mail that , you know , he 's sending me the the the stuff soon ; This is being sent , ; mm - hmm .
Bro015_19	Yeah . ; That 's cool . ; There you go . ; Right .
Bmr011_371	Uh - huh . ; Well Dan Dan had worked on that . Dan Ellis , ; uh , based on ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_1139	I don't think so . ; Right . ; Well , see , I 'm thinking " Where are you from mostly " ; Oh , OK yeah .
Bmr011_146	I mean , for instance , you 're ; Yeah . ; And this one isn't very adjustable , ; so this about as good as I can get
Bmr020_429	It 's It 's ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_250	Tony Robinson ? ; Tony Robinson ? ; Do I mean Tony ? ; I guess I do .
Bro011_96	Hmm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And the third point um was the um , ; yeah , the on - line normalization where ,
Bed011_1166	Then you can go . ; I mean I I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment , ; but it probably is . ; OK .
Bro012_1381	We need labels . ; Well . Cuz we don't have ; Why not ? ; Well , for Italian perhaps we have ,
Bns003_224	I I think it doesn't ; It is not worth to discuss it now ; because nobody raised it before . ; Yeah ,
Bed013_1121	Exactly . ; What is the uh ; Well ; And then given that we know that the construction has these two things , we can set up probabilities
Bro003_119	and it 's it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there . ; Oh , I ; So that leaves us fifty minutes before the plane ; it 'll just
Bmr014_221	Uh , I don't know . ; I don't know how much of it 's public . ; Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff . ; Right .
Bed010_236	Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing ; That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say " this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it " and stuff like that . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr001_3	OK , so we 're live . ; OK . ; Are we live or are we Memorex ? ; We 're somewhere in between .
Btr002_2069	but , um , ; Mm - hmm . ; Good , thanks . ; I would leave here ,
Bro026_499	Maybe they can be little ones . ; Right . ; Cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based , uh , TRAPS , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between ; Mini - TRAPS .
Bro011_555	this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system . ; So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features ; and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . ; So look at the difference there
Btr002_1758	Right . ; Yeah . ; falls apart . I don't know . ; I like transcribing you
Bed005_872	If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there 's no obligation on any of this . ; So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that .
Btr002_681	I was trying trying to think of this as prior to ; yes , it was prior to the wireless . ; There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless , ; which was , um , mechanically bad in some some sense ,
Bmr010_880	Mm - hmm . ; Mouth stuff ? ; uh , mouth mouth stuff . ; And then laughter is a is a special word .
Btr002_3272	I tried to do it with the numbers ; and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems , so I stopped it . ; So that 's probably why you , like , added in that , um , thing that automatically puts in the people 's initials . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_250	Right . ; I think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile ; because the recording situation is so different . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1236	Mm - hmm . ; M I mean , it 's it , um ; The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean ; but then you get a different noise .
Bro014_1160	Oh . ; Yeah . ; I 'm sorry . ; So , you know , all
Bro019_1287	and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise ; but not much on the TI - digits . ; So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . ; That 's it .
Bro018_373	I don't know . ; Well , maybe somebody 'll think of something , ; but this is uh ; It may just be that they they want to have for very small energies ,
Bmr009_706	Great . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks ,
Bsr001_927	it 's a lot easier . ; Yes . ; I think there are some programs in TV . ; I 've been trying to get this from something like this from , you know , public cast
Bmr003_792	OK , that would make a difference . ; Mmm . ; But , um ; I mean , it 's not bad
Bmr001_46	Um , I have no idea which one I 'm I 'm on . ; I 'm ; Oh one ! ; You 're on one .
Bmr014_542	know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses ; Right . ; then cuz " neural nets " and oh she has some things that are oh " downsampled " , she got that right . ; Hmm .
Bro021_1091	That 's true . ; OK . ; But this this is correct ? ; Sure .
Buw001_1884	Right . ; But it 's obviously very different material . ; It 's not spoken material , for instance , ; Yeah .
Bmr010_925	and , um ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; OK .
Bmr013_186	And it 's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So .
Bmr024_477	So , you can you can ; Yeah . ; It 'll give you a lot more data , too . ; Won't it ?
Bed003_1696	see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . ; And I talked to Liz about this ; and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . ; So who would be the subject of this trial run ?
Bed006_1783	yeah . ; And intentions will be " RID " ? ; Like , ; " OK " .
Bro008_175	So , ; um , so that 's a nice feature of what what we did . ; Um , ; but , um , well , we still have to see how it all comes out .
Bmr030_340	right ? ; Right . That 's the same software I used to get the data . ; Yeah . OK . ; OK .
Bmr031_156	And I haven't told you ; cuz I haven't I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet . ; Right . ; But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline .
Bed003_1256	Hmm ? ; Is that it ? ; However these are of course then ; the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer .
Bed014_638	And so it could be that when another uh , en tourist entity gets mentioned , you ; Renew ; re re essentially re - initiali you know , re - i essentially re - initialize the state . ; Mmm .
Bmr024_462	So . ; So that should be possible . ; I mean that shouldn't be a problem . ; Uh , so that was the one thing ,
Bmr009_1410	Let 's just ; Yeah . ; And we 'll see what we get . ; We 're all sufficiently tired of this that we 're agreeing with you .
Bro003_909	But , but , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time . ; So . OK , so that 's your training corpus ,
Bmr015_1181	we didn't have convolutional errors , ; we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , ; and moving your head ; and all these sorts of things ,
Bed016_980	I 'm con ; you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using " Plato , " ; Yeah . ; and you can refer back to it ,
Bro023_1288	so uh , ; It 's amazing how often that happens . ; Um , ; so this is the first thing .
Bed005_415	I think it 's actually That looks like it 's state modification . ; Oh . Oh . ; e mmm ; Um , well i
Btr002_300	Yeah . ; Yep . ; You know , but I never usually put period and then new word " so " unless it 's like , end of the sentence and then , " So . " ; " What are we gonna do now , "
Bed011_1080	But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of uh of analysis , ; you know , these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the " Out of " construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something . ; Correct . ; Oh yeah yeah .
Bed004_478	Well , let me think about whether whether I think we can present this to them or not . ; Um , ; Uh , ; Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc .
Bmr009_463	cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel . ; Mm - hmm . ; And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1781	we know what what kinds of features help with it . ; Hmm . ; You can throw something in . ; You can do pretty well .
Bro027_173	Uh , and there 's also the , uh uh , air conditioning . ; Hmm . ; Which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1240	mm - hmm . ; And they and they capitalize like every single first ; I really th ; Yeah .
Bsr001_807	So . ; I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Buw001_856	and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . ; s ; Uh , except in ; er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost . Right ?
Bmr027_1177	We have actua actually I have ; W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , I was I was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , ; Oh , OK . ; Sure . No problem .
Bed010_968	Uh ; Someone from the class ? ; No , ; interestingly enough .
Bed003_419	Yeah . ; Normally context will include a huge amount of information , ; but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess . ; Yep .
Bed006_308	and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay ; for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI . ; So he 'll he 's around seven seventy years old , or something . ; I didn't know he was the founder .
Bns002_1256	or let 's say , boys and something like this . ; Yeah , but nevertheless , you have the range of ten meters , or of one hundred meters . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but you know , uh in fact
Bmr025_162	On which tool ? ; THISL . ; The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK ; Yeah .
Bro016_218	Oh , you oh , you don't know . ; OK . ; I don't have this in ; I 'm sure it 's more balanced ,
Bed016_902	" Bakery " can't be something you 're gonna eat . ; No , no . The question is d do you wanna do you wanna construe do you wanna constr - strue ; Sh ; It 's a speech - act .
Bdb001_903	you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , ; Right . ; or or something like that . ; They 're not gonna be at the phone - level and they 're no not gonna be at the frame - level when we get done with sort of giving them simpler shapes and things .
Bro025_449	Mmm . Well , we can do the frame - dropping on the server side ; or we can just be careful at the terminal side to send a couple of more frames before and after , ; and So . ; I think it 's OK .
Bed006_878	or in this action schema , ; there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure ; and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching , ; but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're
Bmr016_1135	Yeah . ; Thank you . ; And so , uh , I do a an exhaustive listing of the forms ; Actually , I will go through this in in order ,
Bro026_38	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So right now nobody 's working on Aurora there . ; I see .
Bmr028_1208	Hmm . And ; Well , the and the other thing is , it takes only a a minute to rescore all the old outputs with ; If you had new transcripts , then we j we just re rescore the old ; Right . Cuz you haven't done any training .
Btr001_1530	But they 're very fast . ; It 's uh ; Well , I ; I definitely prefer not doing the transcript
Bro023_593	which could be due to the word pattern . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; And Yeah , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real VAD .
Bmr006_1184	Oh . ; No . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one ,
Bmr016_1692	is that " to be " or " not to be " . ; Yeah . ; Oh that 's cute . ; There 's no tilde in front of it ,
Bsr001_2348	But but there is ; but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on ; To always ; yeah .
Bed009_1072	uh ; The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera , ; and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take . ; Provides , they claim , a very powerful , general notion of deep semantics .
Bed013_765	Yeah . ; The fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever , neurological neuro neuro - biol su stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I guess four pages you could
Bro012_1242	Mm - hmm . ; um ; But the thing is that you can't ; given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information
Bed013_511	Well , I I also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months , we we we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected , which could happen , doesn't hurt ; Mm - hmm . ; because it 's something we eh ; Having it is still a good thing .
Buw001_2016	It 's just ; I just wanted to uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3163	it was set up for a different purpose , you know . ; Not necessarily so phonological . ; I agree . And I think there 's another problem too , ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1626	So , ; uh ; Have you done digits before ? ; No .
Bmr023_1146	So wha w what an and you may not be in this case , ; come to think of it , ; because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . ; So , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training .
Bmr008_892	OK . ; OK . ; So it 's just in the section talking about language . ; OK .
Bed004_680	Object type , ; mm - hmm . ; So that 's ; but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through .
Bns001_611	I see . ; so . ; Yeah ? @ @ ; Nokia research .
Bed006_465	wonderful . ; Um , did you run into problems or did you run into not h having time ? ; Yeah . ; But not not any time part .
Bmr013_506	they they I thought that they were ; Is that what they 're doing ? ; They are . ; we should catch up on what Steve is ,
Bmr011_1447	No , no . No . ; If that 's not the case then ; So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group ; but even there he hadn't
Bmr014_541	But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you ; know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses ; Right . ; then cuz " neural nets " and oh she has some things that are oh " downsampled " , she got that right .
Bed006_1531	Yeah , pastries is what I 'm talking about . ; Pastry ; oh ba oh the bak bakery example . ; Bakery .
Buw001_1124	Well , I mean , ; so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? ; I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , ; Mmm .
Bed002_1201	and what it does , and how it does that . ; Well , y Well , or both of them speak . ; Sure . ; We don't care .
Bro010_503	Uh . ; um , ; so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , ; and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR .
Bmr027_296	Right . ; Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already if ; Uh , the f ; so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify .
Bro027_1043	And so , ; uh , ; they felt they wanted to set a limit . ; So they chose sixty .
Bro017_425	I know , I know , ; you know , huh . ; and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife . ; And she 's very pretty and he loves her
Bmr016_573	like it 's not the speaking style that differs , ; it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . ; And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , ; which you would expect
Bed015_506	what is in the future , ; where is this , ; what is here , ; what is there ,
Bmr020_990	OK , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; so what is the sort of how tight are they ?
Bmr014_191	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But we 've had more problems with that . ; Yep .
Bro007_348	Alright . ; It 's not clear here . ; OK . ; Maybe maybe they 'll argue about it .
Bmr008_1524	Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it . ; Right . ; And so I think that would be ; And he has on his graph something like forty percent .
Buw001_377	and he 's looking at the query in in ; i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff ; but we have zero hours of of of queries . ; So he 's just sort of going " where where do I where do I start ? "
Bmr019_1304	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1423	Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary . ; And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab ; and it goes on to the next unit . ; Hmm .
Bmr019_1212	but this time you know where the other people start and end talking ; you know , where their spurts start and end . ; And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were . ; Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps .
Bro017_201	Right . ; Because you already uh had the noise uh in a ; And it was working at the time . ; It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but
Bed003_731	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what 's interesting is when it 's not when it 's set to " unknown " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_983	Yeah . ; Uh . And . Later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1792	So in other words this data collection is more general . ; but since ; It could it could be used for not just this task . ; It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur ,
Bmr007_1301	Yeah . ; Does it take ; Actually actually I I thought that 's what you were giving us was another meeting and I was like , " Oh , OK ! " ; Thank you .
Bro004_957	because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings , ; and OGI show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence ; Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . ; I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after .
Bro024_304	So it 's within speaker , ; g s ; Yeah . ; within phone call ,
Bed003_476	Um " nice walls " is binary , ; " closed " is binary ; " final destination " , again ; Yeah , all those are binary I guess .
Bed003_874	from that point of view . ; Huh . ; OK . ; Let Let 's do a
Bro004_1093	This is ; Oh . ; Anybody know any ; There it is .
Bdb001_292	So that what 's nice about the P - file It i ; Built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure . ; And then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values . ; Oh .
Bro024_519	and then there 's a minus five percent for the " Babble " , ; Mmm . ; and there 's this thirty - three for the " Station " . ; And so it 's it 's not it 's not actually very consistent across .
Bro017_533	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm ! ; And he well , he was hoping to work uh with Ericsson like on t uh like consulting basis , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_314	There you go . ; I guess when I read it , um ; OK . ; I 'm not as diligent as Chuck ,
Bro019_1443	yeah . ; Yeah . ; And uh . ; Yep .
Bed010_444	Right . ; Right ? ; I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of ; Well there there there There 're two different things you do .
Bro024_1536	I should have gi given other results . ; Also it 's clear when you don't add noise , it 's much worse . ; Like , around five percent worse I guess . ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_197	Yeah . ; Yeah , so let 's s uh s see I th I think that from one point of view , Uh , um , all these places are the same , ; so that d d That , um in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , ; so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us .
Bmr023_808	Yeah . We get twelve of those , ; huh ? ; Yeah . ; But the PLP features work um , uh , you know , continue to improve the ,
Bmr008_1147	I see . ; but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting , ; yeah . ; Yep .
Bns001_97	Where uh , you have a set of , uh , mobile nodes and , no other infrastructure , ; no base stations . ; So all the routing functions are done by the node by the same nodes . ; OK ?
Bro003_244	OK . ; Uh . ; Well , nnn . ; But I 'm not sure
Bed006_1230	Action schema . ; Right . ; What are some types of action schemas ? ; Well one of the types of action schemas is Source - Path - Goal action .
Bmr003_1259	We 'd like to . ; Well ; Unfortunately ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1120	Oh actually it 's not that weird ; because we have seen ; We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1100	or some XML examples ; Yeah . ; yeah that would be that would be nice . ; and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week .
Bro022_812	because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , um , starting of speech and end of speech uh , at the utterance level . ; And ; Um . ; With some some gap .
Bmr026_456	I 'm also using DG ; I got that confused . ; three or four meetings . ; OK .
Bmr008_1670	I think also the harmonics would be very important . ; So if you can find voiced regions and ; Yes . ; You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing
Bsr001_1650	Right . ; right ? ; You 're not intending to do any ; You said you weren't gonna planning to do any beam - forming as such ,
Bed015_2190	So ; I would suggest as soon as possible . ; Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ? ; N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us .
Bro027_1775	to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . ; Speech . ; But I mean , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? ; Well , yeah .
Bns001_159	Or if you have something or if somebody has some slides , o or articles , whatever he wants to be published there . ; Yeah . ; Then everybody sees the structure , how it is uh , structured really structured . ; Yeah
Bmr022_864	So we could ; Yep . ; Yes , absolutely . ; OK .
Bmr012_1338	but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK .
Bsr001_1412	Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's quite an interesting issue . ; So that 's something we should try to
Bsr001_734	to put as much power as you can in the PDA . ; Yep . ; OK , ; uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary to do it
Bmr019_1876	Oh . ; Crunchy frogs . ; Um ; Chocolate adaptation .
Bed015_1901	If we knew anybody like that . ; Right , ; " who might want " ; et cetera .
Bro017_524	Wow . ; Where 's uh Guenter going ? ; Well Guenter is already he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_535	Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ? ; Exactly . Yeah . ; Might be , yeah . ; And I guess , see , the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei
Bro021_1316	Twenty ? ; So it 's ; Yeah . So it 's actually forty numbers that you 're getting . ; Yeah , maybe maybe you don't have a
Bmr002_786	OK . ; Oh , ; this is , ; I see .
Buw001_1889	But it 's p it might be ; But but that 's actually what I wanna do . ; OK . ; That 's that 's what I wanna work with ,
Bmr026_44	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; So they 're just doing their own thing until ; Because I I need to ask Jane whether it 's it would be OK for her um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .
Bro024_595	The first r spreadsheet is TI - digits . ; Mmm . ; Hmm . ; How does clean training do for the , uh , " Car "
Bmr016_446	I 'm mean I think it 's doable , ; The poor transcribers ; I 'm just ; they 're gonna hate us .
Bsr001_1159	because it 's in the future , ; but , you know , sequentially maybe thousands . ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bro026_940	Um , ; anyway . That 's my thought . ; OK . ; You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually .
Bmr003_745	boundary . ; We haven't decided which which time we care about , ; and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like you have the option to put in more or less timing data ; and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is .
Btr001_1965	a little bit of break away from that ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; because it 's hard to sit there and li see like , " But , don't you see h you 're being rude to this person , you 're cutting off this person
Bed010_534	Um . The uh Well I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack . ; I mean , the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment , ; Oh , OK . ; but this is a a three language project : German , English , Japanese .
Bmr029_939	Sorry , Robert did what ? ; Robert took what ? ; His laptop where , uh which we used for the SmartKom data collection , for the synthesis . ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_1703	um ; I d ; um ; yeah , for this I think we can maybe try to train the neural network for voice activity detection on all the data that we have , including all the SpeechDat - Car data .
Bmr023_269	So for them it 'll be very quick ; Yeah . ; to to put those in there when they 're transcribing . ; So , um , we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting ,
Bed017_78	And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again ; Maybe it 'll take some more time , ; to be realistic , ; but at least we 're we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there .
Bed011_923	Well , yes . ; Both . ; OK . ; Uh , and Though for us , constructions are primarily semantic ,
Bro017_617	Mm - hmm . ; which is , like , " imagine that you will you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power . ; In some what ? ; General pow power .
Btr002_2711	Right . ; You can see the little little peaks , which is interesting . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_641	Yeah . Or you can run into an old friend , or run . ; Well , you can " run into " in that sense too . ; But , uh , ; Yeah , " run into " might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense .
Btr001_1984	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; there 's definitely a sense of persona . ; You definitely get an image of
Bro019_836	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; so we can ; So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing
Bmr024_1609	I think , uh , probably , uh , Adam and and , uh , Chuck and me should talk about should get together and talk about that sometime soon . ; Over a cappuccino tomorrow ? ; Yeah something like that . ; Um , uh , you know , maybe maybe we 'll involve Dan Ellis at some some level as well .
Bro024_1071	No . ; They actually changed the compression scheme altogether . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they have their own compression and decoding scheme
Buw001_2271	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , I think ; Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . ; Right ?
Bns003_441	yeah , ; So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page . ; that 's a ; We have the we have the directory structure , of the real UNIX tree . in compliance and in accordance with what you with the structure of the web pages .
Btr002_3327	I see . ; Right . ; And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better . ; OK .
Bmr020_1528	So I mean does one of the does it mean one percent and ten percent ? ; OK . ; Or does it mean five percent and fifty percent ? ; OK .
Bro014_1584	Mm - hmm . ; or a ; Um , I was thinking more like using them as as the inputs to to the detectors . ; or a feature or something .
Bed008_1034	but , you know , directly out of interaction . ; Right . ; Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . ; Yeah .
Bro003_934	Yeah . ; But the the Aurora Spanish , I mean . ; Oh yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1594	At the same time . ; Please . ; At the same time . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_232	We have ? ; Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet . ; Oh . ; Oh , OK .
Bro010_1234	Yeah . ; The oth the other thing , uh , that Dave was talking about earlier was , uh , uh , multiple mike things , ; uh , where they 're all distant . ; So , um , I mean , there 's there 's all this work on arrays ,
Bmr031_551	How in the world are they gonna ever distribute this ? ; Yeah , distributing ; They 're not going to . ; Uh .
Bmr020_1254	So how will we know who ; Huh - uh . ; S ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2240	I don't think we talked about that in particular ; cuz we didn't we haven't done any pilots , ; we haven't seen this , incredibly difficult data of overlapping . ; But this is
Bsr001_1040	So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ? ; Uh , ; I , you know ; There are no final
Bmr024_456	So do ; or stuff like that . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro003_894	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not .
Bro022_13	and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . ; It was very very believable schedules , too . ; I mean , we went through and with the schedules and we ; It was true for two years .
Buw001_1881	Well , that 's the idea . ; So that that that would be a source of text which is supposedly got the right vocabulary . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed003_1458	I don't know if ; I thought there was a line that went from somewhere , ; maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago , ; but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort .
Bed009_953	um ; Yeah and here 's the case where the English and the German might really be significantly different . ; In terms of if you 're trying to build some fast parser and so forth ; and
Bmr027_775	Forward but backward . That 's right . ; No , it 's backward - forward . ; Good point . ; A point .
Bmr012_572	Well we 've done that for one meeting . ; But you know ; so . ; For forced alignment .
Bed015_1843	Yeah . ; which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ?
Bro022_1230	Mm - hmm . ; Is that it ? ; OK . ; OK ?
Bed005_939	Right . ; Not precisely what we want , ; and that 's that 's wh where it it gets difficult . ; And I I don't pretend to understand yet what I think we really ought to do .
Bro026_460	Uh - huh . ; So with this , uh , new stream would you train up a VAD on both both features , somehow ? ; No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features . ; OK .
Btr001_2095	Totally . ; You know , someone just leaves , ; you know , ; gets coffee ,
Bmr006_355	Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that ; Yeah . ; So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . ; You may say well , " Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . "
Bmr012_817	You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance . ; Hmm . ; So in other words ; Right .
Bmr029_557	Um . Yeah , I guess . ; But , um , ; I also think that a again once we got into it , that , um , using some kind of clustering would probably work reasonably well there , too . ; Certainly for the the two microphone case ,
Bmr031_474	I I I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion with them . ; OK . ; I d I don't think it 's like , i uh , they 'll ask us , we 'll give a simple answer ; and come back .
Bmr028_210	Well , actually the audio files are pretty fast , too . ; for presentation in , uh Uh I wouldn't be ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_728	So remind me of what well - matched meant ? ; You 've told me many times . ; The the well - matched is like ; the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .
Bmr031_528	literally . ; I don't think that 's true . ; Really ? ; They 're recording fifty channels of mikes .
Bed016_856	It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones forward ones to defend , ; so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro012_1131	Yeah , well , not pitch , ; but to look at the um fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum . ; Yeah . ; So . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound
Bmr013_590	Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , ; Interesting . ; as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . ; Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system doesn't work at all .
Bed012_258	The crown ? ; What ? ; Yeah , ; versus " the Sony " .
Bmr007_53	OK . ; They 're , you know ; So . ; Um , So , uh so , I 'll go through that .
Bed002_1065	Mm - hmm . ; And it and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . ; I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , ; and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already ,
Bsr001_1525	No , no , ; we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece . ; OK , OK . ; That 's good .
Bed009_796	They w They had There were This was done with a two phase thing , where the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid ; yeah , also ; and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context . ; Right .
Bmr028_132	Sorry this microphone 's moving around . ; I can't put this over my ear . ; It could Do you have to put it in your ear ? ; You c you clip that part over your ear .
Bmr008_20	I should have brought more ; What did we have ? ; Yes . ; uh You you were announce some things
Bro012_786	This is a plot of C - zero , uh when we don't use spectral substraction , ; and when there is no on - line normalization . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2221	good . ; Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this . ; So , we it 'll have to be convention . ; What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ?
Bed003_1755	But um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further ; Mm - hmm . ; but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard , ; and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe .
Bro017_270	uh twenty percent correct . ; Hmm . ; You know , ; on on like for the frame by frame basis ,
Btr002_453	I I sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses , ; Yeah . ; see if I can do it just by itself , ; but it it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque ,
Bro027_169	but but we thought it wasn't a bad thing . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , that 's a nice noise source . ; Yeah .
Bro012_318	so ; but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations ; and then they built the silence model ; and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures
Bed015_2118	And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , ; that once you ; we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , ; so we write it down .
Bed003_615	OK . ; That all you want ? ; Yes . ; OK .
Bro022_695	f s ; um , ; but use the SRI system instead of HTK . ; That 's
Bed003_674	Yeah . ; but I 'd like to see more . ; Not because it would expedite the probabilities , cuz it wouldn't . ; It would actually slow that down tremendously .
Bro016_770	Well , it 's tandem features , ; so ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1622	Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . ; Yeah , really . ; I mean , they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker I mean I I ; Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity .
Bmr009_1046	Well and what and what 's Northern ? ; I think originally it was North Northwest ; Northwest ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1260	but the two thousand 'd be faster ; so ; Right . ; I actually have to go .
Bed011_149	Around four - ish . ; And um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . Um behind our backs . ; But ; Well , there are these uh uh
Buw001_2169	Of course it 's not " found " in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . ; Yeah . OK , OK . ; But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , ; That 's interesting .
Bmr020_772	so that when they did experiments they could compare . ; Right , ; but they don't have a recognizer even . ; Yeah .
Btr002_802	Yeah . ; T Yeah . ; and , you know , press the button and " juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh - juh " . ; Hmm .
Bed015_1623	Mm - hmm . ; Um , and it 's sort of in an extended function ; Mm - hmm . ; So we would have it be in quotes in English .
Bmr016_690	Uh , I 've actually done some experiments with cross - correlation ; Well ther there 's ; and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1428	and ; and um ; and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh use novel things ; and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network .
Bmr014_1128	Great . ; Um . ; So I guess I probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . ; I 'm not really sure what 's best with that .
Bed011_221	Now of course you have this I guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff , ; um but I guess I 'm I uh m my temptation is to go for simpler . ; You know , less variation . ; But I don't know what other people think about this in terms of
Bro025_730	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Just to see where where I could start off from , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_304	In addition t ; it is because we we we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT ; and yeah . ; and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence .
Bro003_2018	but let 's say that they were ones and zeros , ; then y and you know for each , ; um , ; I don't know if you know this for your testing data ,
Bmr016_1103	Alright so , first of all , um , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures ; and and I can tell you first , uh , to go through the steps ; although you 've probably seen them . ; Um , as you might imagine , when you 're dealing with , um , r really c a fair number of words , and uh , @ @ natural speech
Bmr018_1571	But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together . ; But they ; Right , right . ; Sure .
Bed017_574	The idea was there . Yeah , OK . ; uh to to exploit FrameNet there as well . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro024_916	Mm - hmm . ; So they add a random random noise to it . ; To the just the energy , or to the mel uh , to the mel filter ? ; No .
Bmr029_458	Oops . ; Yeah . ; We we simply wanna determine what 's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close . ; OK .
Bmr011_861	So , um , I corresponded briefly with him . ; I , uh , c I ; He still has an account here . ; I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , uh , transcription . And he and he did .
Bsr001_1773	So so ; Oh , the ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr018_1598	yeah . ; So it depends a lot on whether , you know , it disambiguation is exactly the case where more data is better , ; right ? ; You 're you 're you can assume similar distributions ,
Bmr016_2025	I see . ; So this is where Chuck 's , um , overall h architecture comes in , ; where we 're gonna have a master file of the channelized data . ; Um , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses
Bmr005_1364	Well ; Yeah , who knows where they are . ; Have they ever responded to you ? ; Nope .
Bmr005_1063	It 's good good to sort of test them , actually . ; And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . ; So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . ; Um , there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b
Bmr010_201	Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bro019_1291	Wait I I 'm sorry ? ; Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum , ; just the baseline . ; Yeah ?
Bmr025_580	But ; y yeah . ; Well I 'll turn off the screensaver too . ; Yeah .
Bro021_9	Yeah . ; You want me to run it today ? ; Yeah . Why don't you run it today ? ; OK .
Bro014_117	Uh , I I have to look to see what the exact numbers were . ; Yeah . ; I I thought was , like , three , two , two , five , ; but I I 'll I 'll double check .
Bro003_1163	Well . ; Running on what ? ; Uh , M MFCC . ; No ,
Bro019_1391	you know burst ; or noise , uh , frication , ; that kinda stuff , ; um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events ,
Bro004_1033	I asked Hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . To get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . ; Um And , he didn't think they had ,
Bro017_1114	It 's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the uh distance measures . ; It might be that uh ; Yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1291	One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much , uh things could be helped by more parameters . ; And uh And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have , in terms of the uh computational limits . ; Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters , ; particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse ,
Bsr001_2244	uh , Christine Helverson , who 's working on this with me from the s um , aspect of user , you know , usability and stuff , would , y you know ; sh she 's interested in these sorts of things . ; What what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load , um , that can help things out , ; or , you know , those sorts of issues .
Bed013_307	Like I ended up at Blakes last night . ; Non - conducive . ; No . ; I almost got into a brawl .
Bmr012_1180	right ? ; No that 's uh ; you need a transmitter . ; What ?
Bmr023_990	for the tandem . You know , ; so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing . ; So so , the thing is is do we expect ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1729	If you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system , and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff , in principle , but you still need it , is eh not aligned . ; Yeah . ; We have it for different islands ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bmr013_614	That 's great ; And I could And ; for me . Yeah , so . ; Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did .
Bro018_1084	um ; Wanna ; That 's as far as my stuff goes , ; What 's what 's on
Bmr016_306	Oh . ; And they can have , ; I mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . ; In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth .
Bns001_128	Thank you . ; So , thanks , Miguel . ; Yeah , we m discussed it yesterday that you 'll maybe will have a talk next Tuesday ; Y
Bro018_149	Right ? ; I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough ; or maybe there 's something else that that one could use , ; but I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here ,
Bmr015_391	See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years ; and that they have a fair number of them . ; Um , ; and the large ones are ,
Bro019_919	first of the colo colored noise ; Yeah . ; and then make the noise white , ; Yeah .
Bro027_273	yeah . ; OK . ; And so I haven't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr028_1299	but it it allows As long as you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference , it gives you credit for that . ; Th - what I thought . ; Alright . ; So it does a it does a word alignment , like you have to do for scoring ,
Btr001_519	That too . ; Yeah . ; Or just ; I don't know .
Bed008_709	so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro019_462	Yeah ? ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So
Bmr030_271	Yeah . ; There 's a median filtering and then there 's a piece - wise linear fit , based on some criteria . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1110	Yeah really . ; And if you put ; We could ask where they 're from . ; It 'd be pretty simple , yeah .
Bmr031_999	Should help with the transcripts . ; Right . ; They wer so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous . ; Right .
Bmr020_1900	right ? ; Are we gonna do it altogether or separately ? ; So ; What time is it ?
Btr002_2834	There would be a lot of pauses , ; and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Btr002_800	where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually , ; Ooh , interesting . ; Yeah . ; T Yeah .
Bmr020_193	OK . ; I mean I get these AARP things , ; but I 'm not se really senior yet , ; Right
Bro019_1456	So that 's that 's only thing I have ; and Diane has a few more houses . ; She 's going to take some pictures and send me after I go back . ; OK .
Bed017_606	Yeah , yeah . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of of students , really , ; and w we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams . ; Yeah , I know . ; Mmm .
Bmr008_558	I I there are huge differences you know in the others ; what ; Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down . ; so it might be better to just do it for the
Bmr023_854	um , uh than ; Than you do with the standard ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent .
Bns003_472	Yeah . ; Yep . ; And the stuff itself is , uh , located at our server . ; In our directory .
Bmr031_730	and ; I guess I need to talk to him more about ; Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even , ; and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions .
Bmr011_297	I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . ; I forgot to do it . ; So . ; Yeah , OK .
Bed015_1435	If you haven't read it . It 's nice . ; And just pick any paper on alternative semantics . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bro012_51	even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , ; but it 's ; What 's the cut - off frequency it used ? ; Oh .
Bmr019_1673	It 's Morgan 's fault . ; You can find ; You can find , uh , problems with with the transcripts , ; It 's always Morgan 's fault .
Btr002_62	and , um , actually what I meant to say was um , " so you 're saying groups of different sizes , ; different size groups ? " ; Whoa . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1075	But , yeah . I I I have noticed that I 'll screw some stuff up , like , when I 'm trying to get re - adj ; S so which t ; But just the beginning . ; I I 've forgotten which one is which .
Buw001_1231	or or a deeper ; Yeah . ; Or or just a memory refresher . ; I mean
Bro025_582	Mm - hmm . ; But , um . ; Well , I don't know . ; What what do you , uh what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ?
Bmr027_375	I mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . ; Mmm . ; OK . ; So maybe , uh , I you know , that 's not that many people
Bmr009_668	like You should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel . ; Yeah . ; Then you 're gonna w have a wash . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_337	First of all , eh , this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism , ; so it is not connected with routing eh , anyhow . ; Then , fine . ; And , second point ,
Bmr003_2567	So again , Washington wants to equip a system . ; Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC . ; However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_329	but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Bro019_542	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But u u ; Sorry ,
Bmr021_884	so . ; Um . Anyway . So right now what I 'm doing is um ; Uh well , there 's several things going on . ; One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features .
Btr001_1714	Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro023_657	but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have . ; So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions ; and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF . ; So sometimes that becomes zero
Bmr029_163	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; So We - Yo - So , one thing I was wondering is , did you already do that middle one or should we re - do that one , too ? ; No . I didn't do that ,
Bmr028_1495	And so that was important to know as a baseline . ; And and then , once you knew that , then s you go " well , now how do I know that that 's noisy ? " ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr031_1470	Um , but Jeremy 's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side . ; So we have all these waveforms , ; and he 's been with Morgan 's help and , uh , Dan Ellis 's , I think , looking into spectral tilt a bit , ; so he can talk about that .
Bmr016_2286	Mm - hmm . ; The cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial . ; Yeah . ; I mean as long as it can all be done automatically , I mean , then that 's not a concern .
Bns001_1187	Yeah . I ; So why I wasn't , ; well , yeah , uh hold myself back a bit with comments , is uh cuz when I left the discussion , the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point , here . ; And so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now .
Bmr009_916	I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to . ; Alright yeah , I was comparing ; so th this is So I was looking at the change first . ; So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi with reference to this .
Bro024_920	On - only to the log energy . ; Only ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bmr025_732	and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? ; And um I think that was one of the things , ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bdb001_328	But it 's been used here ; But it 's been used here ; and people 've ; and and , you know , we have a well - configured system that you can distribute for free ,
Bro023_361	that When I said thirty percent improvement it 's like MFCC baseline . ; So so ; so what 's it start on ? ; The MFCC baseline is is what ?
Bns001_1233	So Cuz what 's difficult for me is what is meant by " application " ? ; So . Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining " application " in different way . ; So , what exactly is mean by " application " ? ; The application , for instance , here , that eh the interactive classroom .
Bro003_519	so it 's ; yeah , ; so I was just wondering if the fact that TIMIT you 're using the hand - labeled stuff from TIMIT might be confuse the results that you get . ; I I think it would ,
Btr002_628	where the volume 's too high , or th of course when the volume 's too low , ; but that 's a different problem , ; um , except for those cases , it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear . ; I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way .
Bmr003_1700	the the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers . ; They just ; It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two . ; Right .
Buw001_559	no longer than two minutes , ; Adam , you can ; from multiple people . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_392	Right . ; So , it 's hard to know ; It involves retraining and it involves a ; Right .
Bmr011_317	Um , yeah . ; What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech in . ; But that 's not working at the moment . ; OK .
Bmr014_481	Right . ; So it sounds good . ; And so anyway , the clean those are those things ; and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format .
Bro014_946	Yeah , but ther more obvious is that ; Yeah . ; The the more obvious is that that ; well , using the th the FFT , um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean .
Bmr003_2462	The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is is is a non - starter . ; Yeah . ; That I I don't think that 's gonna work . ; I see .
Bmr006_1546	So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . ; On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . ; However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . ; Right .
Bro019_1548	but it was just LPC , ; and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , ; And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , ; sometimes they 're not .
Bro017_927	Right . ; Yeah . ; You would have to modify the mean in the model . ; I you I agree with you .
Bro017_876	Then you divide it by four and you take a square , f fourth root . ; Then if you think that some component is more is more important then th th th it then then uh uh i it is , based on training , then you uh multiply this particular component in the model by by by ; You 're talking about the standard deviation ? ; yeah .
Bed004_463	Um ; and ; So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ? ; " Eh - eh - eh . "
Bmr001_17	this is eh meeting number one with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock uh in the afternoon . ; A range of microphones . ; Yeah . ; What 's this one here ?
Bns001_1449	And if you have the building blocks identified , what is really necessary for QS eh QS - in - Advance for for mobile systems , then you have , in principle , the ideas for the following generation what you could improve . ; Hmm - hmm . ; Because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing . ; I believe the same applies for Multicast .
Bmr028_233	You know , just take f ten minutes instead of an hour and a half . ; Yeah . Th - that 's what I did for for my talk . ; Oh ! Oh , you 're downloading a whole meeting . ; Yeah .
Bed012_929	Yeah . ; And goes upwards ; until you get the ditransitive construction . ; And then , of course , the c I guess , maybe there can be the
Bro027_414	presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the in the production system , ; and , ; um ; Hmm .
Bmr007_621	Uh ; Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1075	And they 're independently they they are events which have very different characters as far as Source - Path - Goal whatever . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; So when you identify Source - Path - Goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be a desire , whatever , eating , hunger , ; whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in in nice ways .
Bed011_647	What kind of activities ? ; Eh , just meeting people , basically . ; Oh ; " I want to meet someone somewhere " , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the " EVA "
Bro004_173	And so , remind me , ; the multilingual stuff is just the broad data . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_1042	or we could also think about , ; uh ; Well , I I I ; How about " I 'm in a hurry " ?
Bed002_605	So , the the the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be ; Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , ; but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , ; given
Bed004_288	Yep . ; um , the linguistics students and stuff . ; So my idea on on Wednesday is partly to uh ; you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine .
Bro023_169	Hmm . ; But do you really want to calculate the mean ? ; And you neglect all the silence regions or you just use everything that 's twelve seconds , ; and
Bed011_804	whatever ? ; OK . So ; S so I think there are a variety of things in which um ; Tour - tourists really do have different styles eating .
Bmr011_1053	So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . ; And so that every every speaker has the same cuts . ; And if they have speech in it we run it through . ; And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through .
Bmr013_696	It you know it really depends on a lot of things , ; Yeah . ; but , I would have maybe a transciber , uh , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_720	Right . ; the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones . ; The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study ; what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech .
Bmr029_334	Four that you worked with ? ; I think it 's ; Is it the same set as the alignments ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_1403	It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_331	So , this is , uh , really ; uh , uh , uh ; My suggestion is really simple . ; We start with , um
Bmr030_285	I mean , so , if you 're doing a piece - wise linear , you have to figure out how many pieces you want . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Sure . ; And so there 's a trade - off
Bmr015_1080	And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts . ; You know , like , Don 's been writing scripts ; and and , ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1087	Yeah . ; And so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , um , t to import the ; Where are those annotations coming from ? ; Well , right now , I g Jane would would
Bmr007_367	So the question is , you know " are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person party " . ; Let let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across . ; And and there well may be , but ; What what I what I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too i too imprecise .
Bro011_738	OK . ; Great . ; Thanks . ; Yeah .
Bro017_998	It would be quick . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1596	Don't you think that KPN could be convinced to go on this way what I mentioned before ? ; There 's no way ? ; No . ; They needed definitely , in principle , some kind of service or device or product or whatever .
Bed005_561	And , uh ; However , the , uh e So that you understand , it is really simple . ; Uh You you have a route , ; and you cut it up in different pieces .
Bmr015_844	I I mean I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it , ; and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , ; but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that ; Yeah .
Bmr020_480	Yeah . ; So , the the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second or or actually , several second speakers , um start their " interrupts " , as we call them . ; Three words from the end . ; At pause boundaries .
Bro004_947	B b including the features , yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't think this will work alone . ; I think it will get worse
Bmr020_1425	Adjusting the gain ? ; No , getting the coefficients , ; for each channel . ; Know what numbers .
Bro024_1109	Wait a minute . ; I think I 'm confused . ; Well ; OK .
Bro026_424	Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , probably . ; Some kind would be good .
Bro003_219	That 's really funny ; isn't it ? ; I mean cuz th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone . ; Telephone .
Btr001_1547	I kinda miss it . ; Excellent . ; Uh - huh . ; I liked
Bmr023_1194	Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it , ; Yeah . ; but actually Stephane did it ; and and and it helped a lot .
Btr002_2663	it 'll be three d sort of separate units as opposed to I think it 's sort of one coherent thing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_322	I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers . ; But just take the best case , the well - matched uh , German case after er well - matched Danish after we ; Mm - hmm . ; the kind of numbers we 're getting are about eight or nine uh p percent error per digit .
Bmr016_0	 ;  ;  ; And we already got the crash out of the way .
Bmr020_195	but I 'm not se really senior yet , ; Right ; but ; Hmm .
Btr002_2188	Right . ; And you get so much more aware of all of it too . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_796	Yeah . ; You can do that if you want . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed004_571	This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some some form , ; and have this be in a in a in the content , ; loosely called " Constructicon " . ; And the rules we want to throw away completely .
Bmr005_223	So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you . ; I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? " and so on . ; Lawyers . ; And so I so I 'm I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh
Bed013_1207	Is - uh , ; Yeah . ; Because , you know , mmm people have many ways of asking for the same thing , ; Yeah , sure .
Bro018_21	And I 'm trying two MLP , one one that only have t three output , ; voice , unvoice , and silence , ; Mm - hmm . ; and other one that have fifty - six output .
Bro004_57	OK . ; So uh I also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail I think from uh from OGI ; and we 'll go go through them also . ; So where are we on on uh our runs ?
Bmr021_202	I mean , the Sony ones are expensive ; because they 're proprietary , ; so they can charge whatever they want . ; Oh .
Bmr031_532	They 're not recording all fifty of the array . ; They 're they 're cooking it down , ; Yeah , they are . ; Yeah . They were g they said they were gonna record @ @
Bsr001_862	Uh , Switchboard . ; Oh , OK . ; Switchboard and , uh ; I I
Bro015_113	Yeah . ; Right now , Sunil seems i is in India actually . ; Right . ; Uh so there is no progress apparently from their side neither .
Bro026_789	I I could send him an email . ; Well , yeah , to add or maybe wh ; I I know him really well . ; I I was just talking with him on email the other day actually .
Btr002_2694	Yeah . Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . Exactly . ; Right . ; And it 's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well .
Bro022_929	Mmm . M Yeah . ; Something that that I 've used in the past is , um when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . ; And you make your decision when the derivative is increasing for so many frames . ; Then you say that 's beginning of speech .
Bsr001_384	And you get dogs to d cock their heads and stuff . ; Yeah it is , ; I ; yeah .
Btr001_297	cuz I ; Huh , that 's really interesting . ; Oh , that 's fascinating . ; Huh .
Bro003_1098	I mean , it 's just running the data through ; Oh . ; Well , you gotta do the KL transformation , ; But wh what about a net that 's trained on multiple languages , though ?
Bmr010_1295	Uh , I mean , there there 's two suggestions , really , ; which is , uh what we said before is that , ; Mmm , ; yeah .
Bmr009_36	So . This time the form discussion should be very short , ; right ? ; It also should be later . ; OK .
Bed017_472	OK . ; And so some of the I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , ; I Are you ; Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it .
Bro024_1710	Mm - hmm . ; and , if you say I 'm I 'm with my envelope ; I 'm close to this noise estimate , ; Yeah .
Buw001_292	I 'm gonna do something . ; I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization . ; And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , ; but it 's not gonna be me .
Bmr026_585	It 's not bad . ; It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S ; Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? ; Yep .
Bmr030_613	Yeah . ; I assume that you can send them anything that they can access with HTTP . ; Huh ! ; Well , they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they 're transcribing , anyway .
Bmr011_180	Well , however many we can plug in . ; OK . ; You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three . ; Mm - yeah .
Bns001_1132	cuz the I mean I found the classroom inside ; but , the thing where I left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever . ; So . ; Now we are talking about something which is much more precise
Bmr013_870	but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , ; Mm - hmm . ; or Pi - uh Tcl TCL I mean . ; It 's like
Bmr026_217	a and in yeah , in terms of of the source code . ; You you can't find the Tcl files anymore . ; Ah . ; It 's some whatever wrapped thing
Bro023_1335	OK . ; What if you just look into the past ? ; It 's , uh , not as good . ; It 's not bad .
Bmr028_755	Um , what what , uh ? ; We have a kernel on Popcorn , too . ; Right . ; That 's very good .
Bmr006_403	Right . ; And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert . ; Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . ; Yep .
Bmr015_753	You know , y you actually say that here is ; Let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency , ; and and , uh , ; Yeah .
Bro027_1408	Yeah . ; Right , ; it 's the It 's ; Right .
Btr002_2753	Yeah . ; Yeah , there are some where ; Yes ! ; Oh really ?
Bro005_1159	We have a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions , ; and then uh in yeah , that and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , ; and noise type ; uh , and uh , uh , channel characteristic ,
Bmr015_244	actually this is maybe a little side thing . ; Um , I I sent to what I thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to , ; It was . ; which was " M MTG RCDR hyphen joint " .
Bmr008_899	Anyway . ; And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is " List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . " ; And that 's just and open - ended place for them to do . ; Oh .
Bmr024_1177	Uh ; That 's good . ; Oh . ; Mmm .
Bed006_482	OK . ; but this this is I guess good news , ; and the uh the time ; and especially Bhaskara
Bsr001_1578	but I don't know what 's the idea for the computer interaction . ; I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ? ; Wizard of Oz . ; OK ,
Bro014_1406	Maybe we can do that . ; Mmm . ; Hmm . ; The spectral subtraction is being done
Bed006_825	Yeah , ; the So ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_646	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but but uh ; Yeah .
Bed014_1157	Part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there , ; incl including the questions ; We didn't we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis in in uh , the semspec . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_29	and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . ; Uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio ; and it 's , uh , about nine DB . ; Hmm .
Bed017_581	right ? ; Right . ; with that FrameNet base . ; Mmm .
Bro022_507	You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , ; and he 's really got something . ; Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? ; Ex - exactly .
Bmr012_302	Yeah . ; It it had no effect on my transcription , ; Yeah . ; you know , I mean I I had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins
Bmr014_725	I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . ; I mean , so it 's it 's ; I mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , ; you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I
Bro027_937	But it 's worse . ; On the highly mismatched condition . ; On the highly mismatch . ; Yeah , I
Bed011_74	Yeah . ; Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates . ; Yeah . ; Um you can look at this if you want ,
Bmr023_498	Yeah . ; Um , we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July , ; and I think it w it 'd be ; Yes .
Bed014_825	Uh . ; Anyhow . ; Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it 's Robert 's . ; I 've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions ,
Bmr028_394	That 's great . ; Did you actually look through your transcripts ? ; Or you just approved them all . ; Uh Well
Bed014_1442	Hard to It 's like karaoke , but for dancing , ; and they tell you what ; It 's amazing . ; It 's so much fun .
Bmr011_383	I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; No ,
Bmr014_970	we have ; Yeah . ; there 's a problem with it . ; So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen .
Bmr025_791	Right . ; And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , ; Yeah . ; How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ?
Btr001_668	Um , ; you know . ; In the prev ; You 've also gone through
Bsr001_771	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Sorry I interrupt you .
Bmr010_1418	No , Javier di doesn't worked with , uh , a Markov ; Yeah , I didn't think so . ; He on only train ; Oh , OK . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential
Bmr005_1138	And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a in a situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical . ; So for those kind of reasons , ; and also a a c a complete inversion , ; if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .
Bmr003_2040	But this was the uh just just to review , ; and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . ; And and crinkle them and ; And th " that " being a diagram .
Bmr028_552	I I I There 's no not much difference between the the one - second and the two - second one . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run less risk of missing some some speech . ; Backchannel .
Bed004_607	But , presumably that that that functionality 's there when when we ; So the immediate problem is just deciding w which ; Aspects of the X - schema to add . ; Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is is back t t to what you were what you are doing with the belief - net .
Bed005_523	it 's not going back down . ; So , this is um , what I got today is the the new um M - three - L for um , the Maps , ; Yep . ; uh , and with some examples
Bed015_2243	Liz actually said she likes four ; because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know the discussions short . ; OK . ; OK , four .
Bmr003_1429	They thought about ; Hmm . ; and also it 'll go around the c the , uh , ; I wanna say cursor
Bed012_370	So again , it 's it 's some kind of , uh ; Bayes - net . ; Yeah , sure . ; OK so , then , the question i So then my question is t to you then , would be
Bed002_406	Yep . ; Um , but the p the ; Anyway . So the thing is , i uh , d naively speaking , you 've you 've got a for this little task , a belief - net , ; which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things ,
Bmr003_1286	Mm - hmm . ; To carry on doing it ? ; What Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p ; So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions .
Btr002_2976	So , um , my my the way I do those things when I hear those , if is to I use in parentheses one " X " so it 's marked . ; OK . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_224	I 'm just throwing it out . ; But uh , it seems like we could have I mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant into the Where - Is node answer ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bed015_153	There was talk of changing the name of that . ; And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like ? ; but about changing it to " semantic n effects " , ; which I thought was a little bit too order - biased
Bdb001_1196	No . ; But once you have a file format , I can imagine writing not personally , but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool , um , that mediates between various versions , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1654	And and but then we would need to label it . ; Yeah . ; It 's a good idea . ; And that 's OK .
Bmr026_867	Right . ; I don't know . ; So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . ; And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .
Bro012_1313	uh um ; I see , yeah . Mm - hmm . ; if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_235	So I think that 's great . ; This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison , ; Yeah . ; and I didn't even spell it out here
Bmr026_728	But I do I don't I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . ; Right . ; So if we did that ; Well , except that we keep going for our full time .
Bmr001_607	There 's no , ; Oh ! ; For a couple of reasons . ; Well , but the @ @ There are two ways we could listen to it .
Bmr007_318	Yeah . ; Ah but , yeah . ; And then it would be harder ; Yeah .
Bro027_1180	Uh ; Right ? ; I mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before , ; Hmm .
Bmr008_1459	I I don't study the single channel yet ; but eh is eh is an idea . ; Well , I think it 'll be worse , ; right ,
Bro021_1177	And I fix this for all the all the sentences . ; Uh , because ; well , the VTS methods ; In fact the first thing that I do is to to obtain , uh , an expression for E
Bro017_659	Mm - hmm . ; uh Bell Labs had he this uh uh r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody , ; but but uh we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters . ; Hmm .
Bed006_379	this is something I would do . ; I would go shopping " . ; Yeah ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_512	And , ; yeah . ; And the other things , like um downsampling , upsampling , don't seem to hurt ; and the new on - line normalization , neither .
Bmr003_638	Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting . ; Right ? ; Right ? ; N right .
Bro012_233	alright ? ; Yeah . ; Um so from point five ; so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better .
Bmr010_582	Mm - hmm . ; well , she said tomorrow ; but then she said you know , ; but the , you know let 's let 's just , uh , say
Bmr016_152	We can go back to the other thing later . ; I mean we s we we 've We can do this for awhile ; OK . ; and then go back to digits for awhile ,
Bed008_1210	but ; anyway so uh it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram . ; Yeah . ; Alright ,
Bsr001_582	Oh , you 're a ; or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ?
Bro027_2028	sixth . ; That 's right , ; next three . ; And the the third one won't probably won't be a meeting ,
Bmr007_72	I noticed you C C ' ed me , but I wasn't actually a recipient . ; I didn't quite know what to make of that . ; Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting . ; OK .
Bmr007_476	OK , now . ; What ; but w we ; Wh - yeah , I I agree I agree with Adam .
Bmr022_901	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but I don't know that one . ; So what 's that mean ?
Btr001_1716	Oh yeah . ; Hmm . ; I usually take out ; um , I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they 're laughs .
Bro014_842	So we have the mel f filter bank , ; we have the FFT , ; so we just ; So it 's it 's not really an excitation ,
Bmr008_551	I It would be no problem to change it to options if um if that were desirable . ; Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other varieties of English . ; Although for different ; Well , that 's true .
Bed011_352	So , we we we wanna do more than that . ; And with this we 're getting more . ; OK . ; No question .
Bmr008_106	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; do you think that 's important ? ; I do , and the reason is because I think that um , well having been a grad student as , yeah , a as others here , at at Berkeley , that , um , I think there 's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status . ; OK .
Bsr001_761	Mmm . ; And so we are trying to push that . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_314	Well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do . ; I ; Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section ; when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway .
Bro027_1155	Yes . ; So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions . ; Right . ; Now after cleaning up it 's a different set of SNR .
Bmr019_756	Right . I mean , in general we actually ; And ; Right now the words like partial words are reject models ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_559	or ? ; the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way ; because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . ; Right .
Bro021_1195	Mm - hmm . ; This is the methods that say that we 're going obtain this . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of E minus a function that conditional to E to the T to the noise signal .
Bmr002_849	Right , ; I think , ; because she 's going to be She 's going to be the one who 's the most concerned about this kind of thing . ; OK .
Bed005_425	Well , go back , then , ; h ; cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML . ; Yep .
Bed010_599	Right . ; Hmm . ; I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o ; You know , like , " in front of the car " could you know Like ,
Bmr022_316	And there are some cases where there 's , um , very little speech before you hear a beep . ; So you hear a little bit of speech , beep , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_542	but it 's embedded numbers . ; Well I don't know . ; I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT . ; Well I think the question is what the research is ,
Bro005_384	Well Stephane was saying that they weren't hand - labeled , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's ; Yeah .
Bmr001_120	Let 's see , so we now we now have a few mikes that work . ; How long did it take you to set this up ? ; Oh ! ; It didn't doesn't take Well , I mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well , but it doesn't it doesn't take long to set up .
Bmr011_359	And so , uh , he 's he and possibly a student , there w ; there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , ; uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical . ; So he might be around .
Bmr018_313	So it will miss stuff like that which ; Well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do . ; I ; Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section
Buw001_880	Just like the ; I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting . ; Um , ; I agree .
Bro017_845	Saying . ; but ; uh , no , no I don't think that it would be the same . ; I mean , no , the If you set it to a mean , that would
Bmr027_359	That will absolutely happen . ; Right . ; Because people don't read their email , ; or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that ,
Bmr011_827	I need to acquaint myself more with it . ; But , um , there there is a way of viewing ; Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each each of them . ; And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation .
Bmr031_265	um m m m m ; Yeah . As long as you 're aware that you 're doing that , that 's I don't see that as a problem . ; You can separate it out and see how if they 're ; And then s s similarly with subject matter .
Bmr026_556	An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . ; And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system , rather than on new disk .
Bns001_1341	Well , I 'm not sure . ; I I th I think I agree with him . ; But uh right now we 're looking at b a th You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing . ; Yeah .
Bns001_877	and and and maybe some support ; and and whatever kind of thing . ; And we focus really on the networking stuff ; and going in more detail in this area .
Bdb001_1079	which you had printed out , the channelized input . ; Cuz he has all of the channels , ; you know , with the channels in the tag and stuff like that . ; Yeah , I 've seen it .
Bmr012_989	Oh it is one board . ; E eight each . ; So it it takes two fibers in to the one board . ; And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards ,
Bed002_1	 ;  ; I guess . ; OK , we 're on .
Bro027_1355	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; So the so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four ,
Bmr010_141	They they can use it ; or ? ; Uh , they they think it 's a terrific improvement . ; And , um , it real it just makes a a world of difference .
Bmr027_872	I don't see there 's a problem . ; Right . ; It 's very nice . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_125	Sorry . I got the wavefile , ; but I couldn't get the words yet . ; But the the wavefile part looks looks good . ; OK .
Bmr016_2109	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I 'd so " I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five " . ; And and actually , you know the language
Bed017_437	and then I can compute how many documents match , ; and use this as a metric in the search . ; Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results , ; and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach .
Bed011_897	Yeah , but we don't have to do it now . ; Yep . ; That was the wrong shortcut anyhow . ; And we think that 's it , interestingly enough , that um , you know , th
Bmr028_1670	No . ; Or ? ; Mm - hmm . ; What does it put out ?
Bro003_2013	No . ; So , ; um , ; I mean , if your net is gonna be outputting , uh , a vector of basically of
Bmr008_74	Categories . ; Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other . ; So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels . ; and may need some help to translate what that means .
Bro021_561	I 'm gonna be working on , um , implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far - mike system ; for the SmartKom system , I mean . ; And , um , ; one of the experiments we 're gonna do is , um , we 're gonna , um , train the a Broadcast News net ,
Bed003_1252	um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else ; and that you are in a in a in a route ; um , sort of proceeding past these things , ; so this would be just something that where you want to pass it .
Bmr018_1032	but ; I mean , we might be able , at the very worst , we can get transcribers to correct the cases where ; I mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor . ; Right ?
Bed002_533	And the parser would output ; Well , that 's a a question mark . ; sh ; A lot of parsers , um ,
Bmr022_509	So , that 's why I was curious . ; Yeah , you 're right . ; It had to have been more than that . ; I mean , it was a forty - five minute meeting ,
Bro003_881	So - s so it 's not really from the US either . ; Is that ? OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_669	you know it 's an action . ; Well , it also has this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor ; or somebody 's gonna do the walking . ; Or if you talk about an adjective " red " , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red .
Bed006_468	But not not any time part . ; OK , so that 's good . ; That 's better than running into problems . ; OK .
Bro019_1272	uh , ; you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , ; and let the ; But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time ,
Bro003_865	Yeah , we 're really covered there ; now . OK . ; And the French from France . ; OK .
Bmr008_1461	Well , I think it 'll be worse , ; right , ; I think the mixed ; to to begin to work with the eh with the one single channel . Now .
Bsr001_1358	Um . ; So the kinds of , you know the kinds of speech is the speech is gonna be slightly different . ; People are gonna be in an unnatural task . ; We 're we 're t gonna be trying to figure out how they 're gonna
Bro018_870	I was looking I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created . ; And um his uh the way that the S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly , ; uh and does all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly . ; Right .
Bro012_1121	Also is Stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about uh voiced - unvoiced ; to work uh here in voiced - unvoiced detection . ; Yeah . ; And we are looking in the uh signal .
Bed015_1597	Use the same Yep . ; So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . ; I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1519	OK . ; Uh , then the acronyms ; y and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of , ; and I haven't been able to listen to to to clarify ,
Bro028_1109	And this is k sorta like ; Or the or features . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bro005_1056	Yeah . It 's a little strange ; or ? ; but on the other hand they did it before . ; Mmm ?
Bmr031_1447	Yeah . ; And we had different levels . ; Now we have things like " amuse " . ; Like , " oh , you finally got it " .
Bmr026_833	You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing . ; So . ; Um Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely . ; Cool .
Bmr022_978	If we could build an adaptor that went from ; cuz I think mine looks like this too . ; If we had this style plug that went to that , then we 'd just have adaptors ; Right .
Bro011_345	Yeah . ; There 's those that ; uh ; yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on uh what " good features " are
Bmr006_134	so ; Yeah , yeah . ; Right . ; OK .
Btr002_910	Because you can just click y ; Yeah . ; I just drag the line . ; See , I never I never do that for some reason .
Bmr024_1057	Mmm . ; On an XH uh , X X whatever partition . ; Yeah . ; That 's not a bad idea .
Bmr026_668	Jane , I think . ; Well I know Well , Jane an ; Yep . ; Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this
Bed003_696	Oh , ; so , I thought that was directly given by the context switch . ; That 's a different thing . ; What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , " I want to go uh , see the uh the the castle and uh , et cetera . "
Bro004_545	So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test ; No these are the s s s same noises , ; and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect ; yeah .
Bro007_327	And with the all the output of the combo . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bns002_716	Yeah , yeah . ; but this is this is a way that it is it is being explored by other researchers , ; but not not uh , by me . ; But uh , there is , uh one , at least one person who is who is doing what they call " topology control " ,
Bmr013_906	So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel ; because maybe it was someone else 's breath , ; or Uh , ; so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing .
Btr001_2595	Yeah , I did that once too . ; Yeah . ; and , yeah , you must have too . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro021_1176	Yeah . ; And I fix this for all the all the sentences . ; Uh , because ; well , the VTS methods
Bro016_703	um , in terms of gender ; the data ? ; Do you know ? ; Mmm .
Btr002_1523	Hmm . ; Oh . That 's interesting . ; I haven't paid attention to the numbers . ; I sort of like visually , i
Bmr026_986	Mm - hmm . ; cuz they were self consistent ; but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . ; Uh . But that was a that was a good good good way to start .
Btr002_948	Yeah . ; Yep . Yep , yep , yep . ; and then end up collapsing the timebins . ; And and then collapse it .
Bro028_598	and I they they , um , released like a smaller data set that you can use that only takes like sixteen hours to train and stuff . ; So I can I can run it on that just to make sure that the the thing works and everything . ; Oh ! Good . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1240	I like that . ; Yeah you have to do it on all channels because it 's , uh audible . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I like that .
Bro018_1205	I mean , ; so that 's the question . ; Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that that isn't isn't sort of industry industry standard great , ; Uh - huh .
Bed014_1330	Right . ; Yeah , yeah . No , that 's fine . ; It was a little strange . ; I just wanted t to
Bmr001_95	I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things . ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Right ?
Bed005_1232	So ; And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh ; There are a couple other ones . ; There are ways of breaking this up into s to to subnets and stuff like that .
Bmr022_500	Right , but my point was , you know , if It 's a big difference to me if there 's a thousand or there 's a hundred . ; If there 's a thousand , then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand . ; Which means , you know , even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take You know , nearly all the time , ; there would be no
Buw001_2250	and that actually may be a goal . ; So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , ; uh , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . ; So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .
Bns001_832	So , the the name is " Network Services and Applications " , ; s so what could be an en example of a network application if you look at the OZ stick ? ; Yeah , we have , I think , some . ; Yeah .
Bro005_210	Th - Yes . ; Training of the net , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1440	Yeah . ; I mean ; I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1139	Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , ; Yeah . ; Exactly . That 's why we discussed that . ; is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " ,
Bro028_1052	so I know it 's pretty old , ; uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis ; in which you which ; I think it 's used in social sciences a lot .
Bmr024_1163	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Um , another , thing on the agenda said SRI recognition experiments ? ; What 's that ?
Bro018_675	and and um I don't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to to try this ; and you know , it was the first time they tried it , ; so so the you know , the numbers were not incredibly good ; Hmm .
Bro014_378	Yeah . ; Right . ; you know , ; and and and say here 's how much you , uh you improve the , uh the the relatively clean case
Bro027_1856	um ; But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway . ; And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_140	I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or and they put in extraneous beeps . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely .
Bmr002_1320	Mm - hmm . ; OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all . ; It 's not it doesn't take any thinking . ; Yeah .
Bns001_381	and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop . ; Is that the problem ? ; Yeah , that 's not the problem . ; Right .
Bdb001_568	Yeah . ; I I definitely agree ; And then ; and I wanted to find actually a f a nicer format or a maybe a more compact format than what we used before .
Bmr010_309	OK . OK . Alright . ; The other thing , uh , to keep in mind , ; uh I mean , ; we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling
Bed002_506	Well , they keep it . ; We have to request it . ; Right . ; Nuh ?
Bsr001_1150	Um , I 'll tell you later . ; Yeah . ; Sorry , listeners . ; And to our listening audience .
Bmr016_1429	That 's " eh " versus " ah " ? ; Eh . ; Eh ? ; " Eh , " yeah right ,
Bed010_578	Um , as a matter of fact ; No , it 's not . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_336	and the other reviewer says , " this is way too specific " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_925	OK . ; But I mean . I don't know . ; Whatever . ; No , that 's fine .
Bro012_274	whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone ; so it 's it 's clean speech basically ; so you don't have this problem of local minima probably ; and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone
Btr002_1873	You know , and then doing the sounds , ; Aw ! ; and then , " This sound must be this sound ! ; Oh .
Bro027_1802	Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2141	So . ; That 's really cruel . ; OK , ; s
Bmr027_1343	I think this actually didn't just come from her , ; but this is what , uh , DARPA had asked for . ; Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . ; But of course the fiscal year starts in October ,
Bro027_561	Yeah . ; Delta at input to net ? ; And there i ; Yeah .
Bro010_730	the word " stationary " is has a very precise statistical meaning . ; But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , uh , compared with our our processing techniques . ; So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_805	So you 're we 're you said it was almost half , ; so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours ; and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are transcribed ? ; Yeah . The the pie chart shows actually m meetings that are ,
Bmr001_571	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; we 're talking about a half hour of of speech ; Yep .
Btr001_267	Oh . ; If you 're talking about who I think you 're talking about ; I think ; are you talking about
Bmr030_564	Not even hook it u ; Well , I guess we need to hook it to the network ; We ; so we can get the files to it ,
Bed014_725	That that 's the argument in the other direction . ; at at ; Yeah , and this is ; Even though uh the lexical construction itself out out of context , uh , won't do it .
Bns003_740	we we ; I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_241	Good . ; So we want s " designates " to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects ; but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . ; So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , " are you of type is this part of type whatever " , um , the " designates " tells you which sort of part is the meaning part .
Bmr012_1140	and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to ; A hand - held , ; yeah . ; that 's a good idea
Bmr003_1112	and it will take maybe five or six times real time . ; And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour ; and it takes about ten times real time . ; I see .
Bmr014_690	You find it easier to go through a large ; I mean how do you read books ? ; Well I certainly read books by hand . ; But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web .
Bmr022_1390	nice to have a notation for that , ; Gotta go . ; but . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_634	So , yeah . ; I guess that sort of makes sense . ; The reason I say the demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh observed everything in favor of taking a tour , ; and it came up as " Tango " ,
Bro022_1166	but this it 's work . ; And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result ; Yeah . ; I I would like to know if
Bsr001_735	Yep . ; OK , ; uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary to do it ; and , you know , some of it may go into something , depending on , you know , your scalable power .
Bro012_666	And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , ; so . ; Oh great . ; OK .
Bed009_836	Then there is of course more ways of parsing things . ; Of course . ; But But uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing . ; And uh I 'm not a big believer in this um statistical you know , cleaning up
Bro022_381	So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate ; and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . ; Uh , but is it exactly the same system ? ; Uh .
Bro004_244	yeah . ; OK . ; And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ? ; If we exclude English , um there is not much difference with the data
Bmr008_474	I mean , th there 's room on the form to put al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be . ; I I I 'm sorry , so you 're saying ; but ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_783	No . ; By making it narrower , ; Right ? ; I mean there 's you 're you 're allowing for less variance .
Bed014_1371	So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that . ; Yeah , we could talk tomorrow . ; I was just gonna say , though , that , for instance , there was you know , out of a meeting with Johno came the suggestion that " oh , could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection ? " ; which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about .
Bed016_391	so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy , ; one of Nancy 's st ; OK , I can give you a more recent if you want ; well , that might have enough .
Bmr007_967	Really ? ; One once It 's a I used to work , like , on voiced on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this kind of thing . ; Yeah . ; Um If you have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily .
Bdb001_1152	um , ; eh , gr this is sort of r regarding uh , uh it 's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion , ; but , when it comes to annotations , um , you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same , say , word sequence . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1663	No problem , ; I think you 've got one on hand , ; huh ? ; yeah .
Bro012_1243	um ; But the thing is that you can't ; given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information ; the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced ,
Bed006_800	OK . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; The S Action - schemas basically have extra
Bns001_242	This afternoon you mean ? ; Yeah . ; No , this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks ; OK
Bed005_981	It 's probably just as easy . ; I ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1773	It 's No , like , ; yeah , it 's like . ; It 's like ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2481	In one ear . ; but I don't remember the combinations . ; The order , ; yeah .
Bro016_571	Do we know anything about the speakers for each of the , uh , training utterances ? ; What do you mean ? ; Do you have speaker information ? ; We we
Bmr012_1205	right ? ; And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ? ; I don't know . ; OK I 'll I 'll ask .
Bmr006_43	Well , great . ; Great . ; And he 's already funded part - time , ; so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,
Bed015_216	Sure . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , unless I go with " meaning "
Bed010_428	Um . This week I guess um , kind of I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . ; So yes , I might I can be around . ; And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2545	yeah . ; Huh . ; The projector is much louder than the air conditioning . ; This is the first time we 've done it with a projector .
Bro023_4	we 're going . ; Damn . ; And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_379	Yeah . ; OK . ; so ; if reservation doesn't work OK , if uh one reservation don't succeed then , uh , this transmission should have to wait .
Bns003_49	and I 'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box . ; But wh wh wh what are the box ? ; A box is a s P C . ; P Cs .
Bmr016_2159	And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done . ; In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . ; Oh great . ; So right now , um , I know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type ,
Bmr026_805	More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? ; No , uh front - end features . ; You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . ; Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and
Bdb001_1275	And someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions . ; Right . ; So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data . ; But unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it .
Bns002_486	Mm - hmm . ; So , any node , ; for example , this node is a neighbor of the receiving node , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_343	there 's a web site ; and then you could like um figure out what the cate ; experiment ? ; Right .
Bro019_1616	but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ? ; In in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . ; And , um , ; w one thing that the , um , LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well .
Bmr025_739	We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , ; have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . ; And then we did it once or twice and we sort of ; Yep , and then just sort of died out .
Bro010_667	And ; well , five hundred wa was not so bad . ; I mean ; and he worked on non - stationary noises ,
Bro012_1348	Mm - hmm . ; should have some interesting properties in noise . ; Um . I know that when have people have done um sort of the obvious thing of taking uh your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related ; or
Bed002_1232	Oh , yeah , unt until we know more . ; And what 's the relation to this with Changing the table so that the system works in English ? ; OK . ; So this is Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails .
Bmr001_513	How much space is that using up ? ; Do you have any idea ? ; It 's uh twenty C Ds , ; so that 's twelve gigabytes .
Bro017_442	Hmm . ; Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier . ; Hmm . ; And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's he already has uh four years served ,
Bro003_431	so , um , everybody 's now using three point O , ; which is the same version that , uh , OGI is using . ; Oh , good . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1288	OK . ; Yeah . ; No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1348	so . ; Actually , you you also did a different type of transcription i uh , with res respect to , um , our sister project , ; the SmartKom project , ; which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through Germany ,
Bed015_159	and " semantic bindings " , ; which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings . ; And so it was an issue whether constraints um , there were some linguists who reacted against " constraints " , saying , " oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it shouldn't be called a constraint " . ; But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ?
Bmr001_787	This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something , ; and and uh we 've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty times uh real time to do this kind of transcription ; Yeah . ; um so you know in in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this .
Bmr014_485	And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don . ; But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , ; the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_450	So , we we could have a round like where you do two at a time , ; and then the next person picks up when the first guy 's done , or something . ; So pairwise . ; Oh like a round ,
Bmr015_268	Cuz I had sent one earlier ; Actually the same thing happened to me I had sent one earlier . ; The message says , " You 'll be informed " ; and then I was never informed
Bmr029_425	Yeah . ; And then , have to ask , um , I guess , Don to , uh , cut the , um , cut the segments for the sh for the tis distant mike . ; Uh , uh that 's So we would be using the same channel for each fo for everything ? ; Yeah .
Bed009_808	And yes the it the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that um Mark Light originally w worked on in while he was in Tuebingen ; and then somebody else in Tuebingen picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen , ; yeah . ; Definitely .
Bro003_1971	and translate them into acoustic uh , uh articulatory , uh , uh , features . ; So it won't really be right . ; You won't really have these overlapping things and so forth , ; So the targets of the net are these ?
Bed015_1187	Uh . ; Yeah . ; Just means ; Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ?
Bmr006_1450	So if if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . ; But if if he 's not , that 's great too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1980	Uh - huh . ; Right . ; you don't know that they 're not participating in the same conversation at all . ; Yeah .
Bns003_87	I know in the meantime it 's running , ; Uh ! ; and I will definitely set up the next one . ; So Wilbert will set up the second computer .
Bed016_789	Um , ; I never really knew what was going on , ; I mean I I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that " I 'm out of film " means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , ; It 's weird .
Bsr001_2253	Well I think that ; Mm - hmm . ; without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time . ; And if and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator , then you raise your hand , the moderator would say , you first ,
Bed009_918	s so the lexicon might be derived by Morphix ; What ? ; but What what 's happening on - line is just um um a a retrieval from the lexicon which would give all the stemming information ; Right .
Buw001_2153	It 's things occur without any ; You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , ; but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . ; OK .
Btr001_961	Yeah , ; and some people just say , " Kay . " ; Um ; Yeah .
Bed004_543	that 's another sort of thing " OK , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this " . ; Add extra properties , ; a deterministic rule for every property ; you have an action , " pppt ! "
Bmr001_406	And then ; Well no I mean it 's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes . ; That 's forty minutes ; Right .
Bmr016_1393	We 're gonna have a big problem when we talk about that . ; Cha - ching . ; Ah . ; We 're gonna never recognize this meeting .
Bmr021_769	we 've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side . ; So um since both SRI and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C - zero that 's presumably , you know , someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better . ; Um , so that 's another difference , ; and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results .
Bro010_52	Oh , OK . ; But ; So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , uh , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1349	So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying , ; e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? ; You know , like " Naomi wants wants su a certain situation ; and that situation itself is a state of affairs " .
Bed002_581	and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should ; You know . ; So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , ; i like business or travel ,
Bmr010_784	Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know why that is .
Bmr025_158	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what does the user see as the result of the query ?
Bmr022_997	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; so we have , you know , some kind of little something , ; and , uh , we have a wireless connection , this board , that 's doing the computation for the f the , uh the recognition .
Bed002_217	Um . ; We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , I think we we will agree on that , um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , ; and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling . ; So the idea is if you want to go somewhere ,
Bro027_1339	So what 's the overall effe ; I mean , you haven't done all the experiments ; but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ? ; But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower ,
Bmr016_753	Definitely ; Uh , and Don should ; And and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files ; and and do all the naming automatically ,
Btr002_2417	Yeah . OK , I know who you 're talking about . ; But this is somebody somebody differ ; He must do this in a lot of meetings ; because I think you know , I 've run across it several times .
Buw001_1766	uh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with . ; OK , excellent .
Bmr018_1446	Oh . ; Anyway , I I it 's in the program , ; I should have read it to remind myself , ; but that 's sort of useful
Bmr011_836	Yeah . ; Oh . Oh . ; I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . ; And so it 's very , very similar .
Bmr005_682	No , no . I I have to go to ; Yeah . ; because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level . ; I want eh I wanted to eh compare the the transcription .
Bmr026_13	That 's our system . ; Ugh ! ; and that it 's gone out to the transcribers ; and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .
Bmr001_781	So that I mean , that 's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; And Yeah .
Bro003_853	I mean , I couldn't tell if you were joking or ; i Is it is it Mexican Spanish , ; or is it ; No no no no .
Bmr006_179	Right . ; And if people want to approach ; Um , ; i so I know e e You know this
Bmr011_1219	wouldn't it ? ; I mean , I would think that that , uh , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . ; Which one . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_133	Um . ; Are you implying that it 's currently disorganized ? ; In my mind . ; Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the SRI recognizer et cetera ,
Btr001_2146	M Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; A couple people in particular do that , ; Yeah ,
Bed017_666	No . Wh - I had something in my calendar . ; Oh , OK . Right . ; Um , ; Wait a second .
Bro019_218	Right . ; And then it 'll make sure that it never goes above that . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr018_1457	Well , I like the idea that Adam had of of , um , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have ; because it would be easy to to to do that ; just , you know , ; Right .
Bns001_1221	Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this . ; That you can use it with every application ; and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network , that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom , it must be fit end to end . ; And if you assume something , like we discussed it , very hard with with Multicast , that you assume that Multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end , this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet .
Bro014_1247	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , that that has the effect of both , ; Yeah .
Bns001_1214	why it changed so . ; If you 're focussing on the argument chain as follows . I have an application . ; This application has certain kind of requirements . ; These requirements are , maybe , Multicast and and and quality of service and mobility
Bns001_1007	then it will be HTP real HTP or something . ; So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection . ; It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML , ; but that 's all what 's uh
Bed009_1008	So there are these decisions . ; And then one half of this we talked about at little bit is how if you had the right information , ; if you knew something about what was said ; and about th the something about was the agent a tourist or a native or a business person
Bmr005_380	Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , ; be ; No no , but I think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? ; Oh .
Bmr011_1681	So we can like post a ; Yeah , now that is not actually what we ; Th - that 's not what we want . ; No , not to that extent
Bmr020_378	That 's great . ; Yeah . ; even though there is this back ; Yeah , I guess that doesn't surprise me ,
Bmr008_1577	Uh - huh . ; right ? ; So it 's looking for some periodic behavior , ; and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that .
Bmr011_1153	The first meeting had I think just four people , ; Four speakers , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah .
Bro011_514	But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning ; and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the ; So where did he get his uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? ; From uh canonical mappings um at first
Bmr018_1146	so that one is really very very accurate . ; Oh . ; I men I mentioned the link . ; Oh ,
Bro007_502	if ; three PM . ; Three PM . ; Alright , that 's six in the morning here .
Bed016_495	You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , ; you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . ; Like I believe you had " Jackendorf " . ; Um .
Bed008_1260	All of their outputs combined to make a decision . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_887	That 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? ; Yeah . ; Why twenty - eight ? ; I don't know .
Bns003_858	OK , ; it 's it 's not really the subject ; It it ; but in a broader sense it could be seen in that sense .
Bmr003_2262	But , you always ; Uh , ; well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the the , uh , powering system . ; And I I was gonna do this very clever phantom power
Bro013_780	Oh . OK . ; That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups . ; OK . ; So so it 's
Bmr014_620	Hmm . ; Ah . ; how do you call it ? ; I 'm not sure .
Bro012_908	You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; So I think ,
Bro024_1738	s So to summarize the performance of these , SpeechDat - Car results is similar than than yours so to say . ; Yeah , ; Yeah . ; so the fifty - eight is like the be some fifty - six point
Bro003_760	Uh , no , Italian no . ; Digits ? ; Italian no . ; Oh .
Bro003_838	Spanish ; No . Albayz ; Spanish something . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1100	OK . Well , le let 's see now , ; there 's another another methodo ; what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things . ; Huh .
Buw001_2054	Yeah . ; Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? ; What ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_432	I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case , um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance . ; Right ? ; And and y you wouldn't like that to be the case . ; You wouldn't like that as soon as you step outside
Bro016_650	Fairly quickly you can do male female f male female stuff . ; Yeah . ; But as far as , ; I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back .
Bed009_897	at least for German you have all all of the uh the stemming information . ; Yeah , we can , ; oh yeah . ; We have knowledge bases from from Verbmobil system we can use
Bed002_986	Mm - hmm . ; you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .
Bmr005_1340	Yeah , ; So it 's a great idea , ; I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck . ; and if it were true than I would just do that ,
Bro004_1403	For for Aurora ? ; For HTK ? ; For ; Yeah . For the Aurora ?
Bmr008_1297	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it , ; he should be getting it today .
Bro019_1047	Yeah . ; Um , ; well we 've ; Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too .
Bed004_444	where the things were I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other ; Yeah . ; So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally ; Yeah .
Bro023_1495	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro003_893	Like ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed006_882	whatever , ; you know , that which are ; So very specific role names are " viewed thing " , " entered thing " ; think think of enter , view and approach as frames
Bmr016_247	so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , ; which is totally American speakers , ; and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database . ; Right .
Buw001_1458	They 'd be s they 'd be separate . ; They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries . ; OK . ; Yeah , that 's like
Bro012_679	Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , ; cuz ; uh the uh um ; I mean , actually the the
Bmr026_1088	I think it 's a bug . ; So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ? ; Yep . ; And then
Bed010_869	d Well , yeah , ; where it actually is is covers the whole range of things . ; And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , ; and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms .
Bed016_815	Yeah . So th ; You got there . ; That part is fine . ; You got to out of it .
Bmr016_1961	OK , that 's what I was asking . ; Right . ; Only it 's spelled out in words . ; So i this is also spelled out in in words .
Bns002_22	This is not related to hearing , ; it 's only for fixing it . ; It 's not a earphone . ; Ah , it 's not a hear
Bmr015_203	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , if there 's space , though , between them .
Bed008_1489	isn't it ? ; Oh function properties , ; is that it ? ; Hmm , I guess not .
Bmr007_211	Well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps . ; Yep . ; Yes , yes ! ; Oh , OK interesting .
Bmr026_445	But I 'm using XH H , too . ; Yeah , it 's probably Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive , ; So . ; Oh OK .
Btr002_1476	I think ; Yeah . ; And then there 's like this little resolution changer . ; Yeah .
Bro008_148	And so , um , ; uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . ; But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using ; because these , uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects .
Bmr023_1122	I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem ; Mm - hmm . ; thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right . ; Yeah . It 's hard with features ,
Bro019_1529	So you just ; Yeah . ; instead of the log you took the root square , I mean cubic root or something . ; What di w I didn't get that .
Bro008_451	Um , and Um , ; so , I think that , you know , this is a , uh this is a neat data set . ; Um , and then , uh , as we mentioned before , we also have the the new , uh , digit set coming up from recordings in this room . ; So , there 's a lot of things to work with .
Bdb001_742	I I mean , I can't do it , ; but I can ; um , ; y y you gotta you gotta do this you you 're gonna want to do this very quickly
Bed014_324	they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . ; Mmm . ; So there 's a term " dynamic belief - net " , doesn't mean that . ; It means time slices .
Bro011_678	right ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; that that maybe , you know , uh you really want three or nine or ; Well one thing I mean , if I if if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians .
Bro025_488	So . Yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , uh , this is doing right now . ; I see . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2706	but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those those locations , ; Right . ; and you know , maybe there 'd be ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_888	OK . So we have five that are potentially releasable then . ; So the c the cross - hatching there is , um is ; it 's been through the double - check . ; Right ?
Bmr011_1081	Then a chunk , then a transcription . ; That 's great , ; cuz the recognizer can ; Uh , it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also .
Bmr015_1000	uh , the fact that there was some ; I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you , ; and you know about , ; Yeah .
Bmr031_986	Definitely Wed - Definitely Wednesday I 'm not here , ; so I don't record anything . ; No one early next week . ; Yeah . Let me check with Robert again ,
Btr002_3171	Right . ; which is a which is a a filler item . ; Right . ; Does have a meaning .
Bmr026_587	Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? ; Yep . ; Oh , oh oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_685	I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . ; And then they 'd hand it back to you . ; But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . ; These are big ,
Bmr010_702	I talked to some IBM guys , uh , last January , I think , I was there . ; And ; so people who were working on the on their ViaVoice dictation product . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1010	and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel . ; Um , so I think I think that 's the real power of it . ; I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements . ; Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better .
Bmr003_2003	No . ; No . ; therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing " . ; But I think the point is to try and be coherent and make it a nice presentation .
Bmr020_1814	the default . ; Yeah , ; s a ; OK .
Bmr020_1060	cuz of the memory . ; Well , yeah . ; That 's fine . ; So , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context ,
Btr002_3419	Right . ; Do it separately , then . OK . ; Sure did . ; Yes .
Bro005_419	Which number ? ; cuz this is , uh with multi - English , uh , training . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box ,
Bro003_1275	And uh , ; on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort " that 's ; Yeah . ; I think it 's a great thing to go to .
Bro010_1230	like , uh , uh , training different network on different reverberation conditions ; and then trying to find the best one , ; but . Well . ; Yeah .
Bro024_589	Yeah . ; Oh ; or this is ? ; Oh . Yeah .
Bns003_171	Um ; and the alumni page , in principle , we have to , ; you know , but it 's primarily my job , I believe , uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis ; alumnis ,
Bmr028_1416	OK . ; Yeah . ; Because normally you wouldn't have that data available . ; OK . OK .
Btr002_1208	OK . ; That 's good . ; Oh , let me see . ; So , um , I I wanted to , um , m maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this ,
Bed011_478	OK , sorry . ; But um I I think this approach will very well work , ; but the person was able to look at it and say " OK , This is what I would actually do . " ; Yeah .
Bmr002_995	So it 's very interest I mean , it 's interesting that one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman from the LDC ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Which means that I don't know what " coordinator " means in in terms of that .
Bro004_1212	Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad ; and nobody wants has has approached improving them . ; So it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . ; So this might just be a temporary thing .
Bmr012_568	and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . ; Um so that 'll be something that ; actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . ; Because it 's just gonna give us time marks
Bmr025_647	Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it ; and that 's a multi - step procedure . ; And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1187	you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . ; OK . Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry ? ; It would make sense . ; OK .
Bmr006_380	I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . ; Here . ; I mean , that 's that 's ; OK , so
Bmr008_254	If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ? ; You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something . ; Yep . ; It could be st It could be That 's true .
Bed002_919	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Sh - Is sh ; She started taking the class last year
Bed006_546	We 're done . ; we 're done ! " ; So that was like one of the first l You know , the first task was getting it working for English . ; So that 's basically over now .
Bed017_553	Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um , yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , ; Mmm . ; cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly ,
Bmr028_684	Yeah . He ; Well , no . I think he wanted u us to tell him when . ; How about during the picnic ? ; Ah .
Bmr009_608	Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I think a a another parameter we c we we can consider is eh the duration .
Bro010_1292	uh , even if there are no digits . ; OK , ; yeah , ; I didn't notice this .
Buw001_149	uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan , ; and ; where am I ? ; I 'm on channel three .
Bed014_486	So you might be yeah , y And asking for directions . ; Um ; Should we have a a a ; or or whether the construction semantically , uh , is clearly only asking for location
Bed008_1281	So we would like to do this kind of combination . ; Alright , so ; um ; Is that uh
Bro016_244	Right . ; But there 's uh , your your your substitutions tend to go up as well . ; So , uh , I I I think that , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_172	Really . ; Yeah . ; Is that more or less than you thought ? ; It depends on how good the mike is .
Buw001_88	OK . ; Alright . ; So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , ; and , um , uh , you you put up there data format ,
Bro010_109	Well , I don't know , ; perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt ; because the phase is almost linear ; but .
Bro005_1266	well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , ; but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now ; to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_613	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro010_161	That 's a little bit of a problem . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; But , well , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright .
Bro019_1072	that we have uh , for the uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually . ; It 's the far field mike . ; And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things . ; And that 's what most o
Bmr009_602	like probably , if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , he we 're not paying him the full RA - ship for all the time . ; So . um If we got it to where we wanted we needed someone to do that
Bmr005_596	i i it 's a reference for me . ; But eh the transcription eh for example , I I don't I I 'm not interested in the in the in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , ; in the in the meeting , ; um eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone .
Bmr022_703	and I was impressed by the accuracy , ; it looks really good . ; Yeah , it does look good . ; I mean , I found several errors ,
Bmr002_389	But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it . ; The other thing is is that we might be ; Oh . ; Oh , I see .
Bsr001_2450	I don't ; M that sorta thing . ; Uh ; That 's right ,
Bed004_501	Mm - hmm . ; And this these uh this changed now only um , um ; It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once . ; Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways .
Bns002_1248	So , the point is that eh Bluetooth is mainly a technology for cutting these kind of cables . ; You know , sh oh short short distance cables , ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bro017_423	Yeah . ; I know . ; I know , I know , ; you know , huh .
Bed015_1618	There 's languages where , um , ; if you have a verb of saying then , ; ehhh , ; where
Bro026_413	Cuz that happens before the mel conversion , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion .
Bmr011_1825	that gets transcribed in it , or both . ; And it 's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that . ; So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . ; Uh , the IBM one is more it 's an open question right now .
Bed011_566	OK . ; Yeah , probably between stops back at the hotel . ; OK . ; Got it .
Bed006_306	And then we 're going to have another we 're gonna have w another trial run ; IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two ; and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay ; for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI .
Btr002_2682	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Right .
Bed003_1602	Yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . ; confused . ; In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities , and see appropriate action . ; Yeah .
Bed013_205	cuz I went and looked at it ; cuz I was thinking , that could not be right , ; and it would it was on the order of twenty output nodes and something like twenty ; And like thirty input nodes
Bmr009_314	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . ; e Actually , I was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,
Btr001_907	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Mmm , oh right . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr002_647	Can I be excused , ; and I 'll go down and get my stuff ? ; because um I I do think ; You don't
Bmr019_145	uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , the , uh the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know , all the participants in Aurora , was so much worse than the than the S R ; Everybody . ; And the interesting thing is that even though , yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , it 's just not as good as having a a l very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big HMM . ; Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this .
Bmr009_1208	Well , Boston 's @ @ , too . ; Or ; " Characterize your accent if you can . " ; and and so I would say , " I don't know " .
Bro011_431	and it 's e but it ; I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , ; whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know , linguistics students , ; this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before
Bmr007_942	And if , if you do that , eh eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh of distance in a first step , and then you , eh you get the , eh the hypothesis to the this change acoustic , eh to po process ; Right . ; Because , eh eh , probably you you can find the the eh a small gap of silence between speaker with eh eh a ga mmm , small duration Less than , eh two hundred milliseconds for example ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_741	We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances . ; uh the the boundary ; We cut it s s ; We don't we don't know , actually .
Bed005_731	Right . ; OK . ; And a l and a lot and and anaphora , and pronouns , ; Nuh .
Bro018_364	I don't know . ; Yeah , I ; um Right . ; Sixteen over two .
Bmr014_152	So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , ; possibility of six wireless receivers , ; and apparently you can chain those together . ; And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
Bmr027_427	you know . ; Oh , excellent . ; But the thing is that , you know , I I I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this . ; Yes .
Bmr018_991	That was everybody 's hope . ; But if we can't , then maybe we just have to ; And maybe we can for the non - lapel , but ; is it worth
Bmr014_47	And I don't know what the e electronics is but . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , I think it 's
Bed011_788	Yeah , OK . ; Hmm ? ; You could say " some " in there . ; I must say that thi this one looks a bit strange to me .
Bro017_620	General pow power . ; Like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1290	OK . ; I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . ; Right . ; But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them .
Btr002_1594	The little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people 's voices ; Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool . ; and ; Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface .
Bmr015_351	It 's just from his message it sounded like that . ; Just just th ; Yeah . Yeah . ; I said something , yeah .
Bed006_132	and he was uh he he agreed completely that some something confusing happened . ; Um his idea was to get sort of the l the lists of mayors of the department , ; the students . ; It it 's exactly how you interpreted it ,
Bmr026_137	Yep , that 's another agenda item . ; OK . ; I 'll wait . ; So , uh
Bsr001_1707	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed015_232	OK , um , ; so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . ; And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types . ; Oh , one thing I should mention is about " designates " .
Bed006_109	Yes . ; OK . ; and um ; Not witch - like .
Bmr014_775	agree with what Adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . ; I see . ; OK , well , if that 's what it said . ; And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l
Bns001_1004	It 's stored in a WAP cookie , ; much like HTP ; in a cookie and from the WAP gateway ; then it will be HTP real HTP or something .
Bed012_847	Eva ? ; Yeah . ; Not Eva ? ; What if I were What if I were to call you Eva ?
Bro026_738	No , it 's just a straightforward HMM . ; Oh , OK . ; You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr025_982	Yeah . ; Sounds breathy to me . ; OK . ; Breath and lau
Bmr008_790	like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category . ; but it 's not ; It can't be relied on only . ; Right .
Bmr008_1385	so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which makes sense , ; Which is the intuition , ; Yeah . ; un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten ,
Bmr007_1034	But , eh ; I I Sorry . ; I I have found that when when I I analyzed the the speech files from the , eh mike , eh from the eh close eh microphone , eh I found zones with a a different level of energy . ; Sorry , I have to go .
Bro003_31	And uh mostly uh First though about the logistics for it . ; Then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know , might accomplish . ; Uh ; OK .
Bmr024_767	So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ? ; Yeah . ; Alright . ; So , w we will hafta worry about format .
Bed005_367	You mean , where the where the act how the action " Goodbye " maps into something ; Yeah . ; Yeah , where are those constructors defined ? ; Oh .
Bro019_1376	Um , nothing I wanna really talk about . ; I can I can just uh , um , share a little bit ; Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about uh , what I 've been doing . ; Yeah .
Bed005_403	cause some of them ; there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , ; Right . ; like the n s " Discourse Status Confirm " .
Bsr001_1112	And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group . ; OK . ; IRAM group is paying for part of it . ; And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well .
Bmr011_939	I agree . ; there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . ; Yeah , ; that 's
Bro023_501	They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter , ; Yeah . ; but the final filter , what they do is they they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse Fourier transform . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr019_1524	It 's , uh , something in ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Twenty percent relative gain .
Bro018_982	I mean , ; um , um ; what you can do is um you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1410	If somebody tell us , " OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . " How can I do it now ? ; So mmm ; I 'm still trying to you know , to get used to the uh all the ideas ; and to see that all the things are really connecting
Bmr019_1113	Oh . ; Yes . ; Oh ! ; Oh .
Bed003_1236	or you know something , ; Opening hours or something like that . ; other cues . ; Exactly .
Bmr011_816	He expressed a lot of interest in reliability . ; It 's like he 's he 's really up on these things . ; He 's he 's very ; Um , independently he asked , " well what about reliability ? "
Bmr010_1530	that , uh , their suggestion of of ; Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models , ; uh , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did . ; And one of those things , looking at the statistical component ,
Bro011_218	But well , we are working in this also ; Yeah . ; and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't ; When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process
Bro010_170	yeah , but then there 's ; plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . ; Oh . ; So it would be around two hundred and forty
Bmr029_264	Actually , the longer the Robustness meetings take longer , ; because there 's this one speaker who talks a lot . ; And so ; the Um .
Bmr022_48	Hmm . ; So it took me several hours just to do that . ; So this is ; For one meeting .
Bmr008_48	And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form . ; so , I had a first pass of it , ; and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff ; and so I have a first pass at it .
Bmr005_130	pretty much , ; or ? ; and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . ; OK .
Bro019_856	Mm - hmm . ; So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace , ; I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_473	Hmm . ; So . Uh Yeah . ; Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed ; Do you remember ?
Btr001_2612	Yeah . ; Oh , I 've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do . ; Sometimes they don't . ; Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well .
Bro019_1300	Yeah . ; and it was very short . ; Hmm . ; But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian .
Bdb001_1005	We did it at the t tool - level . ; That that most many of them can s you can specify several P - files ; and they 'll just be done sequentially . ; OK .
Bmr012_615	as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps ; yeah . ; This is not that good . ; there 's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well
Bmr012_721	but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on ; Alright ; it 's just that we 're ; we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts
Bmr026_631	This ; Is this gotta be in the morning ? ; So that 's an ; Um
Bmr003_495	Apparently this was like phase one ; Got it through the LDC . ; and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that ; Great .
Bmr018_1118	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I 'm thinking about scripting that for my talk , you know , put put a little script in there to say " Your batteries are low " right when I 'm saying that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro011_229	and ; OK . ; maybe will be good result or bad result , ; we don't know .
Bns002_524	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this node is W won't be sending the eh eh CTS packet to the transmitter . ; OK .
Bed003_137	or something like that . ; But see the thing is , if it 's ; OK . ; Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from
Bmr018_935	Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment , ; right ? ; Because you would say You would have to determine what the surroundings were . ; You could just say it 's a noise , though , and write , you know , a post - processor will just
Btr001_491	Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . ; I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German . ; Yeah . ; German .
Bmr012_627	Right . ; and uh see if it 's , you know ; is it a hundred twenty percent ; or maybe it 's not
Bed003_508	Yeah , similarly " closed " , I guess . ; So we can either be in a hurry or not , ; but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ? ; Well , we
Bro018_1015	You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a ; So I started going through and looking ; One of the things that I did notice was that the um log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the PLP data were much lower , much smaller , ; than for the mel cepstral stuff , and that the average amount of pruning that was happening was therefore a little bit higher for the PLP features .
Bmr009_382	" Great ! " , ; " Yeah ! " ; Yeah . ; And it doesn't take you don't take the floor .
Bmr003_1902	And we have we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around . ; I have several ; and Dan has a few , ; Yes .
Bmr002_1271	' You know , so right now we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change . ; Mm - hmm . ; Me . ; I want those things to work .
Bmr003_2245	You g ; Oh , how great . ; Cool . ; Yeah .
Bed011_958	Um If you ; Is that roughly the equivalent of of what I 've seen in English or is it ; No , not at all . ; OK .
Bmr026_732	Yep . ; Well , cuz we get into these other topics . ; Yeah . ; We feel We feel obligated to collect more data .
Bro026_783	Because there 's a mailing list for this . ; Is that OK ? ; Yeah , ; that 'd be great .
Bmr020_210	s in terms of in terms of number of words ; and also we computed something called a " spurt " , ; which is essentially a stretch of speech with uh , no pauses exceeding five hundred milliseconds . ; Um , and we computed how many overlapped i uh spurts there were and how many overlapped words there were . Um , for four different corpora ,
Bmr011_159	Mm - hmm . ; Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , ; Yeah . ; so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of
Bmr012_1242	so it 's really great ; It 's working out , thanks . ; It 's really great . ; Thanks .
Bed011_305	I mean you know , if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistic stuff . ; But I mean I 'm I 'm not really sure ; Uh , because I don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet . ; I mean w we have tested this and a y
Bro021_721	Uh , yeah . ; So I was actually that day I was thinking about d doing something about the Wiener filtering , and then Carlos matter of stuff . ; And then he showed up ; and then I told him .
Bmr027_589	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through ; I I mean , I I w I 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them .
Bro023_144	but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can . ; Right . ; And that 's actually what we 're planning to do in ; OK .
Bro016_640	Each frame comes in and it 's gotta go out the other end . ; Right . ; So , uh ; So whatever it was , it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis .
Bmr026_566	But this this is a very specific question for me . ; Basically , we can easily get one to four disks , ; I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , ; it 's no big deal .
Bed008_353	yeah . ; So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . ; OK . ; Right .
Btr002_2399	i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , " Do I have time to do this ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; and he 's calculating it in his mind . ; So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing .
Bmr012_1336	but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration . ; OK ; but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1418	Whatever you want . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Well , I would love to hear about it , ; What do you have to say ?
Bmr022_146	This is on the mixed signal , ; or are these the individual ; the ones with the beeps that they 're getting , that they made mistakes on is the mixed one ? ; They are played from the individual .
Bed005_914	which , in German , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures . ; Right . ; And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that . ; That , these guys did in a in a day .
Bed003_187	Right . ; OK . ; but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals . ; Hmm .
Bed013_762	although it could reference the NTL - ish sort of , like , um , approach . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_129	They 're flying from somewhere to somewhere , ; Yeah , ; and they 'll end up here . ; So b and also Brian Kingsbury is actually flying from , uh , the east coast on that that morning .
Bro022_272	and sometimes you won't . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And ; So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .
Bmr018_1305	they might go down to fifty - seven ; Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head . ; Mm - hmm . ; I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for ,
Bro005_1256	Yeah . ; He was doing something new ; or ? ; I I don't re I didn't remember .
Bed015_1559	So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't . ; Right . ; And again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that . ; Right .
Bmr029_376	So if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for other things to finish , then sure . ; But ; Uh , Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know , um ; Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone .
Bmr029_387	I 'm I 'm kind of questioning that . ; Well , i it ; But But ; Well , on a more basic level , also , it means that that third experiment , there are actually two differences between the other experiments ,
Bmr013_752	No . ; are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? ; Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? ; Yeah , speakers .
Buw001_340	Yeah . ; Well , what it does is provide a different ; And ; Uh , y
Bro019_573	But , ; OK . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bmr008_1237	And systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful . ; Nope . ; Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1411	Uh , so . ; Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale . ; Uh - huh . ; And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters .
Bsr001_2457	How how long are how long chunks are they , ; But what were they ? ; a ; it 's like but from one to one to nine digits .
Buw001_797	Hmm . ; And they they didn't actually align it or anything . ; They just they have it , though . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3221	Oh , yeah . ; This is an interesting category to me , ; and I don't , um , y y don't have to mark this systematically . ; But when you 're going through the meeting , and what I 'd like people to do if if you 're not uh , uh is to go through the meeting ,
Bed005_1368	OK . So , th it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world . ; Let 's assume there are only twenty object types in this world . ; And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings . ; So , in a sense , " I " used as Institutions for some s in some sense or the other .
Bmr020_1785	Acoustically , can't you tell ? ; It 's really good sound , ; so ; Oh is it ?
Bmr005_168	it 's just he was less interested in those . ; Can I ; Sorry to interrupt . ; Um , I f f f I 've @ @ d A minute uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was was not listening
Bmr016_268	OK . ; it 's it and and enunciation . ; Well , and not just that , ; I mean the uh the corpus itself .
Btr001_1600	but like I I 'm like ultra - careful . ; Mm - hmm . ; I That 's just how I am . ; But , like I
Bro003_500	Um , the the digits ; Or were they those labels automatically derived ? ; Oh yeah , ; those were those were automatically derived by by Dan using , um , embedded embedded training and alignment .
Bmr031_874	That 's after the meeting participants have gone through it . ; So I should probably send those to you , ; shouldn't I ? ; Oh .
Bro021_187	and ; Actually it was not a threshold , ; it was just adding noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1008	Um actually is this the the right way to have it ; where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision ; I think so . ; because isn't the , I mean
Bed017_88	something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today , ; and um , ; we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . ; Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy .
Bed014_454	Right , t t if to the extent that we have it , let 's write it ; OK . ; and to the extent we don't , let 's find out what we need to do . ; OK .
Bmr022_1259	Yeah . ; because the granularity of locking is at the file level . ; What - what does CVS do if they if they do overlap ? ; Uh , there 're lots of different policies for dealing with it .
Bmr030_111	Yeah . ; He did ? ; Oh - Yeah . ; Switch between applications ?
Bmr018_1308	I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for , ; but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed , ; Oh , that 's right . ; Yep .
Bmr009_796	Oh , I see . ; Oh it 's the same . ; Oh no no . ; Is is new Is OK .
Bmr020_1499	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , we have the unintelligibility convention .
Bmr009_296	Sorry . ; I ; Yeah . ; What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system .
Bed006_1235	And an Enter , a View , an Approach . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; Those are all Source - Path - Goal actions .
Bmr005_360	but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh ? n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .
Bro008_367	Uh , OK , ; so ; So s so ; I see .
Bed015_46	Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are all these things are ; it 's only slightly more stable than it was before . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more .
Bmr027_472	it might ; we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? ; Right . ; I mean , what are we gonna doing here ?
Bed016_528	Good . I see where you have it . ; So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should ,
Bro018_386	So y you 're restricted to being positive . ; And this sort of smooths it for very small energies . ; Uh , why they chose sixty - four and something else , that was probably just experimental . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_32	The big problem was , they had the wrong number of beeps in it . ; Oops . ; So it didn't align . ; And that 's exactly what I was afraid of .
Bed006_970	Mm - hmm , yeah . ; W ; Yeah e exactly . ; Um , you know this , of course , does not make sense in light of the Statue of Liberty ,
Bro028_243	But , um , we we did a first try with this , ; and it it clearly hurts . ; But , uh , how was the stream combined ? ; Uh . It was c it was just combined , um , by the acoustic model .
Bed002_369	Huh . ; Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . ; I 'll have to go back and check . ; Not important .
Bmr030_828	Mm - mmm . ; uh , the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ? ; They 're like stacked up on benches and things all over . ; It 's really crowded .
Bmr026_866	two hours something ? ; Right . ; I don't know . ; So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps .
Bed003_599	it 's not really consistent . ; They don't discuss the admission fee . ; Make that false . ; Alright .
Bmr011_609	we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels ; and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes . ; And there we 're already using fourteen . ; And we actually only have fifteen .
Bmr012_473	Yeah ; so I wou ; I should I should say that the language model is not just Switchboard ; so that 's good .
Bro005_608	So I guess the other thing is to take you know if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these , ; Yeah , and test across everything . ; and uh ; Yeah , try all these different tests .
Buw001_184	which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? ; You know , the Jimlet ; I mean , the box that contains the ; Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones .
Bmr016_1338	And so then we 'll have everything following these conventions . ; But you notice it 's really rather a small set of these kinds of things . ; Yeah . ; And I made it so that these are , um , with a couple exceptions but , things that you wouldn't find in the spell - checker
Btr002_1342	I I yeah , ; it was it was more complicated . ; That 's a down side . ; But anyway ,
Bro019_247	and you just had a , uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , ; and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , ; you can say " run command " and your HTK thing ; and it 'll find another machine ,
Bed003_1356	Yeah . Yeah . ; What sort of discourse processing is uh are the ; How much is built into SmartKom and ; It works like this .
Bro018_600	Sort of an equivalent . ; You know , it it goes back to nearest - neighbor sort of thing , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bro021_952	Oh , maybe it 's I am ; I 'm problem . ; Yeah . ; I mean , just never mind what they are .
Bro004_926	Uh , how are you how are you coming up with ; If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you ; It - It 's the single net , ; I think they have one output .
Bmr028_473	I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . And and tell her You know . Tell her your specific problem .
Bsr001_1402	That 's right . ; We 're gonna make ; And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them . ; Yeah .
Bed010_663	Right . ; You you can actually say things like , um , " it 's behind the tree from me " or something like that , I think , in in in certain circumstances in English , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr027_174	The all non - native ; That 's that 's that 's r ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bed012_264	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; The manufacturer . ; I don't see a manufacturer on it .
Bed006_1205	Um now you define uh another action , ; Forced action or forced motion . ; it 's it 's called um uh s S P G - one ; Yeah .
Bmr001_597	Right . ; Right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here . ; You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output . ; That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it .
Bed006_1431	right ? ; So like unless @ @ Are there reasons why one is better than the other I mean that come from other sources ? ; Again ; Yes because nobod no the modules don't
Bsr001_2108	Mm - hmm . ; this is great " . ; Yep . ; Oh , yeah .
Bsr001_2372	So . ; I mean , people that do prosody work , they add a few at the end ; Right . ; Oh ,
Bro024_1952	yet . ; Would you pass those down ? ; Oh ! ; Sorry .
Bmr001_49	You 're on one . ; Oh , I 'm number one . ; Absolutely . ; OK , which is a a l a lapel ,
Bmr027_1370	We have these meetings and and there 's the status reports . ; Uh . But , um . Um . ; Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something hasn't , uh ; I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon ,
Bed013_1422	Also we 're getting a a person who just got fired uh , from her job . ; Uh a person from Oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once Fey leaves in August . ; And um , she 's gonna look at it today . ; Which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue , after the thir thir after July , we can .
Bed017_108	That will be Reuter ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University ,
Bed006_369	Uh - huh . ; right ? ; That 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_2181	So , what 's what when are we gonna meet again ? ; When are you leaving ? ; Thursday , ; Fri - uh ,
Bsr001_1531	Because that 'll would be more interesting data if there is like ; Uh . ; In a given in a given meeting ? ; I mean , a budget meeting is a classic example , of where every comes in pursuit of a different goal .
Bns003_654	I ; It sounded sounded to me a little bit little bit , hard t hard hard time constraint , right ? ; That would be cool . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1225	but um we 've got a huge problem , ; because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data . ; Oh , good point . ; And um it 's just eh it 's very frightening .
Bmr010_1114	No . ; I th I I would say they 're probably they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time . ; I don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription . ; Hmm .
Bed002_1049	probably that 's not worth it . ; I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it , ; but I don't know . ; So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package .
Bmr019_732	And Chuck 's on the lapel here , ; and he also says " mixed " ; but it 's at the last one , ; and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's " mixed " ,
Btr002_99	" Ish decay . " ; Yeah , what 's an " ish " ? ; Well they they they were suspicious that wasn't right , ; but that was the closest they could come .
Bmr031_586	A lot . ; It 's still , yeah , two or three D V ; but ; Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also .
Bro027_1543	Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_851	No . ; Whole utterances only . ; Whole utterances . ; And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh
Bmr016_1694	Oh that 's cute . ; There 's no tilde in front of it , ; so . ; That 's funny .
Bro023_56	Yeah . ; So , um , I guess we got lots to catch up on . ; And we haven't met for a couple of weeks . ; We didn't meet last week , Morgan .
Btr002_676	I don't even know if it 's relevant or useful to know , ; but I 'm just curious . ; One source was , there was a problem with a connection ; where the microphone went int went into a box
Bsr001_2559	not for our meetings . ; I at least very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer . ; No ? ; It
Bed008_1193	and you just see the links that are relevant to that . ; And I ; does anybody remember the GUI on this ? ; Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know N - many belief - nets
Bmr024_398	That was it ? ; That was it . ; Just , what do we do with digits ? ; OK .
Bro004_500	let 's see ; PLP uh with on - line normalization and delta - del ; so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1293	Right . ; I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in . ; Well , we thought about it . ; Ah , OK .
Bro012_968	Mm - hmm . ; About ? ; Spectral subtraction ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_454	ar ar are ; do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ? ; Yeah , it does . ; OK .
Bmr014_1113	Ah . ; Fine . ; Good . ; OK .
Bmr028_1692	Yep . Yep . ; So , you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting , in the sense that , you know , not everyone as you just said , you won't be there . ; And then if we find any problems , have the transcribers listen and ; Yep .
Btr002_2397	OK . ; The the one that I 'm thinking of , ; i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , " Do I have time to do this ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1546	Mm - hmm . ; I don't know . ; I I don't know enough about it , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_904	Right ? ; So ; OK ? ; So . Uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff
Bmr020_1833	I have o I have one question . ; Yep . ; Do you think we should send the um that whole meeting to them and not worry about pre - processing it ? ; Yes ma '
Bed013_1419	So I 'm gonna do the wizarding ; and Thilo 's gonna do the instructing . ; Mmm . ; Also we 're getting a a person who just got fired uh , from her job .
Bro023_783	And , w um ; Yeah , but this all these things , I have to still try it on the TI - digits , ; which is like I 'm just running . ; And there seems to be not improving a a lot on the TI - digits ,
Bed005_748	so so l I can make it more concrete ? ; Well How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? ; We sort of t think that our bit in this problem is interesting , ; but , just to get from Powder - Tower to an object I ID in a database is also not really trivial .
Bro017_183	Hmm . ; We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , ; instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model . ; Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise .
Bmr009_1370	I have no clue . ; I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City . ; But I have no idea whether it does or not . ; It does seem
Btr001_249	Hmm . ; Huh . ; For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest . ; And the German speakers I found a little bit easier ,
Bed010_166	OK . ; So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us ; we just need to really understand what 's there . ; Is there anything we can make use of ?
Bmr012_871	I mean I hand - edited the whole the whole meeting ; so that can be run ; it 's just ; Once we get the the bug out .
Bmr005_878	Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? ; Uh . No . No . ; It was when I was working for the government . ; Oh , then everybody owns it .
Bro004_155	yeah , so , that is what I wanted to know . ; Yeah . ; I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess . ; Uh , yeah .
Bro019_246	Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script ; and you just had a , uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , ; and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , ; you can say " run command " and your HTK thing
Bro026_420	but I don't know . ; What about norm normalizing also ? ; Right . ; Uh .
Bns003_570	And currently you see no chance , as far as I know , uh , to stay longer here ; and either you will go back to KPN or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company , ; is that right ? ; Yes ,
Bmr002_320	I guess speaker change in any case , ; so speaker ID , ; and words . ; OK . So you 're gonna do the actual transcription yourself .
Bro012_623	So f only for the experiments on Aurora . ; Oh ! ; So it it 's good , ; yeah .
Bmr014_902	you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . " ; Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . ; I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1416	In the interest of , um , ; Yeah . ; Importance ? ; generati generating an interesting summary , um
Bro013_523	And this is ; I don't know . ; This is not the different . ; This is trying to obtain with LPC model the spectrum
Bed002_774	what what do we need , you know ; Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do ; and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_509	Yes . ; Click ; Um , ; I had suggested it before .
Bns002_1221	In the RSM band . ; S ; And the good thing is that now , especially with the new version , all you ; you ca you you are you start to see uh compatible products in the market .
Btr001_2689	When I was doing those I had to really concentrate . ; Yeah . ; It was like s " One , s seven " ; you know , it was like You really had to " let 's see , the words and the numbers "
Bmr015_577	that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up . ; We have some new microphones that I 'd like to start trying out , ; um , ; once I test them .
Bmr027_864	Quick question . ; Are , um ; Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty ; and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that .
Bro017_894	If you want to decrease the importance of a c parameter , you have to increase it 's variance . ; Yes . ; Right . ; Yes .
Bro005_1073	right ? ; Yeah , the the way we want to do ; Cuz they 're doing LDA RASTA . ; The
Bsr001_1210	But that I don't really know . ; That 's what I heard from Morgan , ; Yeah , I know . ; That that 's That 's that that that portable thing 's been mentioned .
Bed009_337	Or whatever it whatever that might be . ; So that 's under that model ; then , There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , ; Yes .
Bmr007_593	Well , there are various things , you you have the ; I mean ; Uh a vote vote in Florida . ; It 's been studied a lot .
Bro010_1084	Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So where it could help is maybe at a higher level .
Bro017_26	And and uh so , I I think that Carmen and Stephane reported on uh Amsterdam meeting , ; which was kind of interesting ; because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really , but we are competitors . ; Cuz until then it was sort of like everything was like wonderful
Bmr005_486	When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , ; um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file , to to transcribe , the the events and the words , I I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh collected by headphone . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bns001_158	cuz now we can add some more stuff there . ; Or if you have something or if somebody has some slides , o or articles , whatever he wants to be published there . ; Yeah . ; Then everybody sees the structure , how it is uh , structured really structured .
Bmr001_676	And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough , um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well . ; Yeah , I mean that 's the thing . ; It 's OK to g ; Right .
Bro019_1366	So . ; I mean , it doesn't do it very specifically , ; Mm - hmm . ; and
Bed014_238	or ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And , um , we 'll never found out why .
Bmr009_680	you know , the fact that this this gain thing was crude , ; and the gain wh if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level , just to to give a an extreme example , all you 're doing is compensating for that . ; And then you still s And then if you look at the frame with respect to that , it still should should uh change ; Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across .
Bsr001_747	OK . ; Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this you know , sc eh , higher and higher , you know , powers in these portable things .
Bmr009_454	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mind if I turned that light off ?
Bed012_948	Nah , I can't think of a way it would be infinite . ; Well , you can come up with new constructions . ; Yeah . If the if your if your brain was totally non - deterministic , then perhaps there 's a way to get , uh , infin an infinite number of constructions that you 'd have to worry about . ; But , I mean , in the practical sense , it 's impossible .
Bro022_736	Right . ; I see what you mean . ; That 's true , ; but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things
Bmr020_360	That 's right . ; OK , ; so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow , ; um , and this is the time bin that we used ,
Buw001_860	Well , I don't understand that point . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I just think that the ; The point is that we 're not saving it anyway .
Bed015_366	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic ; You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction .
Bro023_820	Tha - that it ? ; Yep . ; Yep . ; Cool .
Bmr006_1579	S i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who " you " was . ; Yeah . ; Shoot ! ; I I 'm thinking too much .
Btr002_2157	Oh sure . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr014_610	Mm - hmm . ; What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ? ; You said you 're trying some different features , or something . ; Oh I just uh Mmm , I just use um our loudness - based things
Bmr018_1135	but ; I mean , I would see Eurospeech if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions . ; These will be things that are particular things , ; aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it .
Bmr029_343	So , if they have a set that they worked with , ; and you you got ; Did you do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings , ; or was it ?
Bmr005_445	Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .
Buw001_2282	and that was one of his examples . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; When when did people laugh ?
Bro027_716	I mean , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape . ; Yeah , ; that 's what it seems like to me . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_539	You know ? ; But um , ; still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , ; with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall .
Bmr027_971	once once we ; Yes , absolutely . Yeah . ; One question about the backchannels . ; It 's gonna
Bro027_320	But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? ; You know . ; Mm - hmm . ; No .
Bmr015_340	Yeah . ; " This is way too hard " , ; " way too easy " . ; We 'll see .
Bed004_649	right , ; and then it would have values , uh , " Tour " , " Business " , or uh " Hurried " . ; Right . ; But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters .
Bro026_43	Yeah . They 're working on a different task . ; I see . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro028_165	but ; Yeah . But ; but it ; OK .
Bro023_610	What 's what 's the deal with that ? ; OK , ; so ; the Wiener filter , it 's it 's like it 's like you try to minimize
Bro014_200	Um , ; there because they start off with , uh , an initial model ; which is just this global model , ; and then they split it to the individuals .
Bns002_1266	eh or in the way people is is looking at Bluetooth ; because they can say " OK , hundred meters is is is an acceptable distance , ; let 's say , for communicating inside a building , inside a a small office . ; So , uh some people , I think , is being tempted to think that Bluetooth could provide them uh , some kind of local connectivity ,
Bmr012_554	but ; yeah . ; PZM ; and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven
Bmr006_492	Right , it can't be the internal one . ; Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . ; Although it 's ; There we go .
Bmr012_510	That makes a lot of sense , ; Yeah . ; So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones ; yeah .
Bmr006_693	Can I see that ? ; Can I get a copy ? ; Oh . ; My my idea is to work
Bmr012_837	That 's what I would assume but you never know , ; yeah . ; so ; you know .
Bro026_476	I have no idea . ; OK . ; Well , it has t I mean the th ; It would have to fit
Bmr022_665	cuz you could then really localize where the error is . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Where it is .
Bed011_695	wants to drive there , walk there , or use some other form of transportation . ; H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ? ; I mean in terms of the interesting bits . ; There 's lots of bits where you don't really
Bro018_957	Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the RASTA libs and thing like that . ; And I didn't I couldn't see any wh place where that kind of thing was done . ; But um I didn't quite understand everything that I saw , ; Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all .
Bed009_921	Right . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; so it would be a full foreign lexicon .
Bmr010_1119	you can't . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; No . You 're right . ; It 's i it would be too taxing .
Bmr028_37	so that the words appear , uh , in their own segments , rather than in long in long chunks . ; Oh . ; She said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she 's working on . ; Yeah . That 's great .
Btr002_1470	Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line . ; Mm - hmm . ; I have to do something visually . ; So , my I would say you have the transcript screen ,
Bro024_1250	Yeah . ; Uh , ppp . ; I don't know , you have questions about that , or suggestions ? ; Mmm .
Buw001_1391	so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , ; even if it 's a poor system in some ways , ; and , uh and ask the questions that they actually want to know . ; If you know , if uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that .
Bmr016_246	which were done by non - native speakers ; so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set , ; which is totally American speakers , ; and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database .
Bmr003_2099	Big screw into the table . ; Velcro . ; Uh , ; and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around
Bro023_1392	Uh ; it 's it 's added . ; It 's additive . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_553	using recurrent neural nets , they recognized um a set of phonological features ; um ; and made a mapping from the MFCC 's to these phonological features , ; so I 'm gonna do a similar thing with with support vector machines
Bro014_1229	And so you just want to find out what the filters are . ; Yeah . ; The filters roughly act like a , um a , uh a an overall resonant you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation . ; Here .
Bro012_167	Yeah , so . ; Uh . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together um the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , I mean , ; Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , ; and also the um delay issue
Bmr003_2598	Oh th the P Z ; P Z Ms cost a lot . ; But anyway you 'd save , on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system . ; So actually that might be attractive .
Bmr012_1028	and the wireless , ; this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars , ; it I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner the receiver the other end , ; that 's uh four thirty
Bed002_35	So you would just read that one . ; And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . ; And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . ; And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes .
Bed014_519	Yeah . ; But , you know , c um almost certainly " can you pass the salt " is a construction worth noting that there is this th this this this uh ; Yeah . ; Request .
Bro023_357	there are two baselines . ; OK . ; So the baseline One baseline is MFCC baseline ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1295	And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , ; and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . ; Hmm . ; It 's a nice balance .
Bro010_131	like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; so we will try also to add a nice downsampling
Bmr026_891	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; But um . ; So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits .
Bed005_538	And , um , ; I asked them whether or not we could , um ; First of all , I was little bit ; It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we 've done it before .
Bed005_1487	and try to understand it . ; Uh , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give to people ? ; p Sure . ; Yeah , I I would like a copy ,
Bro011_279	Yeah actually um he should uh ; I wonder who else is ; I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . ; Um . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings .
Bmr013_420	And i if you 're ; Well , we we 've probably have a separate , um , discussion of , uh of whether you can do that . ; That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? ; Yeah .
Bns003_92	though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a ; I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance . ; You know , I I can I can build , eh , any computer uh you n installing whatever . It 's needed , ; Yeah .
Bed005_1388	So we build a little data structure ; And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V ; And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type ; and then have the E V As for the type .
Bmr003_1967	it 's - it it 's very powerful . ; Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to . ; But ; most of the web sites I do aren't that complex .
Bsr001_369	I don't know . ; Right , ; OK . ; cuz you 've got
Bro021_1107	Right . ; OK . ; Thanks . ; Well . The idea
Bed002_630	But , only w ; Hold on a s Hold on a second . ; Muh . ; So , I know .
Bns003_645	well , it 's a little bit u out of Mark . ; I 'm ; Right now I 'm interested and I 'm looking into it ; and I 'm working started yesterday , actually working on it ,
Btr001_1644	I mean , you 've still got the maximum ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_705	Yeah , great . ; but they might not be horrible . ; Yeah . ; So but I 'll let you know when we , uh , have that .
Bns002_360	while data packets can be much mor much bigger . ; Let 's say uh one - K , five - K - s . ; OK ? ; Yeah .
Bed005_1210	Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore . ; That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR . ; So we 'll have to think of of a way t t ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1658	It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that . ; Hmm . ; Right , right . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_655	Is it the the likelihood scores below some threshold ; Yeah , is , uh it Right . ; It can't match up the ; That 's why you actually need the text .
Bns002_851	which can save a lot of data transmissions ; because eh usually when you send a a a a frame , you will want to some kind of acknowledgement back . ; So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS , well , this takes longer than just a link layer uh , extra packet . ; That , of course uh is also contemplated in this eh packet length length or included in the RTS and CTS packets ,
Bmr010_687	Yeah . ; So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , it 's gonna make
Bed014_756	OK . So if , you know if this is seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done . ; Mmm . ; Yay , it 's not me . ; It 's always me when it 's someone 's thesis .
Bmr027_591	They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through ; I I mean , I I w I 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them . ; Other methods ? ; OK .
Btr001_1455	Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either ; so it 's it 's audiotape . ; Oh wow . ; Oh , wow .
Bmr022_1207	so - and - so , it 's useful as a repository for putting that there . ; And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker , ; and didn't get mentioned in the " key " file , ; but they were only there for a second ,
Bro014_1375	I see that . ; Oh , yeah . ; The frame . ; Oh , that 's the f the original .
Bmr019_830	So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber ; and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I didn't do it word level ,
Bmr011_1228	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm , OK . ; Yeah , but but just saying what the ; at that point
Bmr030_542	and you don't t really have control . ; Maybe we could do it from a w a PC or something . ; Wha ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1202	but I think that that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1206	I 'm ; But , um , ; OK . ; That 's good .
Bmr012_1187	yeah . ; Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless ; Yeah . ; But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .
Bro022_436	No . The DC component could be negligible . ; I mean , if you are recording it through a mike . ; I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1174	and we were we 're the ; we 're still a bit slow on feeding ; at that point we 've caught up ; and the the the , uh , the weak link is is recording meetings .
Bmr014_948	We can't just make it openly available on the web . ; No , no . ; You 're missing the point . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_392	So ; You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . ; Need to get it right . ; I mean , there 's no way to get around
Bed004_347	That 's kind of related to that . ; And then um in terms of the source , the things uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether ; Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one ; but uh whether the where I 'm currently at is a landmark might have a bearing on whether
Bmr013_145	are they reading actual phone numbers , ; Aurora I don't know . ; I don't know what they do in Aurora . ; or , a a digit at a time , or ?
Bmr009_1644	OK . Alright . ; Yeah , why don't you read the digits and then you can go . ; Oh , this is the new one . ; Yeah .
Bro022_1104	There are a few ; very ; not a lot of ; because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion ,
Bsr001_1450	But it will be all documented . ; Sorry . ; Yes . ; Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too
Bed003_837	So Tom Cruise 's house is not a public building ; but it has a door . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_700	it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ? ; No . ; No , it doesn't ; but what a super tool .
Bro012_467	No , point six uh percent absolute on Italian ; Worse . ; Worse , yep . ; Out of what ?
Btr002_335	because their intonation is totally different . ; You mean non - native na Non - native speakers ? ; I mean Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr021_586	Well , ; Right . ; So . ; You 're talking about different files .
Bed005_241	you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ? ; Yeah , I mean I changed those sentences to make it , uh , more , uh , idiomatic . ; And , of course , you can have i many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine . ; So , in a sense it 's pretty broad .
Bmr022_106	Oh ! ; So so if you get one ; Hmm . ; uh , uh , excuse me .
Bmr018_124	and then I 'm going down to San uh , San Jose Friday night , ; so , if you know , if we start nice and late Saturday that 's a good thing . ; No , I mean , they 're flying up from from ; Seattle .
Bmr011_812	I I I explained to him in in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . ; And , um , ; you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately ; and and the focus on reliability .
Bed005_1198	Well , pretty quickly . ; Right . ; U ; yeah , yeah .
Bmr018_202	I don't know , ; maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to to do . ; Um , ; I don't know ,
Bmr030_561	cuz he 's replacing them with these new ones . ; Maybe we could get one , ; and just dedicate it to doing this . ; Not even hook it u
Bro018_817	because the difference in performance is it 's not gigantic ; but it 's big enough that it it seems wrong . ; Yeah , ; I agree ,
Bmr003_1541	he he ; It was a lot funnier if you were there though . ; Uh , yeah , ; I know .
Bro018_482	I mean , it 'd be on the simple side , ; but ; Mm - hmm . ; uh um
Bmr022_1127	But ; Yeah . ; Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's it 's possible to recover from backups , ; so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded .
Bmr018_206	it seems to me w we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting ; because we 'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime . ; Yes ; except that if they had if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it , and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them
Bmr006_946	But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? ; What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? ; If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , ; Right , you can't analyse it .
Bro010_241	And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . ; No . ; What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , uh , the the the surgical , uh , uh , microscopes and so forth . ; Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh , finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ?
Bed010_1020	OK ? ; Oh , so in Switzerland . ; which is uh E P ; F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .
Bmr025_124	And so it it 's pretty big and complex . ; Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows ; because it means porting the web server to Windows . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_771	so ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1314	Um ; Yeah . ; Is that all OK ? ; And that one outcome , that 's
Bed013_761	So i so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side ; although it could reference the NTL - ish sort of , like , um , approach . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro026_536	Uh . ; So , I 'll , um I 'll actually after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case . ; So . ; It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD ,
Bmr028_877	And ; Yeah . We we should try ; We just don't know how bad it will be . ; I mean , one of the things that Dave was noticing we were talking this morning is that i it seems like and we do don't know this in detail , but it seems like you 're getting a lot from the channel adaptation , the speaker adaptation , and so forth .
Btr002_2742	Well they give the segmenter , though ; cuz they don't have the the rich interface that we do , ; so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt , ; " Well , there must be something there , um , whether I can hear it or not . "
Bmr008_1734	somethin something like that ; That 's true . ; That 's complicated . ; too .
Bro010_377	I don't know . ; Uh , ; What is the advantage of that ? ; Uh
Bro012_981	Um . It seems that after spectral subtraction , speech is more emerging now uh than than before . ; Mm - hmm . ; Speech is more what ? ; Well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger .
Bro014_584	and if it gets an unambiguous ; Oh , ; oh . I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_341	And So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . ; Not enough for others , right . ; And so I 'm looking and thinking , " Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_69	Oh , so they have a plenty of time , ; Yep . ; and y ; Given that it 's that long ,
Bmr024_805	Heidelberg ; Exactly ; Disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to , uh , get some more disk pretty soon . ; Do you wanna be a subject ?
Bdb001_325	or Is it ? ; I mean , it 's something that we developed at ICSI . ; But , uh ; But it 's been used here
Bns001_636	use current technology with a c a combination of mobile IP . So I think there is a lot of activities in the area . ; Uh . ; And my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here . ; But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind .
Bsr001_1234	And so I think that was that was gonna be ; and we were g Like someone actually has this knocking around . ; Some company that we were gonna uh , was gonna lend it to us , something like this . ; OK .
Bro003_965	uh , ; I 'm just kidding . ; when when I put these testings on there , I 'm assumi ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1021	or , uh , ; do we have one of these ; You know . I don't know . ; So , it th these are all possibilities .
Bmr009_77	It 's uh between the pauses uh for some segment . ; Oh . ; And so i i his his He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds . ; Oh .
Bmr024_1030	Is it is ? ; I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient . ; Wh ; Right .
Bro017_1208	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed011_389	Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s ki kills me . And we 're gonna put it on the web site . Yeah . ; Oh , we could get ; I mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , ; right ?
Bmr014_1045	or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything . ; I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . ; I I ; At least it more often .
Bmr020_751	because that 's what he cares about , ; and ; um , ; and also and then the the waveforms that Don segmented .
Bsr001_762	And so we are trying to push that . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1067	Yeah , right , ; OK . ; And then , uh , d uh , nine point , uh , one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_502	then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . ; So it adds forty milliseconds . ; a ; OK .
Bed017_694	but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there , ; eh anyway . ; So , um ; Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this ,
Bro024_1862	Yeah , I 'll try . ; but , yeah , ; Sunil in in your result it 's ; I I 'll try the cle
Bmr007_387	So . ; Not you , me . ; Were you ? ; Though it wasn't in the design .
Btr001_407	I mean , being ; I mean , not that I would know that . ; Mmm . ; But I just wondered if ,
Bed006_1341	When you this uh , ; Metacomment . ; eh ; Yeah . That 's all recorded .
Bmr001_382	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed004_513	And um this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify " OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case " , and so forth , it just gets really really messy . ; OK , I 'm sorry . ; You 're you 're ; Hmm ?
Bmr006_1271	Yeah . ; What looked different ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation .
Bmr014_651	We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . ; So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , ; and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . ; And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded .
Bmr026_1267	Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of ; yeah ; Uncle Bernie ; yeah .
Bmr027_176	Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; OK . I 'd I d ; Yeah . It 's the other group .
Bns003_611	from the work contributions , you know . ; Well , ; b but I think even also K P N . i is lost for the , uh , for the I C ; Yeah .
Bro023_1050	I mean , that was I just well , like the overall improvement is like fifty - six point five . ; Right . ; So , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_504	Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways . ; Mm - hmm . ; Good . ; Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place
Bed003_1385	um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , ; Yeah , that 's what it 's called . ; and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution ; and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues .
Bro003_2045	Because if you get all of them in there , that defines all of the phones . ; So that 's that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got got all the phones right . ; Right . ; So , if that doesn't help , there 's
Bro024_303	so so so they would ; So it 's within speaker , ; g s ; Yeah .
Bmr025_933	right ? ; No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , ; OK . ; it 's all digital .
Bro010_901	So you can imagine building many of these detectors on different features . ; You get enough of these detectors together , um , then you have enough information to do , um , higher level discrimination , ; for example , discriminating between phones ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1131	Right ? ; So um ; So it 's it 's ; I don't understand .
Bro011_192	Mm - hmm . ; in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about ; and that 's probably the best thing to do . ; And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there
Bmr013_278	Yeah . ; Place . ; Thank you , what whatev whatever I s said , that 's ; OK .
Bmr023_944	Well , he made it a parameter . ; He made it a parameter . ; So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it ; and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate ,
Bmr020_1698	Great . ; and that 's that somebody is playing sound from his laptop . ; Uh - huh ; And i the speech - nonspeech detector just assigns randomly the speech to to one of the channels ,
Bro005_1378	No . ; OK . ; Silent partner in the in the meeting . ; Oh , we got a laugh out of him ,
Bmr024_483	s ; I think , eight meetings or something which which I 'm using , ; and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_490	and then what the action planner does with it ; and how that is uh specified . ; I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant . ; Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention .
Bro005_206	Ah yes ! ; This h ; Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr005_950	That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . ; Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM . ; Right ? ; And then we don't know .
Bmr008_53	And I only did one copy which was really stupid of me . ; um So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around . ; So the top of it is uh , Name , Sex Email or Other Contact Information . ; And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , so that you can distinguish them ,
Bmr016_2061	I mean that would be the ; That was that was my motivation . ; Yeah . ; And i these can be changed , like I said .
Bns001_929	but I don't think that you are right in that sense . ; Well , think it works , ; but uh ; yes , the mapping of course between multicasting and the UMTS or or whatever
Bro004_409	or the other way around ? ; Something like that ? ; No . ; I thought there was something like that , that he showed me last week .
Bro028_119	Mmm . ; And this is still ? ; Uh , well , y you 're saying here . ; I c I should just let you go on .
Bed011_688	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Obviously taxis are very different than buses ,
Btr001_1607	Hmm . ; So , ; like , I I change time bins a lot , ; and I like will change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot ,
Bed005_160	OK . ; And the t and the time , right ? ; If if you 'd add add Today and Evening , it 'll add Time or not . ; So it i it does look at that .
Bed014_197	Well , let 's just pick whatever sounds best . ; Hmm ? ; Whatever sounds best . ; Uh .
Bro003_1562	Mustard . ; Mustard . ; OK . ; Yeah ,
Bro018_399	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I mean that they 're s probably working with fixed point or integer or something . ; I think you 're supposed to on this stuff anyway ,
Bmr011_724	Did I ? ; I 'm pretty sure . ; I don't know . ; Well I 'll I 'll get another one before the end of the meeting .
Bro024_577	Oh . ; Yeah . ; The reference drops like a very fast ; Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
Bmr006_1827	Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , ; So . ; and then , we wouldn't have to worry about it . ; OK .
Bmr028_620	Mm - hmm . ; and there 's about a half - second pause to a second in between and then another word , ; Yep . ; OK .
Btr001_1636	Yeah . ; And so ; I 'm ; Sometime I debate with myself whether it 's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually .
Bmr024_17	OK . ; So , uh ; uh , IBM transcription status , ; IBM transcription .
Bmr014_545	Hmm . ; And some of these are rather uh unexpected . ; Obscure , ; yeah .
Btr002_109	I wonder if that was someone who was who had an accent , maybe ? ; but ; Always conceivable . ; I don't remember off hand .
Bmr013_536	I wonder , how would you do a forced alignment ? ; I think so , too . ; Might ; Interesting idea .
Bed008_1232	Ah , sorry . ; I guess that 's ; You can technically wear that as you 're talking . ; Yeah , it 's right , I guess I can do that .
Bro014_1061	I have here one example if you if you want see something like that . ; and , ; Then we compute the difference . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1251	The four types . ; w And maybe we 'll expand that ; Um ; but the but the comments are , um , of four types mainly right now .
Buw001_607	They 're very sparse . ; I mean , I find it very hard to reconstruct what 's going on . ; I I don't know how ; Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about .
Btr001_220	or ? ; Um , yeah ; well , I studied I mean , I studied Old English for a while . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_721	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I remember when I was when I I I I used , uh , um , a prominent laboratory 's , uh , uh , speech recognizer ; Is
Bmr010_644	You couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ? ; Yep . ; Huh ! ; When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it
Bed009_455	OK . ; Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ? ; So that 's that 's really something we ; Yep .
Bro013_751	OK . ; But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if ; because here you only have zeros ; No , they just write
Bmr016_2206	Great . ; have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel ; Uh , for for a total of like twenty m ; f for a total of
Bmr030_436	Yeah , so how do we do that ? ; How would we put ; Get a tape deck , ; Yeah .
Bed016_433	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Kind of a different level of analysis . ; The yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things ,
Bmr020_1714	That 's life . ; It 's a little bit confusing . ; Yeah . ; I mean , what 're we gonna do ?
Bmr006_698	Wow ! ; but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool .
Bro027_1949	All the other ones were five percent , ; the ; I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now , ; Yeah .
Bro008_532	Yeah . ; Also , uh , I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . ; So one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other ; Well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different
Bed003_1804	So now I think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh ; Mm - hmm . ; not ex it 's implicit that the person wants to enter , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1053	Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange ; because nnn , they they make LDA ; and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , ; Yeah . It 's a little strange
Bro017_641	Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor , ; you know , ; uh in the ; Oh .
Bdb001_1354	and use that . ; And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between . ; Right . ; Yeah , exactly .
Bed006_746	and you can see here , ; and again for Johno please please focus the shadow , ; OK . ; um we 're gon
Bmr010_230	Mm - hmm . ; but but Yeah , it 's a ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro019_136	and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . ; So , ; there 's a lot of nice features to it ; and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines
Bns003_618	and nothing is possible anymore , ; so . ; Um , so from your side the statement is , um , that , uh , independently of your person uh , the KPN is not they 're not willing to send us another guy here to ICSI anyway . ; Yes .
Btr002_91	Right . ; And then there are various ones like , um , um , " ish decay " instead of " HTK " . ; Oh . ; Ugh !
Bmr029_486	Well , that 's more of a problem . ; I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of gene ; I mean you can pretend it 's all from one speaker ; and do all this processing the same ,
Bed017_260	So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh ; because , um ,
Bmr020_518	And we just eyeballed ; I mean we didn't really hand - tag all of these things . ; We just looked at the distribution of words , ; and so every " so yeah " , and " OK " , uh , and " uh - huh " were were the were deemed to be backchannels
Bmr005_718	Sure sure . ; Sure , ; because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_288	We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know , second to second coding of when they occur . ; I I ; I I ; I 'm I 'm I 'm confused now .
Bmr016_1844	Don and I were just noticing , ; love this one over on page three , ; " vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . " ; That 's great .
Bns002_435	Yeah , you cannot ; Could it not be a little bit strange ; because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes , he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to to whatever . ; No , no , no .
Bro005_696	Ah , yes . ; Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , ; I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the ; OK .
Bmr023_1021	Mm - hmm . ; But one thing we could do is ; Let let me let me just ask you something . ; When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs
Bro024_1232	Is this is this VAD a MLP ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; How how big is it ?
Buw001_1968	One less action item . ; Um ; OK . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . ; Can I ask , uh , one thing ?
Bro018_743	To come up with the phones ? ; Um ; or to come up with these vectors to see how closely they match the phones , ; Oh .
Btr002_566	Is better ? ; Is better . ; Ah , it 's a wider band then . ; Because of
Bmr001_775	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean there 's it 's If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , probably . ; OK .
Bro025_545	So , that 's the ; So that 's something you could do with , um , this final system . ; Right ? ; Just do this everything that is in this final system except , uh , use the channel zero .
Bns002_708	This is the next . ; Yeah , th ; is it not possible to extend the power until the maximum ; u
Bed002_886	I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . ; And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? ; So , you first have to do this , and that , ; Yep .
Bmr015_1038	Well ; But ; An - any application may have to . ; No .
Bro027_1423	But I mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I know . ; That that Yeah .
Btr001_1490	Huh . ; Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where there 'd be a misunderstanding about like ; like ; Morgan would be speaking but it 'd be on your channel ,
Bsr001_366	I mean , ; apical - alveolar kind of thing . ; Yeah . ; I don't know .
Bmr028_1491	Same cheating . ; And then then , even if you know that , can that help you ? ; I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ? ; Hmm .
Bro022_510	Ex - exactly . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , you got it . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_576	Yeah . ; but ; Yeah , I was interested when I saw the twenty - four on there . ; Oh , yeah !
Bns003_646	I 'm ; Right now I 'm interested and I 'm looking into it ; and I 'm working started yesterday , actually working on it , ; to do the , uh u to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark , um , on an open - source router that 's different from the one that of Mark 's project .
Bro018_483	but ; Mm - hmm . ; uh um ; you know , if uh uh the example I was giving was that if if you had um onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right .
Bmr022_867	OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh , because cuz we 've had With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time , uh , we 've really had no tr no trouble with this at all , ; So I 'll just go d I 'll do that .
Bns003_874	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_837	I know . ; So you should call it , like , " digits start time " . Or . ; And I haven't said anything . ; Yep .
Bed003_1647	That will be one one thing we could do . ; I actually uh , have Um , ; also we can uh , start looking at the SmartKom tables ; and I will
Bmr027_75	You just felt you wanted to ? ; Jane told me July fifteenth . ; So , that 's what I set it . ; Oh , OK .
Buw001_463	But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , ; and get the notes from the note - taker or something . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_901	Clever . ; Yeah . ; Excellent . ; Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that um , there could be other differences between the uh already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has just r been run through his process .
Bed003_1421	I mean the u u ; Hmm . ; It 's in the these these these plan schemas . ; I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate ,
Bed010_162	It 's just for closure . ; So that if we come up with a question of " could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? " or something . ; You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in . ; Right .
Buw001_1631	Yeah . ; uh , ; Um , ; mostly together .
Bsr001_2321	by the way , eight ! " ; Uh - huh . ; Mmm . ; So you don't need the meeting for that .
Bed013_490	And ; uh , both learning and like , comprehension , production , that kinda stuff . ; Psycho . ; You could look at the web site .
Bed015_1393	which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this . ; Right . ; Exactly . ; I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff
Bmr028_983	Actually , no . Th - th ; Sorry . ; A Are the models gender - dependent ? ; Mmm .
Bed008_901	Mm - hmm . ; It does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . ; Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . ; Right .
Bmr002_1149	Right . ; So . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro011_625	Yeah , yeah . ; And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , ; but um . ; So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end .
Buw001_1823	My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it ; Mmm . ; He would never use it . ; but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel .
Bmr008_801	Yeah , I think those are good . ; OK . ; they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these , ; I 'm Canadian , or
Bro027_365	OK . ; Oh . ; So this is now it 's it 's compiled under Solaris ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_790	Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that . ; So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr003_919	Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ? ; That would be the automatic boundaries . ; No , no , no , no . ; No , no .
Bro008_541	That was a question that was kind of raised by Mike Shire 's thesis , and on in that case in terms of reverberation . ; Right ? ; That that sometimes it might be better to do that . ; But , um , I don't think we know for sure .
Bro023_1100	I see . ; Yeah , ; Yeah . ; plus , uh , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well .
Bed006_1017	Right . ; so what is the ; Snack action . ; uh is is there a " buying s snacks " schema ?
Bmr009_1281	but they might have something ; Right . ; It just And we ; because it is easier to have it open ended .
Bed013_999	So , we may think that if you say um , " where is the theater " , um , whether or not he has talked about tickets before , then we he 's probably wanna go there to see something . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Or " where is the opera in Par - Paris ? ,
Bmr005_1153	So this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that that ? ; The a apparently I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . ; Um ; but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings .
Bmr008_58	And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background . ; And we could do profession , but it 's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level . ; um At least that would get at some idea of their background . ; So I have a And s
Bro007_24	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The graph ,
Bro014_1544	um ; Don't know . ; But anyway it sounds like a reasonable way to go for a for an initial thing , ; and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing
Bro018_939	Uh - huh . ; And so um ; you just for continuity you just approximate them by by the second to highest and second to lowest . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_845	I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty , ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; and I didn't realize there was " uh oh I 'm about to read this and I should "
Bro023_1701	the next thing I started to do is to , uh , try to develop a better voice activity detector . ; And , ; um ; I d
Bro023_1420	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_749	um . That 's uh , I 'm I 'm keeping on good terms with Jan . ; You 've noticed that . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro021_20	everybody going around and saying , uh , you know , what they 're working on , ; the things that happened the last week . ; But aside from that is there anything in particular that anybody wants to bring up ; Mmm .
Bro007_162	What else did we have in there ? ; Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is ; I I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit ; uh And you you yellowed these out
Bmr016_1857	Yeah , that 's it . ; That was the I was imitating uh , beeping out ; Beep . ; Perfect .
Bsr001_287	Yeah . ; It 's very comfortable . ; But I mean , ; And you just have to bring it up .
Bed010_24	It doesn't know " I " . ; OK . ; Um , the uh ; Oh ,
Buw001_1353	I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , ; which for me is actually the dominant thing , ; because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , ; but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up .
Bro021_1126	well , we can apply first order of the vector st Taylor series of the of the of well , the order that we want , increase the complexity of the problem . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then when we have a expression , uh , for the mean and variance of the noisy speech , we apply a technique of minimum mean - square estimation ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_399	So we were ; Uh , and it 's point eight ? ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_779	I 'm sor ; Well , um , the question is that ; Well . ; Remove some noise but not too much .
Bed017_567	W yeah , I know , I mean it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him . ; which in the ; I think uh , ; Absolutely . Yeah .
Bmr029_670	or do you want me to talk to him ? ; I , uh , I I can talk to him . ; OK . ; And then the bottom one in terms of the test will be ?
Bsr001_482	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; There 's just no other way around it .
Bed015_550	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; or something . Right ? ; So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level .
Bmr012_1300	Great . ; Super . ; I 'm really sorry I have to g ; no I have to go as well .
Bmr009_1431	How do you spell it ? ; I think that 's fine . ; Cockney ? ; CO
Btr002_1847	Yes . It was one of these it was this kind of deal . ; Oh yeah , I had that one . ; Yeah ! Y yeah ! ; Oh yeah .
Bed015_1718	Nuh ? ; So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue . ; Yeah . ; No , but there 's there 's a Gricean thing going on there ,
Bmr003_2170	Yeah . ; Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording . ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1797	It 's not a ; I mean , you there 're all these words that I could imagine ; and so , it 's like , it 's a " tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop " . ; And that 's that 's not really very helpful .
Bmr009_181	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But yeah , even so .
Bed012_385	So is ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_1503	Mm - hmm . ; Exactly right . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_790	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech .
Bro021_1028	Right ? ; And that 's what you seem to be saying . ; No . ; It 's not . But this is the same
Bmr024_88	and ; Yep . ; So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about ; Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting .
Bmr022_515	And it certainly was not a minute a chunk , ; it was a few seconds a chunk . ; That 's what I ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2007	Sampling rate in the end . ; What ? ; One one thing we do know is that we 're we 're all producing NIST Sphere files in in , uh , eh in the standard format . ; Yeah .
Bro024_475	Uh . ; Do you wanna go , Sunil ? ; Maybe we 'll just start with you . ; Yeah .
Bed010_492	Yeah , I mean I I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , ; Hmm . ; and um , it kind of sounded like I didn't want to trudge through that , you know . ; It was just Strange ,
Bmr029_152	That 's what I was thinking . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1123	OK . ; Um , I know I have something in the morning , which I don't normally have . ; I don't remember off the top of my head when it ends . ; Um , I 'll let you know if it 's it 'll be a problem
Bmr012_301	I 'll show you the point . ; Yeah . ; It it had no effect on my transcription , ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1662	put the beeps file , ; send it off to IBM . ; You know ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_850	It 's a cross - correlation filter . ; So I I haven't tried that , but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little . ; So , some thought of maybe having ; Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .
Bmr013_866	Then lots of ; Right . ; so it 's like , ; uh You know I hadn't , uh , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example ,
Bed014_1325	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; No , right . I mean , tha that role is is , uh , indispensable
Bmr029_855	let 's see , um ; Yeah . And if not I can retrain those models very quickly . ; Oh , there 's there 's one other issue , ; uh , and that is that Dave throws out speakers that have less than twelve seconds of training data .
Bro005_123	But ; um this this net performed quite well . ; Well , ; it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only .
Bed017_431	Like you know that when somebody 's working about uh , working on on servlets for example , ; he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used are written in Java . ; So some some inferences like that , ; now , um , u using this you can infer more information ,
Bmr031_1318	or for unspecified speech . ; And , um , so ; Oh ! ; so , uh , they 'll I sent them our recognition output
Bmr014_1078	All ; Oh they won't ? ; no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time . ; Oh good .
Bro023_92	And , um , ; that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like ; And , um , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . ; So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time ,
Bmr024_289	And so I 've uh , I , uh , uh , I 've trained the new one uh , the new the newest one , to , um , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . ; And that 's just amazingly helpful . ; Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . ; Oh , right .
Bmr016_1464	Well , we 're not doing We 're not doing length . ; Quick Thilo , do a do a filled pause for us . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Ooo no .
Btr001_1510	Yeah . ; Um . ; They 're very fast . ; That 's amazing .
Bmr020_1107	And that 's where your your data would be very important to have . ; So , I will ; Um ; Yeah and hopefully the new meetings which will start from the channelized version will will have better time boundaries and alignments .
Bmr014_546	And some of these are rather uh unexpected . ; Obscure , ; yeah . ; But ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .
Bro005_1213	You you folks have been looking at this more than me . ; But my impression was that uh , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay , ; Yeah . ; but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better ,
Bmr028_1758	That 's fine . ; Hmm . ; Oh , good question . ; You know what ?
Bmr006_495	There we go . ; Oh , I like that . ; That 's right . ; Well put . Well put .
Bed003_136	Architecturally appealing from the outside . ; or something like that . ; But see the thing is , if it 's ; OK .
Bed002_248	So , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . ; Maybe you want to enter a building . ; Maybe you want to see it , ; take a picture of it .
Btr001_2517	" Oh , but I don't mean the transcribers we have here of course . " ; Oh . ; Like Well sometimes he 'll do that , ; yeah .
Bro026_346	So ; I It is a triumph . ; Yeah . ; Their their first system is fifty - four point something .
Bro024_1911	OK . ; No ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro007_351	Maybe maybe they 'll argue about it . ; Um OK ; so if we can know what how many words are in each ; and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday
Bed008_657	Yeah . ; I mean , we could . ; Yeah . ; And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also
Bed016_876	That 's that 's computa should be very computational , ; you know , like ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1041	I mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things , ; but there 's also this sort of like causal , ; well , so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of a compound action of some kind , which has structure . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1865	OK , ; now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech . ; Yes . ; Yes .
Btr002_2797	Hmm ! ; I guess I try to be more careful in my speech , more often . ; Good . ; Unless I 'm really not paying any attention
Btr001_766	you It sounded like " great " ; if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like " great " . ; Uh - huh . ; But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the K or whatever and a little bit of the R .
Bro021_951	No ? ; Oh , maybe it 's I am ; I 'm problem . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1524	So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But it seems like if we just wanna get something to work ,
Bro003_954	Uh , ; so that 's ; Yeah . One hundred each , about . ; hundred and hundred and fourteen each .
Bmr018_1345	No . ; No . ; It 's just informal . ; No , we just had some discussions , various discussions with them .
Bsr001_1154	That 's to the listeners . ; Yeah . ; Too bad you weren't here . ; You know , maybe thousands of people are listening to us now
Bed009_902	and so . ; Right . ; But it it it doesn't look like i you 're using it . ; I didn't n see it being used in the current template uh parser .
Bmr007_333	Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker . ; Yeah . ; I mean what I thought what I would have thought in is that when there were a large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , but uh apparently not . ; That 's interesting .
Bmr029_568	So , I mean But that 's another research thing to do ; and probably won't get done the next week . ; Right . So what what is the schedule here ? ; Well , I mean , I 'm I 'm leaving for for the , uh , the New Orleans meeting , uh , next Saturday ,
Bro017_297	OK . ; And that 's what that 's what I 'm saying then , ; so this is a this is a starting vector . ; It 's just like shortened f spectrum , or something .
Bmr002_1274	I want those things to work . ; And so I would like to get that done as quickly as possible . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , if if Liz or someone else wants to do some work on uh prosody and on stress and so on then we can go back to the data and generate the uh the transcripts that we need .
Bmr007_909	Because , I I I think it 's more realistic that , uh only consider the the the the silence between the speaker . ; Eh there there exists eh silence between between , eh a speaker . ; is is , eh eh acoustic , eh event , important to to consider . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_514	OK . ; Not consider the log energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_211	Ah , come on . ; We should keep a list of things we 're gonna bleep out and the conditions under which ; Well , I 'm just joking . ; So , you do not have to bleep that out .
Bmr011_215	so , um , yeah , the transcribers notice ; And in fact there 're some where , um ; ugh ; well , I mean there 's it 's the double thing .
Bro025_91	And , uh , I mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing ; but the math is a little different ; so that there 's a a there 's an exponent difference in the index ; you know , what 's the ideal filtering ,
Bmr003_712	First of all the time marking you 'd get you could get by a tool . ; Wow . ; That 's true . ; And so if the if if the issue really
Bro004_1214	So it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . ; So this might just be a temporary thing . ; But But , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . ; So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been
Bed011_72	and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . ; And he has a handout . ; Yeah . ; Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .
Bmr009_307	um Because something is a good feature uh by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination ; and so it 's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form . ; There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way . ; But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have have some uh some hope
Bed002_1022	So , how should What 's the uh , plan ? ; Like , how should we go about figuring out these ; OK . So , first of all is , ; uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ?
Bmr003_2524	and they said , " sure , ; whenever you want " . ; So I think it won't be a problem . ; Oh , cool .
Bed005_1382	When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools i i ; Like , i i it it may be , that , the the instance ; w That we have to build our own instance , uh , things , that , with their types , ; Yeah , it 's
Btr002_877	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . I see what you 're saying . ; OK . OK .
Bro010_369	Mm - hmm . ; KLT , ; Uh - huh . ; I 'm sorry .
Btr002_2340	So , and then of course there are these these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data ; which are these funny sounds people make , ; which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk . ; So , I notice people going , " Pfft " you know , if they 're trying to say something is done .
Bmr010_1175	I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back back when Chuck was here ; in early times , ; is we would take , ; um , da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation
Btr002_2999	although that 's that 's not necessary . ; It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ , ; Mm - hmm . ; they do this thing .
Bed015_1863	Right . ; No . ; Maybe . ; Yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like " speaker believes not - P " ,
Bro003_361	but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . ; So so I think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . ; Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal . ; And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch .
Bmr031_1117	Right . ; So what I don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles ; and it display wavefiles . ; I just haven't done that
Bed009_168	um ; well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data . ; Yeah obviously . ; um um Not this type of data ,
Bro023_1443	Yeah , I wasn't thinking of that one in particular ; but more of , you know , if if there is some part of your system that has to buffer twenty frames , uh , can't the other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_258	and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o um entities and real world places you will find in Heidelberg . ; And um . ; So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , ; such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide " OK , I wanna do that at this place " ,
Btr002_2462	a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , " mouth " is fine . ; Mm - hmm . ; The It seems like the computer science people use " lipsmack " for that . ; I Personally , my choice
Bro023_769	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , ; I mean So this is like the noise compensation f is fixed
Bed014_646	Yeah . ; I wanna " ; " Here 's my plan for today . ; Here 's my plan for tomorrow . "
Bro017_1021	Right . ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Absinthe .
Bro015_64	Yeah . ; Nothing much . ; Yeah . ; Probably the um these weight things , they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for TI - digits than for the SpeechDat - Car .
Bro012_212	Yeah . ; Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that ; Well . ; Eh uh
Bns001_209	So , ; let 's switch to the proposal . ; I ask everybody whether read it in the meantime , and understand everything . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1290	Um I don't know what the ; One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much , uh things could be helped by more parameters . ; And uh And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have , in terms of the uh computational limits . ; Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters ,
Bro012_1143	Yeah . ; uh there is the first formant , which is the larger ; and then voiced sound are more high frequencies ; cuz it 's frication
Btr002_1916	I 'm fine . ; I can stay . ; I don't have to be anywhere until five , ; Sure .
Bed005_1407	Well , I me ye eh , yeah , the ; That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess . @ @ . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute . ; I mean , you 've been around enough to
Bro023_1427	and first frame has a twenty framed latency . ; So you can't r rely on that latency all the time . ; Yeah . ; Because
Bed009_977	Right . ; yeah . ; We 're just gonna foreshadow what we saw that ; Right .
Bro017_935	Well . ; right ? ; I mean , it 's predictable . ; Uh . Yeah .
Bed010_394	Why ; HUGIN . ; And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . ; So then , in any case , um
Bsr001_948	probably . ; But yeah , they they have ; Uh - huh . ; And and it 's hard to even follow what they 're saying .
Bro013_268	I Yeah . I think it 's it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; So . Yes . ; But
Bmr012_1159	Yes . ; OK . ; I don't know ; but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal .
Bmr028_1621	because often the recording person isn't in the room . ; Oh , I see . ; So , what are you gonna do ? ; I mean it will w the person if you 're looking up at the board and I disable the screensaver , you will see that the mike is off ,
Bed006_1240	So if I want to go from outside to inside then you 'd have the roles that need to filled , where you 'd have a Source - Path - Goal set of roles . ; So you 'd the Source would be outside and Path is to the door or whatever , ; right ? ; Right .
Bmr026_680	Liz and Jane probably . ; OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting . ; Uh . Uh , if you wanna put it that way . ; Good thing Liz isn't here .
Bns001_1521	Uh Anyway , but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available . ; The good thing is that the money is available , ; because everybody is paid here . ; So that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available .
Bmr006_1536	OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have " Roger " be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was " Roger " be " Frank " , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . ; Oh . ; Ugh ! ; That 's a good point .
Bro011_636	I see . ; and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own ; um It doesn't require its own training data , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_284	I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent . ; Yeah . ; Well , one thing , so you understand he he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ? ; Yes .
Bmr018_1658	That 's a big one . ; you know , ; so so these , I mean th the in the in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you ; if you uh
Btr002_872	the middle ; How do you mean " expand " ? ; What do you mean by " expand " ? ; Oh , uh , in terms of , um , if , uh if it 's it 's if it 's cut off ,
Bro004_1422	is pretty tricky to parallelize . ; But you could split up the sentences in a test set . ; They have a they have a thing for doing that ; and th they have for awhile , in H T
Bmr031_734	You just partition them into multiple . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So that 's probably the next step ,
Bed011_699	I 've only ev was there ten years ago , for a day , so I don't remember , but . ; Mm - Well , ; I mean , like the sort of the tourist - y bits ; Everywhere .
Bro010_217	And then someone else does something that 's straight forward . ; So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise ; and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . ; Right .
Bns002_1288	assuming that another Bluetooth or several Bluetooth networks c will be could be in the same area of space ; and they are using the same hopping technology , frequency hopping technology . ; But again , this technology is uh trying to avoid the other networks by choosing different hopping patterns . ; So uh if several Bluetooth networks can can uh coexist without a problem , I don't see any problem will will happen if if we want to to make coexist one uh Bluetooth with another wireless uh local area network technology .
Bed002_767	Mm - hmm . ; u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , ; Mm - hmm . ; so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that ,
Bmr018_654	but it would be ; But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr003_1011	And then they they do a clean up . ; But it 's gonna be horrible . ; They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . ; What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ?
Btr002_1985	Yeah . ; It really is strange . ; Yeah . ; I it lead us it ta if we w
Bed011_1082	Correct . ; Oh yeah yeah . ; V a half a page is is what we 'd like . ; Yeah .
Bro017_976	I mean it was just , you know , incredibly high score , and so that was throwing everything off . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1590	yeah . ; For both . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2138	Who specifically ask not to be . ; Like Jane , for example . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro021_660	cuz it 's the log of of K times a complex number , ; then you can just that 's the same as log of K plus log of the complex number . ; Oh . ; OK .
Bmr003_913	Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to ; Well , but couldn't I do it for the next ; We we we could get fake ; Oh , I see what you mean .
Bmr020_1575	Yeah , it 's perhaps then it 's perhaps five percent of something , ; which s uh the the frames speech frames which are which are missed , ; but um , I can't can't really tell . ; Right .
Bmr018_1140	Right , right . ; yeah . ; Overall . ; I did go through one of these meetings .
Bro012_1282	or uh pre pre uh pre - nonlinearity , ; Yeah . ; i if ; uh and do the KLT on the on on that ,
Bed002_409	which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , ; that the person wants to uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . ; Um . ; So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed .
Bro027_311	OK . ; And , uh , on that , I mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those ; And so they 've picked the values . ; Yeah , I think they pi p
Bro019_1435	um , other than that , uh , I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years . ; Oh no . ; So you live in a cardboard box in the street now ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1085	And the transcription conventions ; I , uh uh It shouldn't be done . ; You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to you might contract out to do the transcription ? ; Yes .
Bed006_542	based on the English , ; you know , in English . ; So . ; I was like " OK ,
Bmr002_223	OK . ; And ; So , a short sentence between each line . ; It really sounds like sentences .
Bmr024_492	but , um , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than ; But ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_620	Improvement . ; Improvement . ; Yeah . ; That 's " Percentage increase " is the percentage improvement over the baseline .
Bmr014_386	Nine two , ; e Exactly . ; right . ; So if you just say " nine two " , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed .
Bro024_1410	but with uh , Wiener filtering from um , France Telecom included . ; Um , so this gives like fifty - seven point seven percent , uh , s uh , error rate reduction on the SpeechDat - Car data . ; Mmm , ; and then I have two sheets where it 's for a system where
Bsr001_2323	Mmm . ; So you don't need the meeting for that . ; You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones . ; But you need the room and the set up .
Bro016_524	So . ; Um , it 's somewhat tuned . ; It 's tuned more than , you know , a a a a ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_661	That 's you know if if there are more machines um uh here ; plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs ; um ; certainly doable .
Bro025_480	So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed . ; I see . ; And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_565	Yeah . ; And so . ; Yeah . ; We are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction
Bro003_1809	Yeah . ; So wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing . ; Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it training a net on that , say , um , from from , uh from TIMIT or something . ; Is that or uh , for multiple databases .
Buw001_2015	On the task , and the task . ; It 's just ; I just wanted to uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_376	right ? ; Yeah . ; It is a reservation mechanism , ; Yeah .
Bed017_71	which as of this morning should be resolved . ; Good . ; And , so , ; " should be " means they aren't yet ,
Bmr005_404	Yeah . ; So then , in the region between since there there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . ; If ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_597	That 'd be really great . ; OK . ; And we 'd still have some funding for this project , ; I can do that .
Bmr022_504	Yeah . ; W if it 's a hundred , then you know , that 's not the issue , ; but if it 's a hundred , then , the average length of each one is pretty pretty long ; and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal .
Bns002_1471	that we put the pieces together . ; Because I believe many are very flexible here ; accounting also the future - coming uh joining people of the NSA group , to do some work here . ; And if we are starting with a very very very small cluster with a common activity have maybe some starting funding for bigger uh radius of the of the the the uh project proposal , with the mind that maybe at the final stage it will becoming a European proposal with this uh the the whole funding .
Bro027_841	No . ; Yeah ? ; Um , so it 's makes forty - five features that are used as input to the HTK . ; And then , there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem MLP .
Bns001_1029	But now , the first generation of web - browsers are in the ha and and uh I would say " handies " , ; I i ; so that 's wrong in the mobile phones , ; but the the next generation of networks are still available .
Bmr003_2564	Um ; When people talk , it they go on and off . ; This ; So again , Washington wants to equip a system .
Bmr007_1203	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but for software it 's probably better for it to be silence . ; No , no .
Bmr003_2607	What ? ; It 's nice it 's nice to be thinking toward that . ; Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer . ; Well , actually shorten
Bmr021_6	It 's probably the P Z ; Yeah . ; So , I think we pre - crashed , ; so I think we 're OK .
Bro013_683	the idea is that um normally an analysis frames are um too short to encompass reverberation effects um in full . ; You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window ; and so you you 'd like it to be that um the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , ; but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames
Bmr020_1721	Even a hand - transcription would ; Do you ; a hand - transcriber would have trouble with that . ; Yeah ,
Bro012_1476	Uh . ; O K . ; Can I just mention one other interesting thing ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_769	Mm - hmm . ; We were th ; But uh I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . ; I 'm not I don't know if I totally am happy with the way it is .
Bro011_641	Mm - hmm . ; So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , ; but um ; i So I wanna play with that a little bit more .
Bro013_618	Separate thing ? ; Yeah . ; And . ; Yeah .
Bed002_39	Um . ; Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone 's here . ; Mmm . ; Well , we have one more coming .
Btr001_325	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , he was hard . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1048	Huh . ; Well we we have a problem with that , ; you know , time - wise on a ; It - it 's a lot slower to load in a long file ,
Bro022_868	Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic ,
Bmr003_1875	OK . ; We can write ; Web site 's nice . ; Oh .
Bmr030_629	Yeah , it 's a p hundred meg . ; They 're the beep files . ; That 's right . ; So they 're smaller .
Bro024_673	We can't do it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr028_511	And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know . ; I mean ; Just we certainly have their email . ; But I knew everybody in the NSA meetings .
Btr002_2982	That 's what I usually do too . ; Right . ; I was wondering who had been putting those in . ; Yeah .
Bro010_748	But what you 're saying , you know , makes sense , though . ; I mean , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , uh , the center of the center of the window . ; But ; uh , we 're already having problems with these delay , uh delay issues .
Bro008_317	And so , um ; Yeah , so perhaps we could have a a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply . ; Mm - hmm . ; And which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but which is perhaps important for noisy speech .
Bed003_1213	um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes ; uh , I don't know if that might be ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up .
Bro021_611	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; P So .
Bed015_1050	linear time , linear spaces , ; like , you know , are are they doing something serially ; or is it like , ; um , uh I 'm I 'm not sure .
Buw001_2218	I don't know why ; I didn't do this before and I regret it . ; So that was very interesting for me . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_620	I w ; No matter how we want to call it , this is sort of our playground . ; And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to to maybe enable a whole simulation , one of these days , that would be u the the perfect goal . ; Right .
Bed004_191	No , I don't know . ; Not that I know of . ; Right . ; Well , there is witch and warlock ,
Bro003_1036	there 's ; That would be ; Uh , ; yeah ,
Buw001_1291	some some of the little things that would be hidden . ; And and that might be something people are willing to stay for . ; Boy , I I don't know how we get at this ; That would be interesting .
Bmr008_1521	but ; Sure . ; But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time . ; Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it .
Bro004_572	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . Uh . ; Well , I mean , let 's see . ; Is there any difference in
Btr001_1877	And like turn around and be like , " Wait , that person doesn't look anything like I imagined them . " ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_413	Um There is the format of the table which is quite impressive . ; Yeah ? ; Uh I see . ; Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny .
Bmr002_1268	but only once we have a consumer of that data ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; ' You know , so right now we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change .
Bmr021_719	so to be comparable , I trained uh um on a sh on a so - called short training set ; um a male system and a female system , ; and uh ; also for debugging purposes , and for the heck of it , I trained um trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the SRI front - end from scratch ,
Bro025_321	Yeah . So so what happened right now , we removed the delay of the LDA . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1497	and this it sounds bizarre ; but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , ; like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . ; And so I was thinking if there 's any like Berkeley political groups or something .
Bed009_192	and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ? ; Probably something that we specified in M - three - L , ; Mmm . ; that is @ @ " action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower " .
Bed005_871	Mm - hmm . ; If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there 's no obligation on any of this .
Bro028_884	In principle . ; I didn't read carefully how they actually implemented it , ; I see . ; Hmm .
Bed013_76	Or uh , ; you remember , in the the hand thing in one - eighty - two , like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations . ; You mean that sort of thing ? ; Absolutely .
Bro010_886	um and he said there 's like twenty of these per per sub - band . ; Um , ; and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , um , " I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_492	Mm - hmm . ; who , uh But he he he won't be in the country that long , ; and , ; maybe another will end up .
Bmr003_1318	Yeah , ; Yeah , yeah , ; French . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_213	Yes , yes ! ; Oh , OK interesting . ; That that Right ? that that , um ; Yeah .
Bmr007_350	It 's just that people haven't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm ? ; So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting ,
Bmr013_654	Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet , ; uh , I mean we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh , couple examples of . But but , uh , ; Yeah , m ; Yeah .
Bmr013_355	it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you ; Mm - hmm . ; because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . ; Right .
Btr001_213	you know . ; Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ . ; What 's ; you 've studied some languages ,
Bmr030_727	So what what ; Or ? ; The new disks are installed . ; If you need space just let me know .
Bmr011_391	Yeah . ; if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . ; And if if someone 's talking on on on , uh , one side or the other , it goes the other way . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_4	Uh . Alright . ; So . I uh uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news . ; Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week . ; Don't know which days yet .
Bro015_28	but it 's I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here . ; So . ; But y I don't know maybe June . ; Maybe earlier .
Bns002_535	It 's always true that only one node gets a media access , for one frame . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's the point .
Bmr003_1167	Right . ; So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? ; Yeah . ; But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour .
Bmr003_2129	They sorta look like this . ; Oh . ; What does that mean ? ; That 's the s that 's British for speed bump ,
Buw001_91	and , um , uh , you you put up there data format , ; Um . ; and other tasks during data collection , ; So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get
Bro016_1152	that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan . ; By the way , ; um , ; there 's , uh , a couple people who are gonna be here
Bmr002_979	I I love it when they ; But I 've never downloaded it . ; c ; Someone mentioned it to me .
Bmr008_1791	Yep . ; but eh is ; Anyway , we 're we 're missing snacks here , ; so uh let 's let 's let 's let 's do our let 's do our digits
Bro004_1060	No . ; Yeah , ; uh for example , LDA filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . ; Yes .
Bro003_1015	Here . ; Just ; Oh , yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_629	but ; That 's possible . ; you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ? ; I don't know ,
Bmr003_2223	So , we it 'll have to be convention . ; What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered .
Buw001_1995	But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over ; and and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW . ; So , I think that that there 's a good chance we could get more variety . ; OK .
Bmr008_1792	but eh is ; Anyway , we 're we 're missing snacks here , ; so uh let 's let 's let 's let 's do our let 's do our digits ; Oh , OK .
Bns003_889	my last point , uh , in principle , is the proposal itself . ; Um ; I know , in the past it was always if I 'm not writing something nothing gonna happen . ; So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity .
Bns002_673	So , the idea in this first work was to obtain a fixed value for the transmission range . ; And the second eh work , uh , it is about ; Oops ! ; It is about uh , an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for every for every single transmission .
Bmr028_485	Very helpful . ; Yeah , I didn't actually see who they all were . ; Um , a couple of them were , like , people at IBM who were here for one of the IBM meetings ; Yeah .
Bro019_152	and then I fired off a recognition job ; and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , " uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously ; s my m my jobs are not getting run . " ; So I had to back off a little bit .
Bed003_279	Right . ; Got it . ; But uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_1477	Mmm . ; Like , that 's another one I see all the time , where you assume it 's known . ; Yeah . Sure . ; Oh , interesting .
Bro024_1241	six thousand hidden nodes and two outputs . ; t t ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1583	Oh . ; They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that they hadn't had time to do it . ; And uh so it 's likely that this this may be entered into the ch this central @ @ . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_324	Because , it 's not , um , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . ; Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . ; Do you mean , ; Yeah .
Bns002_815	because it 's really a random movement . ; Then I still hear ; this is during the data transmission . ; Yeah , but again again , what we are adding with this behavior is , uh uh a little bit more , probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate .
Bmr006_786	One or two or more . ; One , two , three . ; but ; No , by th by the moment n Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Bed006_1716	yeah , It 's fine ; so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say " well if you really look at it , you just need our RAD . " ; You can throw the rest away , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1550	So . ; We we could do that but that would mean changing the code . ; I mean this isn't a program we wrote . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_94	So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data ; and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , ; so the front - end is the user interface ; and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool .
Bmr013_195	Not after lunch . ; OK , so , um , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . ; And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . ; Yeah .
Bed012_393	What what what I am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities . ; And now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , ; that looks at all the values and says , " The winner is Timing . ; Now , go there . "
Btr002_220	Yes . ; Mm - hmm . ; But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , new word , like capitalized " So " . ; Oh .
Bed005_715	and the database , and stuff . ; So it isn't like , um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that . ; Right . ; I i it
Bmr023_938	And so well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that ; and so this is all at eight kilohertz ; and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . ; Hmm .
Bmr015_678	No , it 's real interesting . ; Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting . ; Uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume , ; Is true .
Bro010_962	But this is this is , uh , I th I think a little more direct . ; How did they measure the performance of their detector ? ; And ; Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , uh , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant .
Bmr006_802	Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . ; Oh ! ; Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? ; Which catege which category ?
Bed004_677	And so that you might want to then have those ; b Th - Then they may have to be separate . ; They may not be able to be values of the same variable . ; Object type ,
Btr001_1676	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , ; Yeah . ; so . And you know , the the segmenter usually misses little things like " mm - hmm " and " yeah "
Bro027_357	you know . ; Right . ; Uh ; But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually ,
Bns001_973	At least , uh , if you we want to use U M ; I 'm I 'm just uh throwing the question . ; uh I mean , looking for an answer ; because I don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this .
Bro027_1084	Yeah , ; that 's the only place that we can train . ; We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_160	Well , I mean it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , ; Yeah . ; so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of ; if this microphone seems OK to people ,
Bmr018_1316	one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels . ; And the sixty - four channel one is for the array , ; but they 've got some empty channels there , ; and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that .
Bdb001_1210	Yep . ; So ; You could definitely do that with the ; There 's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that so you have different formats .
Bro014_316	so they said " how much is significantly better ? ; what do you ? " ; And and so they said " well , you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1368	The on switch is here on the on the top there . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And just clip it to your collar .
Bsr001_1075	I mean , things like rewriting this Transcriber tool ; I mean , just ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_629	and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it . ; But , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , uh , uh , at least you have a starting point that 's
Bro024_1084	Oh , OK . ; So they changed the whole thing so that there 's no delay for that compression and part also . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1275	And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information , ; the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers . ; And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that . ; Yep .
Bmr016_1685	I 'm just pointing that out . ; I i it 's the only ; There 's ; it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it ,
Bro010_787	More or less ? ; I d I ; Y you know , perhaps ? ; No .
Bro014_1443	So we 'll perhaps try to convince OGI people to use the new the new filters ; and ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro017_686	so because it is really it 's a p it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search ; Yeah . ; uh ; but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants .
Btr001_1290	Um , like from start to finish , ; I don't know if I did one . ; so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself . ; Wow .
Bro028_597	if the ; and I they they , um , released like a smaller data set that you can use that only takes like sixteen hours to train and stuff . ; So I can I can run it on that just to make sure that the the thing works and everything . ; Oh ! Good .
Btr001_2475	It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time . ; Yeah . ; It 's hard to figure out what they 're doi what they 're talking about , ; and also they don't tend to talk very f
Bed012_132	Well , w wouldn't we just take the structure that 's outputted and then run another transformation on it , that would just dump the one that we wanted out ? ; Yeah . w We 'd need to prune . ; Right ? ; Throw things away .
Bmr024_559	Yeah . ; But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . ; So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session . ; You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet
Bro003_600	OK . ; Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system . ; You know , you 're really asking this net to learn . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_449	I just think I told them to contact Jane that , uh , if they had a ; Oh , OK . ; That 's right . ; if , uh that that , uh , as the point person on it .
Bro003_447	Mm - hmm . ; Um , and seeing if if it hurts or helps . ; And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ? ; Anyway .
Bro023_1157	Hmm . ; Uh , actually the the smoothing that I did do here reduced the musical noise . ; Well , it ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1383	OK , ; Oh , also that ; so let 's start over . ; So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled ,
Bmr016_483	Yeah . ; something like that ; rather than doing it during a real meeting ; and you know , do two people at a time
Bmr006_1760	i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um the audio , and just put in brackets " speaker - one " . ; Yeah . ; For the public one . ; the ? ?
Bmr030_721	and what percent full it is . ; Cool . ; So . ; And that 's , you know , each time you go there , it 's updated .
Bns003_948	and , um , ; but neverless we have to live with this situation . ; Right . ; You are laughing , again ?
Bro023_1279	Yeah , so this is th the , um ; Well , actually , this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was kind of excited by the result .
Bed016_1034	Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah . ; You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something . ; Yeah . ; But that 's not metaphorical .
Bmr013_16	And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . ; Mmm . ; Filtering for what ? ; For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead .
Bro024_1829	One thing that I note are not here in this result but are speak are spoken before with Sunil I I improve my result using clean LDA filter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; If I use , eh , the LDA filter that are training with the noisy speech , that hurts the res my results .
Bro027_1371	Mm - hmm . ; You know , I 've been wondering about something . ; In the , um a lot of the , um the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . ; and and they , um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models .
Bed002_110	Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine , ; Right . ; OK . ; but we find that
Bed011_89	They give us some information on themselves . ; OK . ; Then then they will read uh a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between . ; And um and they have to read isolated proper names
Bmr006_1499	We could s ; I really do think that , ; Mm - hmm . ; because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself ,
Btr001_583	Mm - hmm . ; but you couldn't really ; Well could you ? ; Did we didn't do that very much .
Bmr024_1189	Cool . ; And ; Yeah , I got confused by the results . ; It sai because uh , the meeting before , you said " OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent " .
Bro023_1446	Yeah . ; And and that 's sort of one of the ; all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee . ; Oh !
Bmr002_933	We 're not very good ; OK . ; but we 're proud of ourselves . ; Right .
Bro014_1502	Uh , ; anything to ; N um , not not not much is new . ; talk about ?
Bmr008_1037	Have the same name . ; Oh . ; Yeah , I 'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in at Boeing . ; I see .
Bro005_425	Right ? ; Uh . ; So ; Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net
Bed003_331	So we looked at the data ; Oh . ; and in a lot of data people were saying things like " Can I get to this place ? " ; " What is the admission fee ? " .
Bro019_313	Um . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and and also uh , Stephane 's a a really good resource for that if you can't find me . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bns003_849	and one aspect is that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the exact information of your links , dates , and so on . ; It what we have plans of that . ; And trying to look at some routing policies , or routing algorithms . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_381	It 's it 's sort of t cognitive , neural , psycho , linguistic , ; but all for the sake of doing computer science . ; So it 's sort of cognitive , psycho , neural , plausibly motivated , architectures of natural language processing . ; So it seems pretty interdisciplinary ,
Bmr009_1220	How ; because if you don't know , then , you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally inept or something , ; Good . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_359	I mean , no . ; and people use it for cell phones ; Yeah , it 's weird . ; Yeah .
Bed011_227	like I I I guess we 're trying to limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , ; right ? ; But who is it that has to care about this , ; or what component of the system ?
Bmr011_889	Ah ! ; Oh . OK . ; I gotcha . ; So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that .
Bmr005_1206	It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards . ; But I but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea . ; OK . ; Well , if there is , anyway .
Bed010_250	OK . ; But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where ; Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , ; what 's the ontology look like ,
Bmr021_725	Well , we used , uh , twelve PLP uh , uh ; So not RASTA , ; just PLP . ; Just PLP .
Bmr005_806	It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume , ; Uh - huh . ; Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand . ; Right ,
Bns002_551	You know the bit rate , ; Mm - hmm . ; so you know that the amount of time you have to wait until you can try to get the control , or t try to send your own transmission . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_780	What are you looking at here ? ; He 's got the Mark - up Framework . ; Oh , yeah . ; Different coding schemes .
Bro027_211	Yeah , ; the semester 's late late August they start here . ; Yikes . ; So they do it right at the beginning of the semester .
Bmr006_1165	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess . ; You have a question . ; Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question ,
Bmr003_1734	Mm - hmm . ; cuz it 's the speakers the same . ; And then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker , uh , con continuation . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_127	And so no reply is no changes . ; And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is " OK " . ; OK . ; So that 's very clear
Bro005_832	Um . ; OK . ; So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , ; yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing .
Bmr002_1004	Sure . ; And I think I got this off the U Penn ; and it does in fact cite a French site , ; so um they have some sort of an arrangement .
Bmr024_573	It 's a lot more believable , too , ; " No ! " ; if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine . ; And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense .
Bmr026_1133	and the other thing uh , ; Oh . ; sorry , ; it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .
Bmr025_387	Yeah . ; visualizing what these features are doing ; Yeah . ; and so either
Bsr001_2510	It 's a different task than read . ; yeah . ; You you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not . ; OK .
Bed005_271	So so , the point is , if it says " this " and " see " , it also will work in " see " and " this " ? ; S ; In the other order ? ; Yeah .
Bro013_659	so you can imagine um five or so parallel um features um transitioning independently ; and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data . ; Hmm . ; So he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in um in this
Bro027_1807	So , like , it 's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech ; Uh , yeah . ; or , I mean , different among classes . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_587	Yeah . ; OK . ; and I said , " well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . " ; Yeah .
Bed016_896	we 've thought about that . ; Right . Right . ; And then ; Nnn .
Btr001_1372	Right . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; There 's also some i iffiness about how d if
Bro012_1404	I see . ; S But we could use uh the the noisy version that TIMIT , ; which you know , is similar to the the noises found in the TI - digits um portion of Aurora . ; Yeah .
Bns003_375	So , ; that 's the point . ; We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago . ; Uh , the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway .
Bmr008_112	and were treated as equals , g and and help helpers , you know , in in research , uh uh c uh roles and things that they that they ; In terms of like the s the social dynamics of interactions , I would expect them to be less deferent . ; Mm - hmm . ; and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that .
Bmr023_501	Yes . ; given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . ; Um . ; It 'll certainly be done by then . Yeah .
Bro027_1641	So we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . ; Yeah . ; Because they did that itself ; Then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and
Bsr001_195	Yeah . ; Ca - can can we fast forward through this conversation ? ; So ; Oh , yeah , that 's right .
Bmr024_1110	He 's saying get a whole different drive . ; Yeah , just give a dedi ; But there 's no reason to do that . ; Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him " can I use your tape robot ? " ,
Btr001_751	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; l you know , like ; With fricatives a lot .
Bed005_789	Something , uh , maybe we should address one of these days , is to That most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements , ; and and analyze those . ; Whether it 's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this . ; Hmm .
Bmr026_814	Yeah . ; That 's the the the ; There 's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end ; You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems
Bmr016_1633	Wh - the self - referential aspect of these these p ; I 'm wai ; Yes , it 's very bad . ; Yeah .
Bro017_128	For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement ; and suddenly you are saying " oh no we we will do something less " , ; but maybe we should discuss that . ; And everybody said " oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there "
Bmr027_1519	Mm - hmm . ; some generic ; Good . ; Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems
Bmr008_622	Or someone could in Geor - in in New York and have , I mean , any number of different types of speech patterns . ; Or their parents live ; yeah . ; Yeah , so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of
Bro027_362	OK . ; But if if , uh if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bsr001_1170	It 's so funny , like we close the door and it 's ; Normally a note taker would know not to do that . ; OK . ; Ha !
Bns001_547	A Ricochet here , right ? ; Ricochet , ; yeah , ; Yeah .
Bro019_259	So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called " no evict " . ; And if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch ,
Bro004_981	transform the PLP ; per ; and only transform the other ; I 'm not sure .
Bmr005_235	But it was uh ; Do Sh - Can I say ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro017_555	Which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is ; Yeah . ; Yes . Yes . ; We we getting we getting there , right .
Bsr001_1517	And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card ; mm - hmm . ; cuz I think we might wanna go with that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1789	Oh ! ; Well , I mean , ; isn't there a category something like uh , " sounds for someone for whom there is no i close mike " ? ; Yeah that would be very important ,
Btr001_2370	You know . ; Yeah . ; And to me that 's more of like the " Maybe this shouldn't be funny ; but it is .
Bmr020_1498	Sure . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1641	Right . ; Just ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr008_202	oh , that 's right , ; you know I was saying " Professor " . ; I mean a Visiting S Researcher or whatever . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_2095	Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored . ; Yep . Or , like , I 'll think ; Right . It 's something you 're not interacting with , ; Oh . No , for me it was unconscious .
Bed009_449	Right . ; whereas in the a um tourist domain it might be an entire route . ; Indeed . ; Set - based , or even very complex structured information in these slots
Btr002_3053	I 'm sorry ! ; Right . ; OK ; That 's OK .
Bro011_740	Thanks . ; Yeah . ; I was going crazy trying to do that . ; Huh .
Buw001_2150	and especially good ; Yeah , OK . ; Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . ; It 's things occur without any
Bro028_150	Oh . ; um , ; The VAD network is ? ; Which is smaller ,
Bmr020_1569	I I did this on on four meetings and only five minutes of of every meet of of these meetings ; so , it 's not not that representative , ; but , ; it 's perhaps ,
Bed002_754	Mm - hmm . ; there was n there was no label , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr002_1024	with like lists and lists and lists of uh various and assorted tools . ; OK . ; Yes . ; Well there 's They have a special project , as I 'm remembering ,
Btr002_561	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; apparently .
Bro014_1281	Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying " OK , our feature set will be the FFT " , ; cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother , ; Mm - hmm . ; but maybe there 's something that we missed .
Bmr010_1261	because , uh , I have the results , eh , of the study of different energy without the law length . ; Eh , um , eh , ; in the in the measurement , uh , the average , uh , dividing by the by the , um , variance . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_982	They also all have h heavy accents . ; The networks group meetings are all ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1926	Yeah . ; But what I want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for . ; even suggest some solutions . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1322	So you know . ; Hmm . ; Or or any good old Pink Floyd concert . ; I see .
Bro005_580	But ; Is it i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , ; so I d Is it ; That 's uh , exactly the point , I think ,
Bro003_1315	it 's not actually broader class , ; it 's actually finer class , ; but you mean y You mean more classes . ; Right .
Bmr015_477	there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things . ; Right . ; Yep . ; I see .
Bed011_962	Dialogues . SmartKom ; OK . ; SmartKom Human . ; Wizard of Oz .
Bed008_1462	Like how thrifty the user is , ; or do we have access to that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh right .
Bed015_966	So ; OK , that was one comment . ; And you had another one ? ; Yeah , well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background .
Bmr012_1306	And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one ; that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes ; but to be basically in three parts , ; the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects
Bro014_1471	and he 's been doing all the talking ; but but these he 's he 's , uh ; Yeah . ; This is this by the way a bad thing .
Bro008_65	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , um ; So , we 'll we 'll hold off on that a little bit .
Bro005_163	Um . for the ne rest of experiment I use multi - English , ; only multi - English . ; And I try to combine different type of feature , ; but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database
Bmr009_974	Yeah . ; You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great if you 're a linguist " . ; Yeah . ; Actually even if you t
Bro024_394	They they , uh , they have some , um , ; uh , ; in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic . ; And so , uh , if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be , then you you can do it there .
Buw001_1540	w Just " what would you like to know ? " ; Yeah . ; But that neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is . ; Yes .
Bmr027_948	Uh . Let 's see . ; We ; Yeah , right . ; So we got the transcript back from that one meeting .
Bmr029_602	the the test data for the far far microphone . ; If if it turns out that for some reason it 's easier for him to use the old um , the the the old , ; uh , ; Segmentation ?
Bmr010_261	Um , I talked with , uh , Munich guys from from Ludwi - Ludwig Maximilians University , who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they basically said they have they have , uh , a tool they developed themselves ; and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone ,
Bsr001_1839	OK . ; and they don't ; it 's hard for them to give us money ; but they they seem to be willing to give us time .
Bed005_655	yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ? ; Uh , this and this , of course , was just the action end . ; OK . ; Uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .
Bmr028_1247	Oh . ; In case you care . ; Well . But then there 's other changes . ; So . I mean , there 's other
Bmr030_254	Oh , that 's great . ; Audio . ; Yeah . ; And the stylized F - naught features are pretty cool .
Bmr001_235	Do they mean omnidirectional , ; is that their point ? ; I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions . ; I think uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's if it 's near field , the mathematics of beam beam steering is different .
Bed008_898	The time of day , ; right ; I well , right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2060	So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually ? ; Like you can't use gesture ? ; Yeah . ; Exactly .
Bro018_334	but not only to read the proposal . ; Look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and ; I begin to to work also in that . ; But the first thing that I don't understand is that they are using R - the uh log energy that this quite
Bmr005_857	and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first , ; cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first . ; Yep . ; But uh , having having somebody have some experience , again , with with uh with marking it from a human standpoint ,
Btr002_2139	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate . ; Yeah !
Bmr022_253	Yep . ; I mean , Chuck 's suggestion of just two beeps is nice ; Yeah , maybe . ; because then you could have them actually transcribe " H - beep " or " L - beep " ,
Bed015_1421	just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level . ; If you stressed , you know , " John went to the " , you know , " the bar " whatever , you 're focusing that ; Mm - hmm . ; and a in a possible inference is " in contrast to other things " .
Bro010_77	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , ; Yeah .
Bmr021_807	Hmm . ; and then , when I combined them ; I can actually combine them with something like ROVER . ; It 's actually more sophisticated than ROVER
Bmr031_219	and you can play with it . ; Cool . ; Um . ; Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation w on the test set .
Bmr027_510	you know , just give it to me ; and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , ; Right . ; and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you
Bsr001_1437	Yeah , ; I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them . ; You know , with a with a telephone . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_718	I I understand , ; and then I want to ; but is is it summing signals ; or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ?
Bmr006_1410	Yeah . ; That is cool . ; Yeah . ; It was yeah , it was interesting .
Bns003_615	Yeah . ; Uh , do you know whether they have ; There 's a lot of , uh , z budget cuts going on ; and nothing is possible anymore ,
Bmr029_282	That was both types of meetings , ; but most but there were only two Robustness meetings , and four or five , uh , Meeting Recorders . ; And if we 're re - doing the baseline anyways , it it it would be OK . ; Right .
Bmr003_2600	But anyway you 'd save , on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system . ; So actually that might be attractive . ; Right . ; OK ,
Bro024_1284	Yeah , the Yeah , it 's true . ; So , yeah , ; we were looking at this . ; But for most of the noises , noises are
Bro004_332	Uh . ; Yeah . ; So . This was for the PLP , ; Yeah .
Bed005_1004	Y ; or ; Sorry . ; E - EVA
Bmr006_1577	Yeah , and and you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . ; Mm - hmm . ; S i You know , " You raised the point , So - and - so " , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who " you " was . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_876	yeah , nobody will remember how to repair a Jimbox or a Jimlet or a ; Really ? ; I think there 's a problem with this one . ; Yep .
Bmr006_458	It 's a novelty item . ; Right . ; We 're saying , " Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . ; Is - is isn't that neat .
Bro019_304	I I can I 'm not sure about that one . ; yeah . ; But uh . ; OK .
Bmr019_1912	Right . ; OK . ; Oops . ; I have to what ?
Bmr030_187	Yeah , either one will work , I think . ; eh , ; but ; It was faster than my PC .
Bro022_936	But I mean , that 's that 's been a useful thing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_702	if there 's any important issue that that ; And , um ; I mean if if you want to uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great . ; OK .
Bdb001_80	right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; " T equals one point three two " ,
Bro023_185	OK . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you really need a lot of speech to estimate the mean of it .
Bmr006_640	Yeah . ; And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .
Bmr021_677	Yeah , it 's the Channeltrans , ; Yeah . ; so the the things that Dave Gelbart ; Yeah , excellent .
Bed015_1964	Ooo , can I ask a ; You ran out of power . ; Huh ? ; Can I ask a quick question about this side ?
Buw001_877	in which case , that 's a useful thing to have ; Uh , I mean , we uh , we don't need to require it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Just like the
Bmr008_1655	yeah . ; I mean , be i And if they still overlapped , i i the ; That 's hard . ; But but I I think that this is a good first thing , to just sort of see .
Bmr009_527	and I agree with you it 's better to I suppose it 's better to to consider the the energy this kind of parameter bef ; Yeah . ; Oh , that 's not what I meant . ; No , no .
Bmr005_999	i if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , ; not not not eighty or ninety . ; But . ; So there 's probably there 's three to four a week ,
Bed006_99	Officially , ; yeah . ; Officially , ; but in reality already um much much longer
Bro007_478	Maybe the Thursday the twelfth of the night of the Thurs - thirty - one is is not valid in Europe . ; Yeah . ; We don't know is happening . ; Yes , so I mean I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday
Bmr028_1384	Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties , ; and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets . ; It was really hot . ; Everybody thought it would do everything .
Bsr001_2087	if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be maybe we 'll end up doing that . ; So . ; Well ; And UW is also probably gonna be interested in that too ,
Bed005_191	So it it ; Isn't it ? ; No . ; No .
Bmr005_1314	It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data . ; Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue , ; but there 's there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer . ; Yep .
Bed016_529	So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , ; unless you put it in the text ,
Bed014_932	Yeah , I can understand that . ; Well p ; people people differ in their tastes in this matter . ; Yeah .
Bns003_43	in principle , in his spare time . ; Yeah ! ; Yeah . ; Uh I will
Bro021_1317	So it 's ; Yeah . So it 's actually forty numbers that you 're getting . ; Yeah , maybe maybe you don't have a ; Uh , the original paper say that only one Gaussian for the noise .
Bmr024_943	That 's what I ; On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . ; But , uh I I you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . ; Mmm .
Bmr029_174	W s so is Morgan , is the plan to just pick one of the far - field mikes ? ; Yeah . Yeah . We did . ; Uh ; And there 's a bit of a question whether you want to use um , what segmentations you want to use .
Bmr008_198	like I don't know what I would be here , ; just I 'm not a professor ; I 'm not a ; So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y
Bed016_430	It 's on biocomputation . Would ; Yeah , it 's different , ; this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_614	And then each utterance could refer to a turn , ; and each turn could refer to something higher up . ; And what if you actually have ; So right now what you have as utterance , um , the closest thing that comes out of the channelized is the stuff between the segment boundaries that the transcribers put in or that Thilo put in ,
Bed005_124	but it was about an hour and ten minutes . ; Yep . ; Something like that . ; And , um and now it 's We have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does .
Bmr026_1175	Hello ? ; I I think so . ; I 'll ; Excuse me ?
Bmr020_1230	r yeah ? ; Yeah . ; And then um , the transcriber , instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything . ; OK ?
Bdb001_690	And let 's say that they don't nest . ; So , you know , a prosodic phrase may cross two sentences or something . ; Right . ; I don't know if that 's true or not
Bmr007_402	So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's We know that that 's wrong in real time . ; Yeah ? ; But , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it , ; but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way .
Bro010_657	Mmm . ; right ? ; So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_422	And they 'll say there 's no such thing . ; So . ; I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird ; Right .
Bro008_316	Mm - hmm . ; And so , um ; Yeah , so perhaps we could have a a large gain , eh , just by looking at improving the , uh , recognition , not of phonemes , but of phoneme classes , simply . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_102	where maybe we don't want to use the other the enemy network infrastructure , for evident reasons . ; Yeah . ; Hmm ? ; But you can also , I believe , uh to have an ad - hoc network , where one node is then connecting to the outer world .
Buw001_1402	I will say that that I I chose " interesting " ; because I think it includes also " important " ; in some cases . ; But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information .
Bmr028_106	Yeah . Tried that , and it died . ; And it displays it at ; Yeah . Did it ? ; And it allows you to show m many different resolutions .
Bro014_335	But there is this this is this still this problem of weights . ; When when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases , ; Oh , yeah ? ; and some people think that
Bed006_903	Mm - hmm . ; So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things ; Yeah . ; and I di don't know if that 's something we need to invent
Bro010_495	Or or less , ; Yeah . ; or ; Really ?
Bmr003_1862	I I 'd like to be able to to pore through , you know , the the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web . ; OK ,
Bmr027_643	Right . That would that would definitely work on me . ; Yeah . ; It is the first time through the cycle . ; You know , it makes you feel m like ,
Bmr031_1108	And and th that 's actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , you know , you have , say , a tag for ; I don't know
Bmr007_940	Mm - hmm . ; This this is the idea . ; And if , if you do that , eh eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh of distance in a first step , and then you , eh you get the , eh the hypothesis to the this change acoustic , eh to po process ; Right .
Bro017_1080	Ugh ! ; And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village ; and ; Yeah .
Bro005_872	uh ; Aha . ; I see . ; French French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually
Bmr005_91	and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? " ; And and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to " . ; Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? ; So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret " ahead of the game " ?
Bmr021_366	uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them , ; Shortening everything on the fly . ; so I while this other thing was still going on , I was run I was running this this thing . ; You had another process running that was shortening it .
Btr001_901	So just do a you know , a mark , then " fascinating " , and then put " PRN " and uh " interrupted by a pause " or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know . ; Mm - hmm , ; mm - hmm . ; PRN .
Bro017_440	So I I said " well , yeah , OK " so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out . ; So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first . ; Hmm . ; Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier .
Bed004_637	cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it expand it out into more layers basically ? ; Right . ; We might . ; Uh , I mean that that 's certainly one thing we can do .
Btr002_532	Hmm . ; And so that 's why they use male voices . ; We were just talking about that . ; They should do that at BART , too ,
Bmr008_553	Although for different ; Well , that 's true . ; You 'd just leave them . ; I mean , Indian English I wouldn't know f
Bed003_466	Oh , ; sorry . ; " Verb used " is like , ; right now we only have three values ,
Bmr010_155	And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , ; I did that for for five minutes of one dialogue ; or did you just ? ; Right .
Bro012_1104	the compared to the small or the big network . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD .
Bmr016_951	but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out ; cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . ; You c you can actually move them around . ; And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions
Bed015_920	" John is on the bus " . ; " it 's the bu " so e ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Right .
Bed016_571	So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal
Bsr001_1789	Not quite ; but ; You can have my mike . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr016_1985	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 've added that all now too . ; Good .
Buw001_933	Yeah . But not not to rely on them for basic modeling . ; That 's true . ; So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . ; Yeah , I 'm not sure .
Bed006_118	Wizard . ; wizard ; OK . ; uh by by popular vote
Bmr009_1586	Yeah . ; They may well have not had much demand for it . ; And if if ; Well that 's that 's that 's true , too .
Bed003_1310	and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars , ; and then the persons says um " Yeah I want to see it . " ; Yeah ? ; meaning " It 's way out of my budget "
Bed015_868	Mm - hmm . ; and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you 're left with a couple three .
Bro021_1186	This is one . ; Eh , this is the composition of the dictionary . ; Mm - hmm . ; This one thing .
Bro016_789	Cuz if you 're taking the log of these things , it could be , ; uh ; Knowing what the sum of the probabilities are , doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1091	Without putting in a second path . ; Uh . You mean ; Oh , yeah ! ; Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ?
Bro017_1106	That wouldn't be too difficult to try . ; Maybe I could set that up . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_440	OK . ; But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do . ; But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr024_307	And , uh , the audio quality is so good ; So they can they can , um , scroll through that pretty quick ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1081	That right now , lots of people create the files ; and then we have group " Meeting Recorder " . ; But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder group can overwrite the files . ; And so that 's a pretty coarse level of granularity .
Bns002_126	Nothing prevents , ; except well maybe the cost , to send not only one mobile rover , but ten tons of them , or or at least uh several of them . ; So , uh ; higher area could be covered , could be explored
Bed015_1905	So , uh ; OK . ; So a and we get this this , uh , portals fixed ; and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range .
Bmr019_1716	It 's off . ; I will come back to home to Spain . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bmr008_272	So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler ; even though I know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who 's doing research in in this area ; I uh The the the thing making me lean toward simpler where possible is that uh the more a thing ; Many of the meetings that we record uh , may be the kind where we just record somebody once
Btr001_245	I can do I can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them ; Yeah . ; because of singing . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1369	Yeah . ; But if you included , uh , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_281	So , um ; At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . ; And , that sort of , um , is useful , ; and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up .
Bmr005_1301	I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , ; but I think if it 's a real ; Why not ? ; Yeah .
Bmr023_351	because if the IBM thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we wouldn't wanna have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . ; So . ; And this way it 'll I mean , I got really a lot of response for for my notice ; and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to .
Bed011_585	Just to be totally clear . ; OK . ; Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel , ; so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think .
Bed009_394	OK . ; " First go here , ; first go there ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_642	The complete SRI system is one point two . ; You you were HTK . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Bmr016_1365	No , we just gave her a list of words that , you know , weren't in our dictionary ; Cuz I haven't heard it . ; and so of course it picked up stuff like this , ; and she just didn't listen
Bmr006_1637	Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? ; Yu - Ching ? ; y Yu - Ching . ; was that um , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down .
Bro018_599	Right ? So so it I mean I I guess it 's ; Sort of an equivalent . ; You know , it it goes back to nearest - neighbor sort of thing , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1025	um ; Uh , now I lost track of what I was thinking . ; But . ; What is the
Bed006_943	Mm - hmm . ; and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed017_654	And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , ; Who ? ; I can take you to his office . ; It 's just around the corner .
Bed005_1416	you know . ; But , yeah , we could look at it . ; Well , I was j ; OK . Yeah .
Bsr001_483	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; There 's just no other way around it . ; Somebody will design a comfortable close talking mike .
Bed013_622	Oh , you have a link . OK . OK . ; I got an email . ; OK . ; By the way , Keith is comfortable with us calling him " cool Keith " .
Bmr027_310	Right . ; Oh . ; Here . ; You can read what you already signed .
Bmr010_1452	Yeah . ; Um . ; The other thing one could do is Couldn't ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1824	Mmm . ; you know , the sighing ; and the , " Oh no ! " ; You know , it 's it 's , uh , i There are lot 's of nuances which we uh , which we use very often .
Bmr010_334	then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . ; Yeah . ; uh Th - they 're making really quick progress . ; That 's great .
Bmr020_1281	Well there 's the question o of whether ; Well , OK . ; She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_653	I haven't split it up that way , ; but it would be ; But there 's no overlap during the digit readings , so it shouldn't really matter . ; Right .
Bro027_599	There is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the LDA . ; Um , so the delta at the end is how much ? ; It 's fifty . ; It 's
Bmr008_1098	Just to pick up an arbitrary an example . ; So - and - so and so ; We this wouldn't be relevant all the time ; but you know , if there 's a big discussion on you know , the the um , best way to move house , then and these people are talking a whole lot , then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they 're married , or
Btr002_1850	Oh yeah . ; Yes . Oh , yes . ; And he got to transcribe this meeting . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_3217	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And I have like , uh , uh , two more things I wanted to say . ; One of them is , um
Bmr028_1554	Right . Eh or w But we really can't work on that problem . ; Yep . ; We don't have time , ; we 're not interested , or w whatever
Btr002_1537	Oh , yes . ; I don't know . ; Because the , uh the waveform becomes too stretched out . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1792	so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_245	Here 's a k ; Oh ! ; Oh , I 'll wait until you 're plugged in . ; Oh , don't sit there .
Bmr025_948	right ? ; That 's why we have this little ; I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone ; but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it
Bro026_1010	In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do ; because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_369	This a lot of this stuff is not networking group NSA , uh , restricted . ; No , ; I know . ; Yeah , but nobody do that , you know .
Bns001_1756	but I think we sh we will miss the cake ; OK , sorry , sorry . ; RSVP . ; and I think we should stop now but please everybody ,
Bmr009_1522	Yeah . ; He also has version control which is another nice ; e so you e the patches that you ; No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed .
Bed002_1078	Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount . ; Mmm . ; OK . ; I have no idea whether that 's
Bro028_836	And then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something , ; Hmm . ; so if it gets too low you don't don't do it . ; Hmm .
Bed008_25	and so to do that ; so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things ; Is your mike on ? ; Ah .
Bed015_683	Right . ; Right , right . Yeah , um , definitely . ; So , um , ; " in " was a good example .
Bns003_855	because in principle , the forwarding pass is a little bit decoupled from this from the routing pass , ; Yeah . ; and this was , in principle ; OK ,
Btr001_2533	and ; and he 's he 's doing this one of these mock fights with Nancy , ; which he does . ; Have you run across these mock fights ?
Bed016_620	Yep . ; You con you conditioned me with your first sentence , ; and so I thought , " Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? " ; He slipped on the wet floor .
Bro013_213	uh has has a lot of nice points to it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even .
Bro018_200	How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ? ; Oh , not too much . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , one day or less .
Bed005_371	Nope . ; No , that 's not it . ; Yeah . ; This is sort of what happens .
Bmr011_554	Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . ; Yeah . ; Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . ; Hmm .
Bdb001_625	I mean , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit , ; even though it never actually ; i It 's only a unit by virtue of the annotations at the word - level . ; Sure .
Bsr001_350	You 're a very soft whistler , ; you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , ; Actually , I use something like this on on the telephone and it 's very comfortable . ; Yeah .
Bro024_514	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and in that twenty percent @ @ it 's very inconsistent across different noise conditions . ; Mmm .
Btr002_3004	I 'm sorry about that . ; They do this sound , ; and then there 's a pause , ; and then they start speaking ,
Bmr016_1549	and then get rid of the parentheses . ; But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain . ; Yeah , P - make is ; Yeah I mean cuz they they have no idea ,
Bed005_280	" Action watch " , ; Hmm . ; whatever . ; Nothing was specialfi specified .
Bmr016_2211	total of about an thirty minutes . ; That 's that 's been the case . ; So , ; And plus the training , whatever you have .
Bmr024_889	Yep . ; Absolutely . ; Or from being read and read ? ; No .
Bmr015_603	and then piece them together later . ; And I I have a script , ; I can piece them together . ; I mean , so it 's like , I I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation
Bed016_249	Halfway done ? ; Yeah . ; That 's done . ; Mmm .
Bmr026_408	So but that But ; Which one was that , X G ? ; X G ? ; XG .
Bmr024_90	So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about ; Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting . ; We have a little more to discuss . ; Yeah .
Bro012_150	Or I could just add them up and get a different total . ; Yeah . ; It 's not the square . ; OK .
Bmr021_89	I mean , there 's no problem with that . ; It 's just what Should we get just more Sony ones ? ; I hate the Sony ones . ; Which ones are those ?
Bns002_1249	You know , sh oh short short distance cables , ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1346	Uh , ; But did you use channel did you align channel one also ? ; Or ; I just took their entire Italian training part .
Bmr031_1449	Now we have things like " amuse " . ; Like , " oh , you finally got it " . ; And um , and " disappointed - tired " . Like , " yeah , no , that 's wrong again " . ; Which isn't really mad ,
Bmr020_1097	I mentioned before , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , ; and I sent I sent email ,
Bed006_426	all the different actions , if at all possible , ; Right . ; and also people will get caught up in the pictures . ; So all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .
Bed003_863	which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah . ; Hmm . ; Does it have nice walls ? ; It has wonderful walls .
Bmr019_710	things like words that do occur just by themselves a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it ; Yeah . ; those would be able to do that , ; Sorry .
Bro023_533	But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one , ; so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the VAD . ; I mean , that 's like a cheating method . ; Right .
Bmr012_483	Like Trent Lott must have been from ; uh because ; I guess Switchboard was before ; mm - hmm ,
Bmr016_1889	Right . ; and it also gets kicked out in the , uh , freq frequency listing . ; Right . ; I have the there 're various things like " breathe " versus " breath " versus " inhale " and , hhh ,
Bmr014_280	So all the all the forms are now on the computer . ; And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh transcribers use different tools . ; And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_803	Well , for example , if we include that , ; Yeah . ; yeah ? ; um , accessibility or something ,
Bmr008_706	Well , the way it 's phrased right now , it 's clearly asking about language . ; Yeah . ; And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak . ; Now , I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak .
Bro003_1764	Yes . ; and , uh , joining the data ; and Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed014_106	So the trees for ; the XML trees for the for the gene for the synthesizer are written . ; So I just need to do the , uh write a new set of tree combining rules . ; But I think those 'll be pretty similar to the old ones .
Bmr031_1335	we we gotta be convinced we understand what 's going on . ; But it 's starting to look like it it 's almost the opposite of the usual th situation where , um , you get some really nice result with , uh with digits , say , ; and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away . ; Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away .
Bmr021_358	OK . ; because I actually was running On a different experiment , ; I had segmented I was processing the whole Switchboard - two corpus , ; which is two hundred eighty hours of speech ,
Bed009_555	And even on on a more basic level the the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures . ; Hmm ? ; And not just um say um um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states and th these states really are fixed in in a certain sense . ; Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner " ?
Bmr016_443	OK . ; Go . ; I 'm sorry . ; I 'm mean I think it 's doable ,
Bmr009_1436	Yeah . ; You could say Liverpool . ; Liverpuddlian . ; Yeah .
Bro010_725	is it very useful ; Very slow adaptation . ; and is the c ; Right ,
Bmr011_313	In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , um , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . ; Do you I know that you 're al also supplementing it further . ; Do you want to mention something about that c Thilo , ; or ?
Bdb001_867	I I 'm still , um , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation . ; e ; Because the text representation is gonna be , uh , not reflecting the structure of of your words and annotations . ; It 's just it 's
Bmr027_179	Yeah . It 's the other group . ; I It was the network network services group . ; OK . ; Uh - huh .
Bro021_440	Yeah . ; so that 's why we stuck to thirteen . ; Yeah . ; And there is there is also this log energy versus C - zero .
Btr002_3075	You sh ; Yeah ; she could make it out probably . ; OK . Right .
Bro010_640	Yeah , ; that 's hard to do . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_754	Go ahead . ; And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . ; I should 've got the digital camera . ; Oh well .
Bed016_891	Around ? ; No , it 's the bakery itself ; is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? ; Oh .
Bmr012_1011	So ; I mean one thing is it the whole thing as I said is is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling ; so that pushes requirements up a bit ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1122	It 's i it would be too taxing . ; But , um , they 're putting in a lot of ; Yeah . ; And and I checked them over .
Bmr008_927	So . ; Right . ; So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , Region , and Variety of English . ; And that 's it .
Bro021_1239	I can calculate I can I calculated this value , uh , with the statistic of the noisy speech that I calculated before with the VTS approximation . ; Mm - hmm . ; And well , normalizing . ; And I know everything .
Bmr009_553	and I had plan to go through with it , of of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s just with reference to speaker style so , you know , with reference ; Oh . ; That 'd be great . ; and you know I said that on my in my summary ,
Btr002_1951	Oh n ; And they 're all like in they 're own r world or something ; because Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine . ; And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s still in the room
Bed012_447	right ? ; The uh ; Uh , no . So if if for example , the Go - there posterior possibility is so high , um , ; uh , w if it 's if it has reached reached a certain height , then all of this becomes irrelevant .
Bed009_609	but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion . ; Or to enter his discussion , actually . ; That 's the way around . ; Yeah , Marcus .
Bed015_471	I think that 's exactly right . ; So so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it ; you know , having it both ways , right ? ; Yeah .
Bed015_1367	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , there there are other things . ; Causal stuff we absolutely need . ; Mental space we need .
Bed016_713	because to some extent they 're synonyms . ; OK . ; I had two hours w with George on this , ; OK , what did he say .
Bed009_179	and so it 's a sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information ; Mm - hmm . ; tells you how to get places . ; And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on .
Buw001_1992	OK . ; cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over
Bro026_723	Anybody have anything else ? ; Uh , one one last question on that . ; When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? ; Um , I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there .
Bmr003_1505	That 's another issue . ; I mean , Jane had had comments like uh , to who who the person was speaking to . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1452	I think I won't touch anything ; cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash ; which it seems to do , pretty easily . ; OK , thanks .
Bro010_1279	is there ? ; Oh , no ? ; Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , ; or ?
Bro011_219	Yeah . ; and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't ; When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process ; or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ?
Bro028_1079	but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth . ; And , um , um , um ; And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , ; in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings
Bed011_681	OK , " endpoint " . ; " Tourist needs food , badly " ; Right . ; " Endpoint " is pretty clear .
Bsr001_1737	Tens of hours . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours .
Bmr014_1166	You know , but . ; Liz will like it . ; We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . ; Yep , yep , that 's right .
Bmr011_305	Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great . ; He he has a prototype . ; I I , uh , @ @ didn't didn't see it , uh , yesterday ; but I 'm going to see it today .
Bro023_1199	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better . ; Mm - hmm . ; But not much on the in the other cases .
Bro005_698	I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the ; OK . ; Um . ; Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already .
Btr002_1195	Oh . ; yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bed006_1308	Get get rid of the sort of SPG slash something ; Right . ; uh or the sub - actions category , ; because what does that tell us ?
Bmr009_967	Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want . ; For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one . ; So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want . ; Because is different , the Span - uh the Spanish language from the the north of Spain , of the south , of the west and the
Bro019_560	the cepstral f The difference is like There may be a slight difference in the way ; because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . ; Right . ; I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that that could be the only difference .
Bro018_305	resource management , ; Wall Street Journal , ; something . ; Some some read task actually , that they 're preparing .
Bdb001_1175	Right . ; So , ; um , ; the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated .
Bmr023_1008	but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , ; Mm - hmm . ; and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel . ; Um , so I think I think that 's the real power of it .
Bmr019_1003	Yeah . ; but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you 're somehow involved in the topic , ; No , that 's really interesting . ; and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question .
Bmr022_8	Definitely have to go to tea . ; So ; Yeah , they 're they 're having birthday cake and such ; That too ,
Bro012_517	So . ; I 'm really confused about something . ; If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1315	Yeah . ; Is that all OK ? ; And that one outcome , that 's ; What ?
Bmr008_1363	I don't normalicized eh in these er experiments . by the moment . ; I don't normalicize . ; OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help . ; Yeah ?
Bro012_28	right ? ; For the P D ; Right . ; But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him
Bed015_290	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I 'm sorry , ; Yeah . ; you 're right .
Bro027_723	Where where is this where is this fifty - seven point O two in in comparison to the last evaluation ? ; Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got . ; Yeah . ; Oh , is that right ?
Bro023_1120	One in the time domain ; I mean , I 'm I 'm @ @ . ; and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , um , coefficients of the impulse response . ; But .
Bmr003_1552	I see . ; So th ; So . ; And that 's w that 's where I added comments .
Bmr006_670	OK . ; I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . ; OK . ; Thank you for your information because I I read . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project .
Bmr012_505	and uh and that 's interesting ; cuz I think the their language models are quite different ; so ; and I I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .
Bed008_597	what was that ; people with Harry drove the car into the cafe ; Never mind . ; Uh anyway , this is crude .
Bro005_525	It 's again better . ; So it 's eighty - nine point point one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ,
Buw001_1586	Um , ; or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed ; and then we will hav ; Yeah . Then we 'll know .
Bed006_408	which is never possible in a in a s in a lab situation , ; Well , u u the one experiment th that that that I 've read somewhere , it was they u used pictures . ; nuh ? ; Yep .
Bro011_265	Right . ; Well or I 'm hoping I 'm hoping Espen will do it . ; Um ; Ah !
Bmr003_1990	OK , ; well , ; send me links ; and I wi
Bro011_540	Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . ; Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target uh uh embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times ; uh f the forward um do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_1158	and so it isn't i i i it wouldn't quite apply here . ; So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those . ; Do y ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_35	Right . ; Did anybody mention about whether the the SRI system is a is is doing the digits um the wor as a word model or as uh a sub s sub - phone states ? ; I guess it 's it 's uh allophone models , ; Yeah .
Bro014_804	OK . ; There was a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something . ; Is that ? ; Yeah .
Bmr003_944	And the other thing too is with with speaker identification , ; if if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal . ; Well it w ; Well , use it .
Bmr018_100	That 's when they 're coming . ; That 's correct . ; So , are we do we have like an agenda or anything that we should be ; No , but that would be a good idea .
Bro025_399	So this ; Which could be a kind of a funny delta . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_1004	but it could be in the also the big neural network that does phoneme classification . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; But each one of the mixture components
Bmr020_1103	And I sent the path . ; maybe using those as references ; because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters . ; And to get an object You need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech .
Bmr027_1387	We should probably talk off - line about when we 're gonna talk off - line . ; OK . OK . ; OK . ; Yeah , I might want to get updated about it in about a week
Bed002_1291	So that it doesn't take you to the wall every time . ; Oh , really ? ; So . Um ; So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered ,
Bmr005_1250	and um and maybe we have this other source . ; But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . ; I mean , that was sort of our goal . ; The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .
Bmr003_1021	Or of action ? ; Thirty ; So , yeah . ; For thirty dollars an hour for of their work .
Bro003_424	The ; Yeah . ; Your turn . ; Oh , my turn .
Btr001_1767	it 's it 's not a very committed laugh , ; I don't know how you do it , ; Right . ; Right .
Bed015_40	Enough to go around ? ; OK . ; And in some ways it 's it 's it 's very similar to ; There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before
Bns001_1528	or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind , ; uh companies like KPN . ; So ; And if we have other suggestions and eh have this as a long term
Bro005_112	What we see is that these nets are not as good , ; except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . ; Yeah , ; then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from uh English digits , and from Italian digits .
Bmr008_365	How about " optional but highly desirable " ? ; Please , please ! ; Yeah . ; Age or Approximate Age .
Bmr018_680	I see . ; so . ; I see . ; Yeah , cuz some of our non - natives are pretty non - native .
Bdb001_272	Y yeah . ; So I think it it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing . ; OK . ; But I think , a anything at frame - level , even P - file , is too verbose .
Bns002_764	Yeah but , i let 's say you have one kilobyte . ; OK ? ; One kilobyte is uh eight uh bits . ; OK ?
Bro028_1163	Um , so , uh , the big picture is k um , come up with a set of , uh , intermediate categories , ; then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition , ; and , um , improve speech recognition in that way . ; Um , so right now I 'm in in the phase where I 'm looking at at , um , deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories .
Bro003_923	the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish , ; Uh , yeah . ; right ? ; Right .
Bro027_1450	Uh - huh . ; and putting those in together . ; And that that seem ; So it 's kind of like a combination of the uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something .
Bmr007_994	to make marking easier . ; Or ; Yeah . ; and I haven't spent a lot of time on it and I 'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it .
Bmr020_353	Yeah . ; You 're getting a lot of breath . ; That 's ; I j was just wondering .
Bmr010_542	And , um ; Look like , uh , you t you explaining in the blackboard ? ; The ? ; Yes , exactly .
Bro010_1035	Um , ; When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w ; Yeah . ; Oh ! OK .
Bro027_719	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; It 's pretty good . ; It 's it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something .
Bmr014_600	The basic thing is this HMM base . ; So there 's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time . ; You know what I mean ? ; There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels
Bro003_1828	with the @ @ three languages , ; Maybe for the other language ; because TIMIT have more phone . ; Yeah .
Bed017_550	and they 're they 're busily working away . ; But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it . ; And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed002_109	Well , we can make up aliases for each of us . ; Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine , ; Right . ; OK .
Btr002_444	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; cuz ; Yeah .
Bro018_765	Just it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection of phonological features . ; Uh - huh . ; I see . ; Yeah ,
Bmr003_1628	Huh - uh . ; I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . ; We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker . ; Yeah ,
Buw001_960	I mean , it would ; Yeah . ; That w shouldn't be hard for ; Yeah .
Bed011_160	That was the uh the data collection in a nutshell . ; And um I can report a so I did this but I also tried to do this ; so if I click on here , ; Isn't this wonderful ?
Bmr024_1523	because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different . ; Right . ; But , it 's it 's that 's probably not it . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1303	Yeah . ; Um , I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_847	Well it 's a merging problem . ; I mean , ; yeah it 's ; If you had a if you had a s if you had a script which would
Btr002_2784	So . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Interesting .
Bmr027_1041	Um , next one . ; Um . This was an interesting one . ; So the original was " So that 's not so Claudia 's not the bad master here " , ; and then he laughs ,
Bmr012_458	so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from ; it 's it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount ; Right . ; but we won't know
Bmr023_623	because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them . ; Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns ; and we 're hoping that maybe with , I don't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . ; But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers ,
Bmr019_988	The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal , ; which , you know , I mean , you c not not too surprising . ; Right . ; But the other thing that
Bmr002_981	c ; Someone mentioned it to me . ; And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me , ; because they thought I would be excited because it 's TCL - based .
Bmr015_37	Do we have an agenda ? ; Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't uh , can't come . ; I do . ; So , they won't be here .
Bed010_1133	Yeah , right . ; It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all , ; Bhaskara . ; right .
Bmr010_751	I ; And so , you know , I 've I 've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing , ; and the bar going up and down , ; and I 'm thinking , I could say something ,
Bmr003_507	Yeah , that I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area , ; and ; OK . ; So this is a very good corpus .
Bro019_594	when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . ; Um , ; but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr013_172	Alright . ; Hmm . ; But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , ; Right .
Bro021_698	and it it was OK . ; So , I plugged it in somewhere ; and then I mean , it 's like I had to remove some part ; and then plugging it in somewhere .
Bns001_574	It would be important for us to to highlight the differences . ; Yeah . ; Because if not , well , they can say , " Oh , you are doing the same thing . " ; " This was done now . "
Bmr021_700	Uh ; Oh , well , yeah I I I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it , ; because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings , ; Hmm .
Bed003_378	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; But we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down .
Bmr021_995	uh eh . Fff . ; What would you like it to do when that happens ? ; Well , no , if if you um ; I mean obviously you always
Bro013_95	Mm - hmm . ; but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Buw001_601	How many people are those meetings ? ; There are more . ; I mean , there are ten - ish . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_669	So ; the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose . ; Right . ; You have to have another type then , I guess .
Bmr022_1366	u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting . ; You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said . ; So there it 's not just a right and wrong thing . ; Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person ,
Btr001_1766	but like ; it 's it 's not a very committed laugh , ; I don't know how you do it , ; Right .
Bro025_51	uh , ; the , uh , one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish , ; uh , but it is , uh , worse on the , uh , Aurora ; It 's worse on
Bro018_631	So . ; But I don't know if people have done sort of careful comparisons of this on large tasks or anything . ; Maybe maybe they have . ; I don't know .
Bmr013_784	Yeah . ; OK , so if I , ; OK , included include , ; OK , then , uh , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour
Btr002_1341	Yeah , the interface was different . ; I I yeah , ; it was it was more complicated . ; That 's a down side .
Bed003_1287	One thing that 's kind of been bugging me when I more I look at this is that the ; I guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it makes it cleaner , but then uh I mean .
Bmr010_1018	cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what what you mean . ; You 'll self - repair . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns001_798	It 's almost perfect . ; They s kind of skipped uh layer five , uh session management or session layer , I think . ; That 's um normally with if you do a socket programming , it 's directly the prot application protocol on layer four , uh TCP socket , or layer five for UDP socket . ; There might also be some research
Bmr009_152	Yeah . Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Yes , absolutely . ; if if we can figure out a way to do it .
Bmr015_1088	But , um , ; this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ; OK . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . ; So what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ?
Bed013_589	They just want ASCII . ; Pure ASCII lines , ; OK . ; whatever .
Bmr027_371	Well Most ; But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local , ; Well , then ; except the ones who
Bed012_925	So . ; And form u starts at the level of noun Or actually , maybe even sounds . ; Phoneme . ; Yep .
Bro024_1923	Yeah , ; I was thinking to do that next week . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_585	In your case , if you tried just putting LDA , then maybe on - line normalization ? ; Only LDA . ; Yeah . ; Af - I after that I added on - line normalization ,
Bmr029_411	But it was such a bad baseline that I don't know what that means . ; Mmm . Right . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr005_963	And ; Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files . ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bro019_154	s my m my jobs are not getting run . " ; So I had to back off a little bit . ; But , ; soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available .
Bed012_215	Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question . ; So we 'd have a node for the Where - Is question . ; Yeah . But we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the Where - Is , ; and the Where How - do - I - get - to
Bmr007_669	D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . ; Right . ; Could we Could we , um ; we have have in the past and I think continue will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls .
Bed002_1034	cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d ; You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . ; d w ; These are not gonna get big in in the foreseeable future .
Bmr016_1506	Yeah . ; Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it ; because there 's a " Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1479	Hmm - hmm . ; Because then I will make the advertising that is still worth to stay here , ; And I hope then Siemens will say OK for me to stay longer here . ; And then I will come back maybe in the mid of end of January .
Bro028_437	Right ? ; So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise , ; where it 's voiced you use , uh , periodic pulses . ; Um .
Bro019_484	And uh , ; Yeah , ; I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks . ; OK .
Bed010_933	OK . ; The - th There there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh joint over in Saarbruecken . ; Exactly . ; Drive through , yeah .
Bmr009_71	Thanks . ; Or of things that ; No . ; Between
Bed015_588	I don't think it 's completely right . ; I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b ; the form did constrain the meaning , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2165	yeah . ; couldn't he ? ; Mari or or or Katrin , or Jeff , or ; Yeah .
Bed013_82	And answer , ; understand the answer , ; ask something else , ; and enter a dialogue with itself .
Bro005_701	Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . ; The MSG problem , ; um , ; the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate .
Bmr021_823	Oh right . Right , right , right . ; OK . ; OK . Ah OK . ; And then maybe another up
Btr002_3296	um , um , ; like once this is just such a rea ; I 'm getting down to like the really eensy - weensy stuff . ; But , um , once I found a comment that , uh , in in curly brackets about mumbling .
Bro017_339	You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening ; but it 's what 's happening in the in the close neighborhood . ; So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz , ; but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz .
Bmr009_31	Oh , that 's optional . ; No , that 's OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed003_1519	But ; That 's a different issue . ; This is going to be an interesting transcript . ; Hmm ?
Bmr019_973	Yeah . Cuz I thought I let you know about that . ; Thank you for mentioning . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , no , tha that That I think went away a couple of versions ago ,
Bmr019_451	So if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement . ; That looks good . ; OK . ; But it looks like it 's gonna bounce a lot .
Bmr011_448	NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . ; Is is he the one working on that ? ; Well that 's what they 're starting up . ; OK .
Bro013_791	And uh cuz because uh i it 's two syllables . ; It 's it 's more likely they 'll understand what I said . ; So that that that 's the habit I 'm in , ; but some people say " O " and
Bmr018_1184	I mean , this is tough for a language model probably ; Right . ; but but that might be useful just for speech . ; Well .
Bro017_462	Nobody said that yet . ; or ? ; I assume so . ; Hmm .
Bmr014_1095	then we bleep it . ; OK . ; Alright , so I think ; Yeah so if we have if i
Bns002_416	That 's it . ; That 's ; Yeah ? ; And that 's what I mean .
Bmr011_798	uh , looking , uh , uh , spending a lot of time with ; I 'm not quite sure the connection , ; but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . ; And I guess that I mean , I I need to read up on that .
Btr001_891	you know , ; Mm - hmm . ; so it 's like it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um , of of pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me . ; Mmm .
Bro024_1590	Because I did it I started working on Italian . ; No ? ; I obtained this average energy ; Yeah .
Bmr028_997	Yeah . ; No , actually , what Here 's here 's what we would usually do u under these circumstances . ; And pick whichever 's better . ; We would actually we would run some sort of segmentation .
Bsr001_1974	Yeah , ; yeah , but but eventually I mean , will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know , and and and in core technology . ; So I mean , recognition technology and also core , you know , algorithms , et cetera . ; And for those people to have these data will be , you know , the best way to , you know , develop the systems to an @ @ .
Bmr003_1800	It was horrible . ; OK . ; So thirty to one 's what you got ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_574	OK . Then I should have made that as an agenda item . ; I mean , Th - so these names that we 've been using so far are with ; uh uh uh ; I wouldn't just wanna change them you know , without some advance notice .
Bed014_923	I I uh you know I have no fixed ; To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible . ; OK . ; But I mean . I don't know .
Bed005_935	OK ? ; Right . ; And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things . ; That 's great !
Bed015_29	And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism . ; The ; wait . ; This is just one sheet , right ?
Bmr025_254	Yeah . ; Or S or Steve Renals . ; James Christie . ; Which one do I mean ?
Bed003_441	yeah . ; OK . ; Unknown , ; So final dest
Bmr031_111	Is it turned on ? ; There 's no on . ; Test . ; OK .
Bro005_466	Oh , OK , ; eighty - three point six and eighty eighty - eight point six . ; Eighty - three point six . ; Eighty
Bmr016_2158	and found segments that would be useful . ; And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done . ; In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually . ; Oh great .
Bro021_460	Well , um , maybe once we have this noise compensation , I don't know , we have to try that also , whether we want to go for C - zero or log energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; We can see that . ; Yeah .
Bro004_182	But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from ; Already , ; right right right . ; So .
Bed006_1586	Yeah , ; and you can always make it shortly after three probably . ; I mean . ; Yeah , and I don't need to be here particularly deeply .
Bed008_1440	or ; OK , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed014_244	Which ; This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? ; You know , and it 's cool , it works out that way . ; Hmm .
Bmr031_221	Um . ; Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation w on the test set . ; No , supervised adaptation . ; Supervised .
Bmr028_1196	Yeah . Something around there . ; OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell . ; But they are channelized ones , though ? ; No , no .
Bro017_436	We were after presentation we were driving home and he told me . ; When he knew you were happy , ; huh ? ; Yeah .
Bro018_993	right ? ; Yeah , ; but , you know , as opposed to the log in the other case . ; I mean the fundamental d d difference that we 've seen any kind of difference from before , which is actually an advantage for the P L P i uh , I think , is that the the smoothing at the end is auto - regressive instead of being cepstral uh , from cepstral truncation .
Bmr020_261	But ; Five percent of time or five percent of what ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I was gonna ask that too .
Bmr021_196	Mm - hmm . ; and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something . ; Yeah , eighty or ninety for the Shures . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_479	I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? ; Good point . ; So . ; That 's a very good point .
Btr002_1299	" ground truth " , as they call it , is very clear . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Buw001_1735	which you got a copy of today . ; Right . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , ; cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up ; Good .
Bro019_302	Yeah . ; yeah . ; I I can I 'm not sure about that one . ; yeah .
Btr001_2302	OK . ; Or giving permission ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_2368	Yeah . ; kinda like " Uh . " ; You know . ; Yeah .
Bed005_666	So what would ; Hmm ? ; OK . ; We don't I mean , that 's an issue .
Bed012_941	But , I mean , you know , you can probably count count the ways . ; I mean . ; It 's probab Yeah , I would s definitely say it 's finite . ; Yeah .
Bro021_966	but I I don't know . ; I I can do this incorrectly . ; Well , the expression that appear in the in the paper , is , uh ; The log
Bmr012_867	that 's not a problem . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; I mean I corrected all
Bro004_1019	Yeah , I have one . ; Were there other things that you wanted to ; Uh , no . I don't think so . ; Yeah , I have one .
Bmr002_401	OK . ; Oh , that 'd be super . ; What do they connect to ? ; Uh , keyboard .
Bmr015_805	Open wide ! ; but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it . ; I mean that 'd that 'd be nice ; but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential .
Bmr019_1016	So then you 're so and then you 're expected to backchannel ; Exactly . ; because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody . ; Exactly .
Bmr021_788	and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation , ; but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it . ; And then , you know , so we have the the SRI front - end ; and the ICSI front - end
Bed004_440	So . ; So in that case , the sum we 'd have we ; I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . ; We 'd have the summary nodes like
Bro028_1046	Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that . ; And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting the the , uh the feature selection thing , ; it 's a simple method , ; but I kinda like it .
Bro027_688	but ; Yeah , ; l ; But I think you have
Bmr012_489	uh . ; Good point . ; I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_531	Oh , oh , oh , oh . ; So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only w I mean , the same endpoints . ; But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one , ; so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the VAD .
Bmr027_188	Mm - hmm . ; It was it was not the best characterization . ; But what what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members . ; And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline ,
Bro027_1556	but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think you were .
Bmr012_668	yeah . ; Seems reasonable . ; I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question . ; Yeah .
Bro027_2034	Right . ; Um ; Mmm . So it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , ; but I just won't be at them .
Bed008_1513	I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here . ; So ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_430	Similarly prosody is not all of prosody ; but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed . ; Mm - hmm . ; that 's very nice ,
Bmr006_772	but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . ; You need truth . Hmm . ; Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_372	Isn't that great ? ; But about the need for transcription , ; I mean , don't we didn't we previously decide that the IBM transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ? ; So . Yeah .
Bmr023_273	uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . ; Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file . ; And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out . ; And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription .
Bed002_1245	Now , um Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . ; And so that we have it . ; And then um Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , ; we I control p
Bmr022_935	Yep . It just ha just hangs down there . ; Yeah , that I 've seen . ; Yeah . ; that hangs has the mike on it .
Bns002_456	So it 's acting , in in prin ; But not in the meantime . ; After receiving You know , in fact , probably the routing protocol will need to check the address the the let 's say IP address , which is inside the data packet , ; OK .
Bmr031_380	and , uh , transcribe on that basis ? ; That would be the hope . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bns001_1523	because everybody is paid here . ; So that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; But first of all Wilbert need more , definitely ,
Bed004_108	D Um . ; And um . ; The reading was five minutes , exactly . ; And now comes the
Bmr012_711	although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course ; but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects ; That 's true . ; and I don't know how that stands ,
Bmr024_1003	Ah . ; But normally you 're correct . ; But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated . ; But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again .
Bro019_1069	Yeah . ; and ; and uh , ; that we have uh , for the uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually .
Btr001_1351	Oh . ; Do they get them , um ; I don't know . ; Id - Is
Bro013_420	So probably it 'll be worse . ; Yeah ; Or in the basic perverse nature uh of reality . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_286	Right . ; Right . ; But I mean . ; Well someone someone might be interested in in it .
Bro023_1309	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um ; and the latency of this recursion is around fifty milliseconds .
Bmr029_839	in terms of get ; Oh , you mean for for his normalizations . ; Yeah . ; Oh , oh , oh . I 'm sorry .
Bmr014_983	It seems to me that sending them email , saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , ; Uh - huh . ; If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password " , ; seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise .
Bmr019_1846	We could do digits while other people eat . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it 's background crunching .
Bmr008_1146	I think that starts to There 's definitely some clear cases , ; I see . ; but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting , ; yeah .
Bed003_1303	Right . ; Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . ; Hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_859	And what 's the what wha So what has the data been ? ; What what what data are they using ? ; What is the ; Uh , Switchboard .
Bmr010_410	Um ; The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change . ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bmr018_537	That 's fine . ; Yeah , it 's true . ; So you can definitely streamline that with the i with the interface . ; Yeah , it could be faster ,
Bro008_480	so d ; well ; Actually , this is tha that 's why we ; well , it 's a different kind of data .
Bmr008_1679	Yeah . ; yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some non - voiced regions , at least you can have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure . ; Yeah . So . ; Yeah .
Bro005_40	Uh ; OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done ; Go ahead . ; It 's this .
Bmr024_476	And I think you 're in the process of doing that . ; So , you can you can ; Yeah . ; It 'll give you a lot more data , too .
Bmr003_1442	And this could be something that was handled by a table or something ; but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_580	Yeah . ; That 's more general . ; They could say Cincinnati or they could say Midwest or ; Yeah .
Bmr006_50	So ; he 's comes from a signal - processing background , ; but I liked him a lot ; cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody ,
Bro027_196	So . ; Uh , it might even be sooner . ; Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , ; seventeenth ?
Bro019_433	and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I see .
Bmr027_776	No , it 's backward - forward . ; Good point . ; A point . ; Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing .
Bed009_679	ye yeah I I think that 's that 's the um concept that people have , ; Yeah , yeah it it ; OK . ; yep .
Bns002_1108	But , again uh there are some proposals . ; Um , Miguel , are you familiar with these kind of proposals ? ; Not really . ; Not really , because I don't trust
Bmr006_546	Yeah . ; And and ; Yep . ; And so one That that will be done , like , in about two hours .
Bmr007_186	Yeah ; Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK . ; And and , you know , in contrast , so Deborah d and also Deborah Tannen 's thesis ; she talked about differences of these types , that they 're just different styles ,
Bdb001_501	We should we should find out . ; I mean , would the tools would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ? ; Um , th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail ; I mean , that I guess it 's a question that
Bmr023_686	finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , ; Yeah . ; and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , ; so where you know , if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based .
Bmr016_42	Um , ; So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have ? ; Liz ; Yep ,
Buw001_1953	CMU , ; Right . And then ; Right . ; J There 's
Bed009_582	So if there is resistance against changing it , that 's just because " Oh , We don't want to change things . " ; That that not deep reason ; OK , ; anyway .
Bmr024_371	but , I mean , m maybe it is a serious problem . ; Ho - what will they do when they go hear " beep seven beep seven three five two " ; I mean , you think they 'll we 'll get ? ; It 's pretty distinct .
Bmr016_495	Spend the whole time reading digits with different qu quantities . ; c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ? ; I thought this was gonna be fast . ; Oh well .
Bmr030_787	If we have the capability . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's like you build this room up for so long , ; and then it 's just like , you stop .
Bmr011_1435	I think they 're open to it . ; I think , you know , all these things are ; Oh , yeah . ; I think there 's
Bro007_607	we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh ; um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection ; and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now ; so that 's that 's another source of data .
Buw001_912	What ; Maybe maybe it 's no big deal . ; Maybe we just do it and see what happens . ; I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff .
Bro011_370	But then the other thing is to do something better ; and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? ; This is the ; Hmm !
Bed009_723	unless ; and it 's ; um uh ; you can access this
Btr001_1106	uh , I mean , don't wanna have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore , ; but , ; you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data . ; That kinda thing , maybe , uh , at some point .
Bmr016_1686	I i it 's the only ; There 's ; it 's the only pattern that has a slash after it , ; Well there 's not @ @ .
Bro010_484	So . ; Yeah . ; Uh , ; and there 's this
Bmr010_120	Do I I hear you you didn't ; Speech - nonspeech ? ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bed005_609	And get our best idea of what we should add . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then go back to them . ; Is i
Bmr003_1591	OK , my my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . ; Like I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . ; So if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a of someone 's , uh , uh , intonational contour , I I indicated it as , like what you just did . ; OK .
Bro018_984	what you can do is um you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one , ; Mm - hmm . ; which is what the typical mel mel cepstral uh filter bank does . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1677	Um And the length ; I mean ; Yeah . ; yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some non - voiced regions , at least you can have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure .
Bro023_756	I mean , no , ; I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent . ; And , uh , ; using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving
Bmr027_882	if ev but I 'm ; Don't you use VI ; for your mai ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_445	Why are why are they asking us ? ; So so ; Yeah . ; I don't know .
Btr002_206	OK , let 's say I say , " Well , that would be hard to do , so . " ; Mm - hmm . ; OK , right ? ; And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that " so that would be hard " , comma , " so "
Bro016_136	Yeah . ; Alright . ; OK . ; Uh .
Bmr026_381	You mean he won't set up the ; mmm . ; How much space do you need for these ? ; I don't know .
Bmr007_1256	so it 's in a private directory . ; That 's great . ; You have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_598	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1236	Darn . ; Put it in your , ; yeah . ; I guess this board works fine .
Bro026_240	So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the FFT level . ; Then ; Yeah , th then the mel filter bank , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1090	And and then this noise cancellation would get ; Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm saying That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . What 's really happening is ; Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , ; but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times .
Bro014_65	But in HTK , what 's the difference between , uh , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ? ; OK . ; So what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_862	And then , um ; If you do " man customs " , it has almost all of that . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed006_997	I mean that particular case , there 's mult there there 's a forced side of of that verb as well . ; Hmm . ; It maybe it means we had nothing to say about the Source - Path - Goal . ; OK .
Bro004_723	and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week . ; Yeah I ; So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , ; No ,
Bed017_75	but but I think I have the info now that I need . ; Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , ; so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done . ; And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again
Bsr001_1968	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; you know ; Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces
Bro017_114	OK . ; Y yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah but you have the same prob I mean MFCC basically has an enormous number of uh insertions .
Bro019_1073	It 's the far field mike . ; And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things . ; And that 's what most o ; again , most of our work has been done with that ,
Bed009_607	It 's really insane . ; and uh ; but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion . ; Or to enter his discussion , actually .
Bed008_558	so that 's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the ; As related from the user model . ; Right . ; So let 's let 's actually
Bro011_702	yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; So .
Bmr010_790	But but still , I mean , they they say ; I 've been eating a lot . ; I it makes their their job extremely easy . ; Uh .
Btr002_2603	Oh , that is too much fun . ; and " heh " . ; It wasn't anything special . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_604	But at any rate I think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need ; and I think we need a a conversation with ; Uh , maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it ; Just say " wha you know , what should we do right now ? "
Bmr027_1337	Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , ; uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , ; I never actually ; I I was asking about this .
Bmr002_730	on our speaker phones . ; Right . ; They they basically give ; um They subdivide into WAVE files
Bdb001_1049	It 's a Phil file ? ; Yeah . ; That 's my guess . ; Huh .
Bmr031_498	Yeah . ; So so ; So , uh , I th I I think it 's it 's , uh ; And they are gonna be using up a lot of disk ,
Bmr003_701	No . ; No , it doesn't ; but what a super tool . ; It 's a great environment .
Bro013_440	And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the um mel filter bank . ; Uh - huh . ; And , well , is more or less robust . ; Is good for clean speech .
Bmr013_1049	Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . ; Yeah ? ; Just start saying " M four " . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro015_23	It will be some sometime in summer . ; July or August , or . ; Yeah , I mean it may not happen . ; I mean he wants uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's he 's uh thinking of going someplace ,
Bro028_379	and then when you re - synthesize with LPC - twelve it went to five . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I mean We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges
Bed009_583	That that not deep reason ; OK , ; anyway . ; I if if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term . for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist .
Bmr003_603	so so one one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . ; And apparently that 's happened in the past . ; And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . ; Um , it will require a post pass ,
Bmr008_972	or " How easy is it for you ? " , ; or something like that where it 's ; How b How About " How long have you been uh in in an English speaking country ? " ; Yeah , that 's a good one .
Bed008_1347	you you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say . ; That 's one . ; And that 'd be one . ; So that um also seems to work fine .
Bed017_393	is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , ; and uh , ; I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems ; and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that
Bmr005_216	Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? ; Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , ; now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , ; I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .
Bmr027_1012	didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts ; Oh . I see . ; Yeah . ; or ?
Bro027_1999	Uh , that 's during Eurospeech . ; Oh , oh , right . ; OK . ; So , uh , Sunil will be in Oregon .
Bed012_315	OK . ; And , um , ; OK , and , ; Go - there has two values ,
Bed005_1015	It i i i ehhh , i ehhh . ; So , this is ; Wri - write it out for for ; Yeah .
Bmr022_136	Well , the only other issue is we 'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order . ; Uh ; Yeah . ; That I mean , just naming schemes will get
Bro005_764	With " two " , with " on - line - two " . ; yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , ; " On - line - two " is good .
Bed015_591	Yeah . ; and so , um , it isn't , uh ; Sure , but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France ? ; That is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really .
Bed010_520	so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . ; So , ; um , now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction ; he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , " your bike is parked across the street "
Bed014_191	That doesn't sound , exactly right either . ; OGI has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice ; and we 're going to use that . ; We can still , um , d agree on a gender , if we want .
Bro026_21	What was the update ? ; Yeah . ; So there is th then the all the new features that go in . ; The , um , noise suppression , the re - synthesis of speech after suppression .
Bmr026_837	And then we had some results on digits , uh , with um ; We We ; So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_795	in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , that kind of thing . ; You know what I would think would be a really n um , neat feature for the interface ?
Bro022_1167	And I want to know if if we have some feeling that the result ; Yeah . ; I I would like to know if ; I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain .
Bmr020_676	so you can get it . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Printed it out ,
Bro010_385	So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , ; what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . ; Just to understand it a little better I guess . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_2374	N no , ; I 'm I 'm I 'm serious . ; Does does the wireless thing work on your ; Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ?
Btr002_2904	because if you 're if you wanna speak next , it 's almost like you got y you gotta get your foot in the door . ; You gotta be the one who you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's true .
Bro025_635	so that actually comes after a chain of , like , LDA plus everything . ; So it 's , like , it takes a long time to get a decision out of it . ; And and you can actually do it for final frame - dropping , ; but not for the VA - f noise estimation .
Bed011_791	I must say that thi this one looks a bit strange to me . ; Um maybe It seems like appropriate if I go to Las Vegas . ; Well but I decide k kind of how much money uh I 'm willing to lose . ; But a I as a tourist , I 'll just paying what 's what 's more or less is required .
Bmr006_1114	Yeah , ; fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . ; OK . ; Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start .
Bns003_234	That 's my principle concern , ; because that will never be happen , from my point of view . ; It should be started as the edge device , ; so that it cu certain kind of mechanism , whatever , is enabled between the ingress edge device and the outgress a edge device ,
Btr001_1642	And this is when you crank up the visual . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you 've still got the maximum ; Yeah .
Bed003_1545	Mm - hmm . ; and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist ; Um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around ; so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer ,
Bmr002_654	I mean it won't ; Well , I don't know what will happen , ; but you may as well . ; I but but
Bmr027_754	Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah , there you go . ; Cuz we don't have enough asides . ; I have an idea .
Bro003_1294	and uh , then , you know , set it up in terms of scripts and so forth , and uh , in in kind o some kind of structured way . ; Uh . ; Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing . ; And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently ,
Bro013_272	It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder . ; Yeah . ; Uh . Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . ; I mean so take a look at the uh um , the SRI results .
Bsr001_770	don't you ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Btr002_3316	They used " mumble " for ; exactly . ; It was used in place of , uh , something that was in unintelligible . ; OK .
Bmr028_1519	You have to be willing to jump to something that 's quite different . ; Mmm . ; Interesting . ; And the first time you jump to something quite different , or maybe the first ten times or a hundred times you do , it 's gonna be much much worse ,
Bmr015_880	to to obtain the or to study the harmonics ; from from the spectrum directly , ; and to study the energy and the multiples of ; Yeah .
Bro022_542	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro017_1132	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_149	so this about as good as I can get ; Yeah . ; cuz it 's a fixed boom . ; Right .
Bmr014_540	exactly . ; But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you ; know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses ; Right .
Bmr013_635	So , current This week . ; so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , ; Yes . ; Might not be what you need .
Bed003_635	I guess that sort of makes sense . ; The reason I say the demo doesn't work very well is yesterday we uh observed everything in favor of taking a tour , ; and it came up as " Tango " , ; right ?
Bro003_1969	So , ; uh , the second class way of doing it is to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled ; and translate them into acoustic uh , uh articulatory , uh , uh , features . ; So it won't really be right .
Bmr019_1031	Right . ; It 's ; There you go . ; Well , but it 's interesting
Bmr007_1064	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , by the way , I had an idea with while I was watching Chuck nodding at a lot of these things , is that we can all wear little bells on our heads , so that then you 'd know that ; Yeah .
Bro011_522	or using ; using TIMIT ; right , right . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr024_720	It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's ; you know . ; It is different . ; You can't just fold it in as if it 's
Bro011_233	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns003_112	Ah , he 's very hard to sell . ; So it 's about one hour to put this , uh hard disk in ; and a further hour to , uh Well , two or three hours to install the operating systems . ; Nee , because then the network is still running then .
Bro019_656	Uh , ; but , well . ; I don't think it 's importa important ; because when they will change their metric ,
Bmr019_33	But ; Uh . ; Talk about aligning people 's schedules . ; Yeah .
Bro007_504	Three PM . ; Alright , that 's six in the morning here . ; It 's d ; Uh no
Bed013_1293	OK . ; If i if if it 's not at all triggered by our thing , then it 's irrelevant , ; Mm - hmm . ; and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment .
Bdb001_596	Is i ? ; You know , ; or something like that . ; I mean , w
Bdb001_986	And so ; Is there an is there an IP - API ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr031_1367	Right . ; And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation . ; So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that @ @ been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the in the Aurora , uh , team . ; And so , uh , they 've got some software
Bro025_102	Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals ; and you 're gonna end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . ; And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1886	because you see " beep " ; Right . ; and you know I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling , ; Right .
Bed012_345	Right ? ; That it Doesn't this assume , though , that they 're evenly weighted ? ; True . ; Like
Bro016_530	Mm - hmm . ; But that 's not really what this contest is . ; So . ; Um , I guess it 's OK .
Bmr028_1268	I mean , if you re - ran the recognition , then you just run it ; Right . Right . ; Oh , I see . ; If you wanna use the old
Bed005_243	And , of course , you can have i many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine . ; So , in a sense it 's pretty broad . ; OK . ; OK .
Bns002_745	And , uh what we are doing is we are uh taking the advantage that we are u we have this RTS CTS dialogue , in advance , before sending the data , to uh agree with the receiver , the power level he is willing to get from us . ; OK , ; so every single transmission in every single transmission we are checking with the receiver the power level we have to use for the data transmission . ; That 's the main thing .
Bro024_465	Is that it ? ; Hhh . ; That 's it . ; OK .
Bed002_48	Thanks . ; So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . ; All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , ; but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth ,
Bmr025_86	Yeah . ; especially for the information retrieval stuff . ; Anything else on transcription status ? ; Hm - mmm .
Btr001_1909	Mm - hmm . ; I 've never gotten to see her . ; Nn - mm . ; Oh , she 's here .
Bed005_1221	Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true . ; It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that . ; Right . ; I mean i You could have ,
Bro022_857	Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information , ; uh ; uh , ; you know , in the old days people would use energy
Bmr003_1341	For this exact task ? ; Are they linguists ? ; For transcription . ; It 's
Btr001_21	OK , thanks . ; Uh - huh . ; So , ; thanks very much for coming .
Bed003_523	but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you ; Yeah . ; Like it 's a conjunction of , ; I don't know ,
Bro017_1145	Yeah . ; Yeah , th that 's ; They have smaller means , also . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2563	For ours it will ; but we have a rear projector , ; so it 's in a separate room . ; Mmm .
Btr001_821	I like that . ; Yeah . ; Oh , it 's really a kick . ; I think that 's fun .
Bed006_1346	" Damn this project . " ; Why do you ; No just kidding . ; I don't know . Like
Bed009_434	OK , you can do this . ; And you just get information and give it to people . ; But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on ; Yep .
Bed015_1950	Right . ; But anyway . ; So , is is that does that make sense as a , uh a general way to proceed ? ; Sure , yeah .
Bed004_343	yep . ; Um , you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever , ; Right . ; or they were hurried .
Bmr010_833	e extra complications , like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of of the laughing through the utterance . ; It 's not so I don't think it 's , um ; And that and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying " curly brackets laughing " a after the unit . ; As as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words I think that 's sufficient ,
Bmr011_1796	No ? ; To to mark ; Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . ; The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , time things .
Bed003_448	but ; OK . ; so the the context being um , e ; I don't know if that question 's sort of in general ,
Bmr003_1456	there was some ; in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about I didn't worry about s specific start times . ; What do you mean by du ; I sort of thought that this is not gonna be easily processed anyway
Btr002_3254	Oh . ; OK . ; And what that means is at the time when we ; See we 're gonna go to a stage of anonymization .
Bed015_1383	Um . y ; Right . That makes sense . ; So I mean , there 's this stuff in the off in the scenario , ; which just tells you how various what schemas you 're using
Bed015_1717	Yeah . ; Nuh ? ; So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue . ; Yeah .
Bro011_220	and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't ; When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process ; or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? ; No .
Btr002_1549	Uh , right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_811	Well , that 's probably . ; So . ; Well , I can't calculate on my , on my feet . ; Do the transcribers actually start wi with , uh , transcribing new meetings , or are they ?
Bmr011_1159	and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . ; Oh , great , ; great . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_185	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1257	Exactly . ; and you could write it . ; Schemas uh that of that type . ; And then later , you know , there the we have a communication event action where we 'd define it down there as
Bed011_1046	Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly . ; So what I yeah , OK , So what what I meant was " Do a first cut at " . ; er that 's what ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro005_1005	Mm - hmm . ; where to put the MLP basically . ; Um . ; And I guess , you know , the the the real open question ,
Bro018_250	I know . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; But even i in
Buw001_917	So it 's sort of Landay supplying it ; so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . ; Right . ; So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero ,
Bmr010_967	Yeah . Why don why don't we just since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , uh , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions ; and ? ; OK . ; Um , um , the I I 'm really very for I 'm extremely fortunate with the people who , uh , applied and who are transcribing for us .
Bro018_736	Is that what you 're ; Right , Right , right ; f so for every phone there is there is a um a vector of ones and zeros f uh corresponding to whether it exhibits a particular phonological feature or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_397	Who 's the second Jeff ? ; Uh ; Oh , uh , do you know Geoff Zweig ? ; No .
Bsr001_685	I I mean , ou uh we we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago . ; and you 'll do the recognition . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_803	We clearly gotta add a few more features , though . ; Uh w what do you mean ? ; More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? ; No , uh front - end features .
Btr001_309	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; because of my c exposure and interest in German . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_442	so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote , ; We will ; but can come up with their with their own ; Yeah ,
Bmr025_784	Well . ; I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later ; so . ; and and and put some kind of summary or something
Bed013_1155	is or a thing thing that can be located . ; Right ? Ontology says this thing has a location slot . ; Sh - and that 's the thing that is being that is the content of the question that 's being queried by one interpretation of " where is X " . ; And another one is , um , path from current user current location to that location .
Bns002_868	if you have power control , sometimes you will use less than the maximum power ; How often do you use less power than the maximum ? ; Well , this will this will be connected to the motion pattern . ; OK ?
Btr001_2651	yeah . I looked for that too . ; Uh - huh . ; Up there at the top . ; Ah . Oh .
Bmr007_716	Yeah Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Seat number , that 's a good idea . ; I 'll do that .
Bed002_586	Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , ; which is what you have as context , ; and discourse context , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2020	Ah . ; d we we out of tape out of disk ? ; Great . ; No ,
Bmr022_698	I think that was Chuck . ; I 'll talk to him . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bmr025_410	Um . ; So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML ; because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now . ; I mean it works with Transcriber
Bro016_615	I mean , you could maybe use the ideas a similar idea to what they do in vocal tract length normalization . ; You know , you have some sort of a , uh , general speech model , ; you know , maybe just a mixture of Gaussians that you evaluate every utterance against , ; and then you see where each , you know , utterance like , the likelihood of each utterance . You divide the the range of the likelihoods up into discrete bins
Bed002_94	Yeah . ; Sure . ; Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . ; Right .
Bed017_776	Anyway . Yeah , so OK , so that 'd be great , ; but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again , ; right ? ; Absolutely . Yeah .
Bed004_363	Robert , ; Yeah , so um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person . ; Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours ; or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .
Bmr005_922	I have to to finish transcribing . ; So . ; I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_162	So he said , you know , " we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling " . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be ; I guess it would be the same .
Bmr003_713	Wow . ; That 's true . ; And so if the if if the issue really ; That 's interesting .
Bmr031_1217	Wisconsin fishing . ; With fishing . B ; Wisconsin fishing . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro028_222	Uh . Well , there are other things that we should do ; but , um , it requires time ; and We have ideas , ; like so , these things are like hav having a better VAD .
Bmr023_440	And , um @ @ I , uh the ; it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . ; But , it will be possible in the future ; Yeah .
Bro010_973	And , um , it didn't do nearly as well , ; especially in in noise . ; But the ; one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .
Bro028_78	Uh , yeah . So , the second thing is the system that we have currently . ; Oh , yes . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement , ; but if you want to stick to the this latency ; Well , it has a latency of two thirty ,
Bmr002_585	Yeah . ; Because , I d I I know that they published um i annotation tools , ; you know , for their ins ; Well , X Waves have some as well ,
Bmr021_230	Four more wireless . ; Um . ; And also I 'm gonna re probably replace the Andrea mike with a Shure , ; but I 'll test it , uh , sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works ,
Bro003_530	but I mean , I think the point is you have , uh , a bunch of labels and and they 're han hand uh hand - marked . ; Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked . ; It was automatically first , and then hand hand - corrected . ; But but , um , uh , it it , um , it might be a better source .
Bmr011_1024	OK , so this is a , um , ; I I guess I don't know what that means . ; and actually I should say this is what Don has b uh , he 's already been really helpful in , uh , chopping up these ; So so first of all you
Bmr016_2034	and ; OK . ; e by using scripts . ; Master copies of superset .
Bro010_1001	where they said " if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? ; I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . ; The - these same people ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1225	Well , I mean for the the energy . ; Right . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bmr024_846	Mmm . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; I didn't say that . ; Beep that out .
Bmr030_17	Yeah . Thirty . Whatever . ; So , uh , Morgan is , uh ; And the other condition is that they have to get a budget out , like , immediately , ; or the or they 'll give the money to someone else .
Bmr014_1173	I mean , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it the ; some something might sometime , and they uh
Bmr024_1250	Well , um ; So ; I just ; d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the
Bmr003_1060	Because they wanted a lot more detail ? ; No . ; Right . ; Because they had because they only had two speakers , right ?
Bro005_684	uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . ; Uh , but of course we don't have all the combination of these different parameters ; Um . ; s What 's this ?
Bro024_1753	Mm - hmm . ; And , yeah , ; i i i the condition where it 's better than your approach , it 's it just because maybe it 's better on well matched and that the weight on well matched is is bigger , ; Yeah .
Bed015_557	I don't know where that sits then , ; Hmm . ; sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant . ; It seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the the most basi
Bns003_880	That 's right . ; Yeah , ; so what I mean is at a certain degree , yeah , that has to be figured out . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1679	they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth . ; Hmm . ; Always fun . ; But it 's a , um , simple solution .
Bro023_1530	You said five hundred milliseconds ; but you said sixty - four milliseconds . ; Which is which ? ; What ?
Bro027_814	and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD . ; And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's great .
Bmr003_2131	What does that mean ? ; That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , ; Is it a speed bump ? ; So that the wires go through here .
Btr001_1699	Uh ; Yes , ; I agree . ; Hmm .
Bmr011_1677	about about tax cuts or something . ; I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room ; someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out ; that you can go to and like throw things and break things .
Bmr025_210	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , ; so that the normal UNIX function calls all work .
Bed012_363	right now . ; Makes sense . ; Yeah . ; So the But I guess the k the question that I was as er wondering or maybe Robert was proposing to me is
Bmr015_854	um , and the , uh ; e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap . ; Is height . ; Yeah .
Bed015_867	That 's fine , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_691	Well ther there 's ; and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do .
Bmr008_1761	or size - T or whatever it is ? ; I don't remember what it is . ; One of the problems , if the file is large , um , and you 're cast to the wrong type . ; I I I don't know ,
Bmr011_817	It 's like he 's he 's really up on these things . ; He 's he 's very ; Um , independently he asked , " well what about reliability ? " ; So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing .
Bro004_78	Uh . Uh . ; So . ; Oh wait wait wait wait wait . Wait . ; Get out of the
Bed016_229	or in the Bavaria example , ; you just want to know where it is . ; And so forth . ; So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge
Bmr022_138	Yeah . ; That I mean , just naming schemes will get ; We can definitely do that . ; So t so one question is , are there good places in the files where we can really do that ?
Bed002_559	Mm - hmm . ; It 's a granularity factor , ; Yeah . ; because where people ask you , " Where is New York ? " , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast .
Bmr031_294	Yeah . Well , we 'd ; And so , same issue . ; You know we just need to get someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it . ; We want that for sure .
Bro005_974	e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . ; Yeah . ; f But , yeah . ; Uh . But it 's another thing to try .
Bro024_571	Yeah . ; I do . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So by putting this noise
Bmr002_172	No , I was looking for the ones ; I threw the ones out , that we already recorded ; but we didn't record . ; Oh . OK .
Btr002_2307	I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , ; and " And they 're ; I don't know . ; This is a very different thing than most people can relate to , I guess .
Bdb001_1099	And so put , uh , a a green ribbon on for an overlap code . ; And since we w we ; I I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now . ; And so it 's nice to have
Bmr003_264	you know . ; Yeah . ; tapes . ; And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts ,
Bro023_879	Uh . Right now I don't think if it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped , ; because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra . ; Mm - hmm . ; But
Bro004_300	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is all eight kilohertz sampling . ; Yeah .
Bro014_99	So , ; uh , ; even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster . ; And then when you have your final thing , do a full one , so it 's
Bmr016_742	Um , ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits ,
Bed002_308	So , this is sort of how people may , uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . ; And we get tons of of these " how do I get to " , " I want to go to " , ; but also , " give me directions to " , and " I would like to see " . ; And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the the data
Bro012_1198	OK . ; So So many tell you something about that . ; Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise . ; Yeah ?
Bro028_539	So ; I mean , we ; W what 's what 's some of the lower error rates on on on uh , some of the higher error rates on , uh , some of these w uh , uh , highly mismatched difficult conditions ? ; What 's a ?
Bns002_356	really short packets . ; Let 's say eh eh 30 bytes or less . ; I assume so . ; Yeah .
Btr002_411	Yeah . If you if for some reason they didn't hear the " F " , if they didn't hear the " fuh " , it might just sound like ; " Gruesome " . ; Yeah , " grou " uh , " gruesuh " . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_910	And then the meetings that they attended , ; Mm - hmm . ; because there 'll be one form for each person . ; Sounds good .
Bmr005_112	Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . ; Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his " ; Wrong , ; yeah .
Bro014_1027	uh ; So . ; So how does ; uh , maybe I 'm going in too much detail ,
Bro018_221	maybe for the other one . ; Yeah , voiced - unvoiced hopefully would be a lot better . ; OK . ; for voiced .
Bro027_1166	yeah , it is . ; But , I 'm saying , there could be some some issues of ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_280	Anyway ; so let 's just leave it three with three for now ; Mm - hmm , ; mmm . Yeah .
Bmr022_831	It 's just w ; Then they have to be rewired though , ; I 'm just not sure what we should do . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1283	Yeah . ; I didn't either . ; Oh , that 's helpful . ; I found them to be just
Bmr011_435	So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight ; but do you think that , um that , uh , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . ; I have no idea . ; Probably not
Bmr010_443	Oh , we should definitely get with them then , ; and ; agree upon a format . ; Though I don't remember email on that .
Bed008_629	right . ; So why is it ; oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? ; Yea - n is that
Bed014_572	that they have admission fees , ; they have whatever . ; And then , this is We go via a thesaurus ; and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts
Bed005_1461	so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML . ; Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is is to just convert it int into a into a C P T that you zip ; It 's blown up , ; and is a it 's , uh it 's huge ,
Bns001_791	Nobody really wants a a guest on your network . ; Unless you get some money through some way uh through some way . ; Then , there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the Barwan project , as you said , go through proxies . ; There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies ,
Bed013_1229	So , um , ; let 's see . ; So I don't know if the I mean i if th just there 's more s here that 's not shown that you it 's already like part of the system whatever , ; but , " where is X " , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever ,
Buw001_77	OK . ; That kind of thing is good . ; It 's a ; This w
Bmr026_904	Mmm . ; But but yeah certainly if we , um ; If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . ; I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms .
Btr002_1745	And it was I mean it was kind of sad ; but it was , like , also really interesting to watch , ; or to listen to . ; Both .
Bed015_853	Mm - hmm . ; and then , ; Ways that you can get it come from th ; hhh , the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that .
Bsr001_2173	Mmm . ; OK , ; Mmm . ; yeah .
Bmr015_638	um , um , ; once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . ; As you might expect , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_915	Uh a link between the action schema , a field in the s in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use ; so we could ; Yeah . ; Um , well that 's that 's one one thing is that we can link up ,
Bro028_328	if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then I 'd say " boy , LPC n twelve is pretty crummy " . ; You know ? ; Uh - huh . ; So I I I 'm not sure I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance .
Bed004_787	Right . ; Could . Uh . ; Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1572	Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , ; and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . " ; So . Which , I mean , n ; these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup ,
Bdb001_1084	Yep . ; um ; Easy easy to map . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1197	and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one ; Mm - hmm . ; vers ; It 's probably pretty easy do it to do it in HTML ,
Bro024_946	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; So it 's not the mel . ; You know , it 's not the mel filter bank output .
Bed005_1499	Well , you and I should talk about it . ; Yeah , uh - huh . ; OK . ; Alright , great !
Bmr005_548	Right . ; isn't it , ; over the whole meeting . ; Yep .
Bmr020_457	I mean , we miss a lot of them , ; Yeah . ; but but it 's f i i ; That 's OK
Bed015_982	Now I don't know whether ; I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions ; on like focus , right ? ; Um , topic it seems kind of you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing .
Bed004_251	Mmm . ; So , I my guess is she 'll be r r quite happy to take on that job . ; And , so ; Yep .
Bmr014_926	So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . ; Right . ; And then if they don't , you 're done . ; If they do , then he provides them access to the the web site .
Bed016_835	There was a ; Well , it may be just " out " . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1497	Yeah , it 's good , ; This is really really helpful . ; yeah . ; functionally pretty , you know , also
Bmr011_1750	Yeah . ; That 's true . ; So I I think it 's just , ; OK .
Buw001_1008	How fascinating . ; and ; And see score them ? ; They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain
Bro013_246	Right ? ; I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over .
Bro022_1064	to see whether it really h helps or not . ; I mean , it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . ; And ; it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter
Bmr028_1195	Right . They 're somewhere in between January and late March , or something like that ? ; Yeah . Something around there . ; OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell . ; But they are channelized ones , though ?
Bmr024_841	Yeah . ; But that 's that 's that 's risky . ; Yeah . You really shouldn't be saying ; Mmm .
Bed006_1130	The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; you know so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right .
Bed011_244	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So this is a question for you ,
Bmr001_169	Not have it ; Yeah . ; but ; Yeah .
Bmr019_749	Well , the ; I I think you can do better by uh , cloning ; so we have a reject phone . ; And you and what we wanted to try with you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , uh , t cloning that reject model
Bsr001_849	Right . ; You you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform . ; That 's good . ; Which , uh Wha - Evaluation of
Bmr024_416	Mm - hmm . ; So there was some Uh In in Adam 's agenda list , ; he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ? ; Well , yeah .
Bed008_634	yeah ; uh I I think ; I see . ; Hmm .
Btr001_1928	But anyway . ; Yeah . ; She always tends to get interrupted . ; Hmm .
Bed014_1165	but ; Yeah . ; OK , yeah , understood . ; But that 's part of the formalism
Bmr001_447	Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have we um ; If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed014_331	and ; uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . ; So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances ; and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff ,
Bro007_551	But they 're ideas . ; Yeah ? ; Oh , that was good . ; Yeah .
Bro014_357	and , uh , it would have reasonable reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; I I guess what I 'm
Bed015_412	Mm - hmm . ; By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back . ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bmr029_432	I mean , do you ha do you have to rely on his segmentations at all to do the top one ? ; No , no . We would use the same segmentations , ; but he needs to extract extract the wavef form segments from a different channel . ; Oh . OK .
Bed006_1756	Do you see what I mean ? ; but if you if you if you work in th in that XML community it is a great acronym ; Like ; because it e evokes whatever RDF
Bmr026_977	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh it was I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .
Bro008_157	Yeah . ; I think everybody was focused elsewhere . ; Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . ; So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits .
Bro010_534	Mm - hmm . ; But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , uh , with some forgetting factor or something . ; So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? ; Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum .
Bro026_987	Yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , ; right ? ; So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , ; uh , and and so everybody goes to phonemes .
Bmr024_146	every once in a while , @ @ uh , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps . ; Yeah . ; Into two pieces . ; Yeah .
Bed004_544	Add extra properties , ; a deterministic rule for every property ; you have an action , " pppt ! " ; You do that .
Bro026_1057	You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Or is it cor you know , is it ? ; I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones .
Bmr021_994	I don't know , ; uh eh . Fff . ; What would you like it to do when that happens ? ; Well , no , if if you um
Bro004_283	Yeah , um . ; actually ? ; Yeah . ; Um . The English data No , the multilingual databases are two times the broad English data .
Bro003_390	Mmm . ; Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? " ; you know ? ; Um , and Uh , however , you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation .
Btr001_1012	Yeah . ; There 's a study done on when people say " uh " and when people say " um " . ; Yeah , I 'm sure it 's ; Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation ,
Bro003_1448	No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops , ; right ? ; And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_108	so ; Mmm . ; California . ; I think
Bed004_479	Um , ; Uh , ; Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc . ; This is sort of th the second version and I I I look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John Johno said .
Btr002_1272	and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said , ; and then you would listen to it , ; and everyth the j ; there were two parts to the task ,
Btr001_1873	if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever , ; I remember from the very beginning , I would go to tea and start recognizing voices . ; but it ; Oh , that 'd be interesting .
Bed003_712	Right . ; " How do I get to the bank ? " ; I see . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_403	Well , we we we wanna have them . ; You mean there 're more than ten ? ; Yeah , I ; Anything else ?
Bmr010_862	Yeah . ; Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing . ; Um , and that 's , uh I don't think that we can do very well with that . ; Right .
Bmr018_1368	What was their rough what was their conclusion ? ; Yeah , read Wall Street Journal . ; It works . ; Yeah .
Bro022_269	because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , ; which are then being subtracted from the speech . ; And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number ; and sometimes you won't .
Bmr010_696	But it does happen . ; Right ? ; I mean , and any ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1635	but it it matters more in some situations than in others , ; and it and also there 's there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways . ; I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using , ; Right .
Bmr011_376	yeah . ; Oh , that 's interesting . ; So that that 's the cross - correlation stuff , was was doing b beam - forming . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2306	Yeah . ; in a way . ; Same with " I don't know " . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_578	Yeah ? ; So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . ; The only ; Hmm .
Bed008_1224	I don't , yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support something like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . ; Right .
Btr002_2300	and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " . ; And they 're they think I 'm like a stenographer or something . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_551	it could be in its own channel , ; it could span time boundaries of any type , ; Right . ; it could be instantaneous ,
Bmr024_93	Yeah . ; But , uh , we 're we 're basically ready to do it . ; And , uh , I have some web pages on ts more of the background . ; So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date .
Bmr016_398	OK . ; Oh ! ; Wait oh it these are all the same forms . ; Sixty - one .
Bro022_787	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . ; yeah .
Bed002_135	Um . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , ; and record it , ; and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . ; So that 's my particular interest ,
Bmr021_525	Right . ; Yeah . ; So , maybe we should do that ; Yeah .
Bmr008_147	Yeah . ; not on the meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; You could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships
Bns001_550	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_548	is that is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right , I mean , the it 's sort of it 's a little In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it with Switchboard
Bed009_562	or It 's really gonna be an action planner . ; And i it ; It oughta be called a a dialogue manager . ; cuz that 's what everybody else calls it .
Bmr027_1322	Good . ; just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2264	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; It sounds like it 's a nice smooth melody , ; but these things are voicing and unvoicing , are tripping in and out ,
Bmr025_68	Excellent . ; Yeah . ; Good . ; Is my mike on ?
Bro014_217	but the points that they were supposed to discuss is still , uh , things like the weights , ; uh ; Oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora participant sort of thing . ; For
Bed005_1018	Yeah . ; I mean ; Enter , ; View ,
Bmr016_571	but I think e just having the results there , ; and pointing out some main conclusions ; like it 's not the speaking style that differs , ; it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors .
Bro017_378	Yeah . ; So . ; But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down . ; So essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands .
Bro015_71	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Uh but it sounds like none of this is really decided , that this is how things are leaning ; This
Bed013_777	You know , hopefully you can you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of , you know , without going into this intense detail . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So it be like using the formalism rather than you know , introducing it per se . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1619	Um . ; Good . ; Yeah , ; I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question .
Bmr016_613	Yeah . ; which we had uh about uh about the alt over all the channels ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr001_820	Yeah , but Yeah . ; If it 's you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing , ; or do you point , ; or I don't know .
Btr002_513	And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices ; and they 're getting picked up on more channels , um , than their own channel . ; That would make that would make some sense . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1545	Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather ; Mm - hmm . ; but that 's what he wanted me to show him . ; So I 'm giving him our , um our initial meeting
Bro012_1299	Mm - hmm . ; we used we d did some of this stuff . ; Uh I I did , some years ago , ; Yeah .
Bed009_693	yep . ; but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh a service is gonna come and describe itself to you . ; and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in in in the DAML uh project where um you you find a GIS about that gives you information on Berkeley , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1076	I 'm wondering about a question like , " Where are you from mostly ? " ; Yeah . ; But I I 'm s I 'm now that you mentioned it though , I am really am confused by " Northern " . ; Yeah .
Bns002_19	Of course . ; Eh , well , I 'm working in the em Broadband Commu ; Uh , sorry , one interruption . ; This is not related to hearing ,
Bed014_1364	So anyone else would like uh ruin the balance of ; Anyway . ; Well , but Well . But th th then w then we have to come back to the bigger group . ; Right .
Bmr022_1391	Gotta go . ; but . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I like that idea
Bed006_704	how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the Enter Source - Path - Goal ; that this But this sort of gets the job done in that respect ; and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we 're talking about two different things . ; We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there ,
Bmr030_227	Yeah , have you guys seen the display ? ; Have you guys seen either of the demos ? ; They 're pretty cool , ; No .
Bed010_622	It 's it 's spatial reference frames . ; You actually have only ; Um . If you wanna have a ; This is usually um
Bed003_843	explain to me why it 's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public . ; Or , if something ; It seems like it 's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_155	So it 's um I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's really pretty clean data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_748	right ? ; the ; right ; Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .
Bed008_1122	is that what that ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean ; it 's and I don't think it 's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way ,
Buw001_566	and ; Never . I 've never seen it at ICSI . ; Does anyone ? ; I mean , Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes ,
Bmr012_266	So ; And is it only once that that happens ? ; But ; yeah
Bro027_1274	Uh , that 's right , that 's right . ; Um ; Well that that says that , you know , the , um the models in in , uh , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1465	and find out the best excitation . ; They work on the code book excitation . ; Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis . ; They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best .
Bmr008_590	Well , there could be a circle one . ; It depends . ; I guess there 's a ; Right ?
Bmr019_1675	You can find , uh , problems with with the transcripts , ; It 's always Morgan 's fault . ; um , you know , ; Oh .
Bmr009_489	So . ; Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different . ; Yeah . ; Right . Right .
Bns003_750	Mm - hmm . ; You can change that . ; Yeah , ; sure .
Bmr020_178	Yeah . ; But re well regardless . I think it 's he 's he 's in all of them , ; Oh . OK . ; I mean , we didn't mention Morgan by name
Bmr016_2278	No . ; I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription ; OK . ; So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts ,
Bro005_1017	And y ; y Right ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; And then um then see , again , how
Bro022_885	it plus energy plus timing information is sort of ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_194	Yep . ; But I mean , I guess I guess the thing is , uh , this is another , smaller , case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty , ; which makes me think Bayes - net should be the way to solve these things . ; So if you had If for every construction ,
Bmr020_446	and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences . ; So , ; you know ; Di - did you use upper - lower case also , or not ?
Bmr027_1372	Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something hasn't , uh ; I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , ; and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner ; and and and I 'll I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation .
Bed015_922	Yeah . Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah , all all of those . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_536	I mean , this thing wearing sideway that that can ? ; Uh the ; It 's wired . ; It 's funny , I li I kind of like this .
Bro017_1032	because then y you just write the " do " - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Exactly .
Bmr031_1631	Right , right . OK . ; like you might use a median , ; m Median , yeah . ; Right .
Bro018_840	um ; Yeah , that makes sense , to check all that . ; Yeah . ; So I was doing that first , before I did these other things , just to make sure there wasn't something
Bed013_1099	which can be p you know , should be maps to something that activates both . ; I mean the idea is to ; I don't ; Alright , OK .
Bmr016_2217	Well it 's just we 're missing tea . ; Yeah , I know . ; So . ; No , but I mean my question is like should I wait until all of those are processed , and channelized ,
Bed014_805	Yeah . ; Right . Well I That 's tentative . ; They aren't decisions , ; Yeah . Right , right , right .
Bro012_1070	Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use . ; Uh . If the use the small VAD ; I th I think it 's on ; I think it 's easy to do better
Bmr029_201	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Because ; For the test .
Bmr011_1019	because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns001_931	but uh ; yes , the mapping of course between multicasting and the UMTS or or whatever ; In next generation ? ; Yeah .
Bmr005_401	I see . ; OK . ; Yeah . So I think Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1096	Uh . ; Right ? ; I mean , it 's just running the data through ; Oh .
Bed009_599	Yeah . ; Yeah I think just the the spatial planner and the route planner ; I showed you once the interac action between them among them in the deep map system ; Right .
Bmr031_1274	Um , ; you know , f apart from getting preparing the the da the data for the , ; um for these experiments for the , um , uh for this prosody workshop , ; um , we just , um we just had a phone call with Mari and her students , in fact ,
Bmr027_762	Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages , ; But , ; ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1056	So your your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there . ; Mmm . ; On an XH uh , X X whatever partition . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_138	Oh . I see . OK . ; Well , it s It seems like right now if if u what they 're complaining are those , ; And so ; Huh , I remember that now .
Bed014_278	It was written by committee . ; Anyway . ; Um . ; But c the meeting looks like it 's , it 's gonna be good .
Btr001_293	cuz I can catch a lot of things ; like like " No , that 's not what she said " , ; I can tell she 's pronouncing pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a you know , a Spanish speaker 's mind that you would , you know , pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish . ; But the same time , uh I can't get most of it ,
Bmr014_1245	but um , I 'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress . ; Yeah . ; I don't really have anything specific to to talk about . ; That 's fine .
Bmr015_242	OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the NSF . ; I sent this ; actually this is maybe a little side thing . ; Um , I I sent to what I thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to ,
Bmr013_356	Mm - hmm . ; because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . ; Right . ; So people purposely don't add them .
Bmr022_1278	CVS is pretty good . ; So then you could use CVS ; and , you know , just f have remote access , ; OK .
Bro015_187	Mm - hmm . ; They didn't , I don't think , reported timing for those , ; but um it turns out that the one that they 're actually using was not the best , uh in in their series of experiments , which I uh Maybe it 's because they uh wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages and this was only done on Italian or something . ; Sure .
Bmr029_226	Right ? F . ; Is it this one ? ; It 's e F . ; F .
Bro014_66	OK . ; So what happens is , um , at each one of these points , you increase the number of Gaussians in the model . ; Yeah . ; Oh , right !
Bro018_1098	and that adds up to six seconds of speech . ; And I calculate um the spectral mean , of the log magnitude spectrum over that N . ; I use that to normalize the s the current center frame by mean subtraction . ; And I then then I move to the next frame and I I do it again .
Bro014_1551	So that 's ; That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it . ; That was it , huh ? ; OK .
Bro017_301	Mm - hmm . ; But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents , ; for instance a question is like " how correlated are the elements of this vector ? " ; Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones ,
Bmr025_104	What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? ; Keywords . ; OK . ; I see .
Bdb001_1056	Um , ; so ; Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway . ; Great .
Bmr020_550	Yeah , ; This is just a statistical correlation , ; right . ; No , no , no .
Bro012_742	Uh - huh . ; The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice , ; and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form . ; It 's just the first
Bmr006_1586	Well , I mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_623	And actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora , they did run into limitations ; and uh , certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach ; is because of the of the filtering . ; Hmm .
Bro027_249	OK . ; And , uh , they added me to the list ; uh , the mailing list . ; OK ,
Bns003_910	I 've , uh , contact one more time the professor , ; what is his name ? ; Rao ? ; or ?
Bmr015_70	I 've been but but uh , well ; Well if we Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in . ; I 'm actually pretty busy today , ; Yeah .
Bed006_693	OK . ; Yeah . ; Also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future . ; So this is something that , you know , may also be a res As a result of your work
Bmr006_1288	And you find They get peaks . ; So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . ; So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . ; OK . OK .
Bsr001_2164	Well , he could be reached he could be reached by the far field , ; yeah . ; couldn't he ? ; Mari or or or Katrin , or Jeff , or
Bro010_401	Uh , I mean , it doe did look like it buys you something over just the KLT . ; Yeah . ; But maybe it 's just the discrimination ; and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary .
Bmr021_224	And I 'm ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Cool .
Bed015_842	In in real speech , um , people may put stress . ; It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_514	But I meant to have see @ @ two two the picture . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; This is , for example , for one frame .
Bro011_479	and is learned with EM . ; So he doesn't have ; Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that ; which means that it 's it 's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band .
Bro007_290	It the the output silence of the MLP . ; Oh yeah ; I see . ; It 's only one small experiment to know what happened .
Bed013_758	Like , NLP cognitive neural . ; you can say that construction - based ; You know ; So i so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side
Buw001_85	How 's that working ? ; It 's a ; It 's working . ; OK .
Bmr009_482	Mmm , no , ; if it 's if i if it 's ; Tone ; Well , it won't be as big .
Bed009_403	No , in SmartKom terminology that 's um called a function that 's modeled by a function modeler . ; And it 's th that 's completely um encapsulated from th the dialogue system . ; That 's simply a functionality that you give data as in a query ; and then you get back from that mmm , a functioning model um which might be a planner or a VCR or whatever .
Bro025_501	Yeah . I was wondering about that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; That was I I had written that down there .
Bmr020_599	and that they tend to happen when uh the pitch drops . ; You know you get a falling pitch . ; Yeah . ; And so that 's when people tend to backchannel .
Bro027_117	Aurora . ; Um , it was on the SpeechDat - Car . ; Yeah . ; So I tried a hundred to four K .
Bro028_868	And and that that , um , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ? ; I don't remember that . ; And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bns001_453	So one layer is having the seamless handover . ; It 's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service , you can't do magic and have it . ; There are certain constraints on that . ; It 's true .
Bsr001_187	but it doesn't actually do anything else ? ; OK . ; Doesn't do anything , ; no , no .
Bed010_1067	And um , the the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ? ; No , I I think I 'll be done everything by this uh by the end of this week . ; Same with you ? ; No .
Bed016_1171	We c we can show people pictures of objects ; and then have then ask the system about the objects ; and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1255	So ; Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ? ; I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that . ; I think most of them are pretty good .
Bmr009_366	both people talk more softly ? ; I don't think this happens at all . ; Or or what if what if the equipment what if the equipment adjusts somehow , ; Or they get louder .
Bro023_798	But it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result . ; So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1711	" TCL " . ; Where do you see that ? ; Uh ; Oh , oh .
Bmr025_707	So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . ; And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the ; but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . ; I do take notes ,
Bmr019_1909	OK . ; Remember to read the transcript number , please . ; And you laughed at me , too , f the first time I said that . ; Right .
Bed002_596	Whatever . ; Yeah . ; So we can work out terminology later . ; Yep .
Bro028_600	Oh ! Good . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Cuz we 'll
Bed008_114	because um this case it 's pretty simple , ; but as we will see the other ones um ; for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? ; So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished .
Bro021_869	but Y is what ? ; Y of the spectrum ; Uh , this this is this ; or ?
Bmr027_148	And um . ; So , you have it nicely set up so they email you ; and , uh ; When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me .
Bro007_284	Yeah . ; Um what else is there here ? ; Um see the second second from the bottom it says SIL , ; but this is some different kind of silence or thing or
Bed005_987	I was envying you and your pocket ; cause I don't have one . ; It was a quick one , huh ? ; That 's why they invented " pocket T 's " .
Bmr005_734	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; So . Then you can get the Cuz you need ; OK .
Bmr019_878	since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that . ; Right . ; Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1412	Just it takes you know , it just takes five minutes rather than , taking a second . ; OK ; Yeah . ; Right ,
Bmr019_70	R r right . ; That 's not good . ; So we have to we ; Plus , it would make for interesting noise background noise .
Bed006_740	right ? ; the input into the action planning , as it is now . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_616	Yeah , something happened . ; I don't know what . ; He asked for more work . ; Huh .
Bmr024_504	There were the false alarms . ; Yeah . ; So , r right now you get f fal you know , false false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , breath or something like that , ; OK .
Bro024_633	The the w there was a very long discussion about this on on the on the , uh , Amsterdam meeting . ; Yeah . ; How to how to calculate it then . ; Yeah .
Bed016_513	Uh . No , that 's quite possible . ; That 's copy and paste from something . ; So I did note ; i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet .
Bro007_480	We don't know is happening . ; Yes , so I mean I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday ; Tuesday . ; Yeah , well .
Bro004_656	Uh . Yeah . ; Oh I see , OK . ; Just uh ; Yeah .
Bmr009_232	Yeah . ; right ? ; That 's that sort of hypothesis . ; That 's right .
Bro025_255	We cou we can do better , I think , ; Mm - hmm . ; because , um , with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent ; and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent .
Bmr031_1348	after he did some adjustments , more like a percent or so that that i th absolute , that it goes goes down ; Yeah . It 's a P H ; and ; But is it still true that basically the s speaker adaptation , um , sort of negates much of the advantage ?
Bro023_1616	I see . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; Yeah , for for sure I will .
Bmr021_897	It gets pretty big . ; It does get pretty big . Yeah . ; Hmm . ; And m my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better .
Bro010_216	And then we do it . ; And then someone else does something that 's straight forward . ; So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise ; and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise .
Bmr016_741	I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too . ; Um , ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1171	but we So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels . ; We 're ; from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files , ; which essentially has it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration .
Bmr016_266	OK . ; you know , it 's just There 's so many things . ; OK . ; it 's it and and enunciation .
Bro018_84	Oh . R ; R R - zero . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1271	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr023_1099	from the original PLP , ; Right . ; which is right . ; N
Bmr023_51	She can just walk in , I guess , or ; I think ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro019_738	Yeah . ; in each set you have a range of conditions ; Well ; Right .
Bro012_677	Yeah . ; Dave , the other thing , actually , is is this business about this wave form . ; Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , ; cuz
Bmr003_2149	Yeah . ; I guess . ; Uh , because the ; How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ?
Bmr008_535	Yeah . ; I see . ; Very just a limited number ; OK .
Buw001_2151	Yeah , OK . ; Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . ; It 's things occur without any ; You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes ,
Bmr031_1248	The twentieth ! ; Yeah . We 'll have it all straightened out . ; Yeah . ; So . It 's gonna be a busy week .
Bns002_836	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; For example , with transmission or or whatever , ; Yeah , ; sure , sure .
Bmr020_1629	and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_79	OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . ; And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk one type of constituent , ; that is a constructional constituent . ; I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind .
Bro017_461	Are people supposed to rerun their systems , ; Nobody said that yet . ; or ? ; I assume so .
Bro004_559	Mmm . ; On on um ; So . Um , ; oh I well , wait a minute .
Bmr010_268	But , um , ; Susanne Bur - Burger , who is at se CMU , he wa who was formally at in Munich and w and is now at with CMU , ; she said she has something ; which she uses to do eight channels , uh , trans transliterations ,
Bmr003_1618	And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . ; OK . ; But in any case I didn't mark those . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_613	I I think s I think support vector stuff sort of goes back to to that kind of thing . ; I see . ; Um . ; So rather than doing nearest neighbor where you compare to every single one , you just pick a few critical ones ,
Bed004_142	This is the system breaking down , actually . ; " Did I call Europe ? " ; So , this is it . ; Well , if we we um
Bed005_364	Oh , OK . ; No , this is not it . ; Uh . I can't find it now . ; You mean , where the where the act how the action " Goodbye " maps into something
Btr002_1333	so I don't think you could use a string search , right ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked . ; Mmm .
Bmr022_927	What does that ; You you put it over the corner of your ear . ; Yeah , over the corner of the ear ; I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here .
Bro022_1134	Well , thinking about that , we we then we decide that maybe is a good idea . ; We don't know . ; I don't hav ; I don't
Bmr005_1083	there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflections . ; Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something ; and then there 's a there 's an echo . ; It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .
Bed009_396	first go there ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , you know , take a bus " , ; whatever it is .
Bmr006_498	Well put . Well put . ; So , after the transcript screening phase . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Things have been weeded out .
Bmr031_1145	Right . Right . ; So . ; And then , uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_768	Great ! ; OK , guess we 're done . ; OK . ; Well , although by the way .
Bmr013_64	Well , some of us . ; I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand . ; Just myself , rather . ; So it will not take long .
Bns003_995	Now I ; so ; no , no , ; because that 's , uh , that 's why I mentioned that it is important thing .
Bro014_315	And , um , ; so they said " how much is significantly better ? ; what do you ? " ; And and so they said " well , you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " .
Bmr023_564	I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , ; or something like that . ; And , I mean , I would say " no " . Like , I don't wanna know , ; but some people might be really interested
Bmr003_2136	Oh , is that right ? ; Wow . ; I never heard that . ; Yeah .
Bed011_496	and " tour the university , castle or zoo " , ; mm - hmm Yeah . ; all of these d do have this kind of " tour " um aspect about the way you would go to them . ; And uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a " attend " et cetera .
Bmr002_1047	It 's like the PDA thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , imagine that we had Meeting Recorder all done , and you had one , ; what might you do with it ?
Bro005_612	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Alright .
Bro016_904	Yeah , sure . ; Uh . ; Hmm ? ; Yeah .
Bmr027_361	Because people don't read their email , ; or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that , ; I 'm not gonna delete anything " ; and they don just won't reply to it .
Bed010_351	Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem . ; We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff . ; Yeah . ; That 's separable ,
Bns002_1258	Yeah . ; Yeah , but you know , uh in fact ; OK . ; uh the initial version had only the the range of ten meters ,
Bmr021_937	Vocal tract thing , ; Wh ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bdb001_856	I guess I 'm just a little hesitant to try to go whole hog on sort of the the whole framework that that NIST is talking about , with ATLAS and a database and all that sort of stuff , ; So ; cuz it 's a big learning curve , just to get going . ; Hmm .
Bdb001_740	So i if it ; but can you do it sort of l l you know , it ; I I mean , I can't do it , ; but I can
Bed005_1194	So , this is much smaller than that . ; Asymptotically . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed010_275	the report on these ; the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week . ; Yeah . ; It 's alright .
Bed014_424	Anyway , so , uh , with a little luck ; Uh l let 's , let 's have that as a goal anyway . ; And ; So , uh , what was the date there ?
Bro022_1028	There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are . ; o ; Uh - huh . ; So that was one of the bugs that was there in estimating the noise .
Bmr007_1269	Yeah . ; OK , good , digits . ; Yeah , since we wanna possibly synchronize these things as well . ; Oh , I should have done that .
Bed003_860	OK . ; So , the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel . ; It 's the hotel Zum Ritter , ; which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah .
Bro012_156	Yeah , at first I had a remark ; why I am wondering why the PDA is always so far . ; I mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the PDA 's there . ; Uh . I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it .
Bro014_1366	I see . ; Yeah . ; So , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_336	Mm - hmm . ; Anyway , ; so it 's uh ; That was that was one set of results ,
Bmr021_938	Wh ; Yeah . ; OK . ; yeah .
Bed003_1373	It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . ; It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , ; so , um , ; because you say " OK , how can I get to the castle ?
Bed010_206	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But but we we 're swit ; and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .
Bns003_709	Usually it 's an application work . ; So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , whatever , ; Mm - hmm . ; or a program or
Bmr006_29	but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . ; So , I th I think I think we should start doing that . ; Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . ; uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,
Bmr014_779	I 'm not a law lawyer , ; but it strikes me that uh , we wouldn't want someone to say " oh yes , I was a little concerned about it ; but it was too hard to access " . ; So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it .
Bed003_191	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Right . ; But
Bed003_1459	I thought there was a line that went from somewhere , ; maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago , ; but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_590	but I didn't have a choice . ; Wow . ; I mean , I couldn't type . ; That 's an interesting language model I 'm sure .
Bdb001_122	It 's an O instead of an I , ; but the D is good . ; You like the D ? ; Yeah .
Bro007_110	Yeah . ; An ; Yeah ; there is something funny happening here because
Bed009_644	and it cant sort of formulate its what it wants in a in a rather a abstract uh way , ; you know f " Find me a good route for this . " ; Mm - hmm . ; It doesn't really have to worry ab how route planner A or how route planner B actually wants it .
Btr001_2013	And they 're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see , ; Really hard . ; Yeah , ; and it 's hard
Bmr011_99	And so , uh , it it 'd be better if we had close talking mikes for everybody . ; Right ? ; Is that is that basically the point ? ; Ri - um ,
Bmr018_823	Ah , OK . ; Yeah . ; and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . ; So , um , if we d
Bmr022_1141	Yeah . ; Well , but You have a choice . ; Either you let people do it themselves , or you don't . ; Yeah .
Bro025_664	Um . ; Um . ; Yeah . So probably the VAD and and maybe testing out the noise estimation a little bit . ; I mean , keeping the same method
Btr002_58	um , so there 're a couple of examples . ; I have one in front of you which is the one where , ; um , um , u ; Leah Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the transcriber interpreted it as " twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this " ,
Bmr005_540	right ? ; Although the other issue is that the mixed close - talking mikes ; Yeah . ; I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .
Bmr028_1447	Hmm . The first time I heard that , I I thought , you know , the same thing ; Thank you , Andreas . ; and I guess you ju after a while it becomes almost a It 's a bu bit of a a humbling thing when somebody says that . ; It 's p it it really is part of the jargon .
Bmr002_1183	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; there ; OK .
Bed015_311	I ; In fact , these are , um , ; as long as as Mark isn't around , these are form constraints . ; So a nominal expression is uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic .
Bmr016_1116	I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt ; Yeah ? ; you could could I just back up a little bit ; Sure , please ,
Bed003_720	Right ? ; If you say that 's more their in general what their background is . ; Yeah , ; I think this context node is a bit of a
Bro022_329	Yeah . ; Huh . ; I don't know . ; If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .
Bmr029_678	So , we need to run ? ; OK . ; Well , once we have the new , uh ; Well , once I do that , uh , second experiment , we 'll have the , um , files ,
Btr002_146	Well this was ; OK , so it should have been " the quals w the the quals slides will be fine " . ; This is Jerry Feldman . ; And , uh , instead it was transcribed with " the " and then an uncertain syllable " the the " and then " all the slides will be fine " .
Bro018_576	Mm - hmm . ; and then it finds the optimal separating plane , um between these two different um classes , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1362	or somebody 's gonna wanna make a change somehow . ; So we need to have some mechanism for , um , handling changes in the future . ; I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it , ; which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts .
Bmr022_628	which are the , you know , function words , ; the common words . ; Well , actually , you know , there 's an even easier way . ; We don't really need a beep model .
Bmr024_551	Right . ; Actually actually , w w the the We do this ; At the beginning . ; I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea .
Bro011_154	Well ; in in uh the other ; Yeah ; I don't know what happened really , but
Bmr028_218	Right . ; Yeah . ; Go wrong ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_2008	Oh , yeah . ; because there are like eight people talking to me all at once " . ; I 'm like , " Wow " . ; How about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers i in one meeting .
Buw001_972	So , I I think that this is gonna be useful . ; So if we record data I will definitely ask for it . ; So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? ; Yeah .
Bed002_1005	All these ; So ; So , like , the question is how what features can like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ? ; Right .
Bro021_447	Well . ; Uh , that 's that 's the other thing . ; W w if if ; I mean , without noise compensation certainly C - zero is better than log energy .
Bed011_525	Good luck . ; Yeah . ; Well , um , these are all f people off campus s from campus so far , ; Yeah .
Bro004_506	Mmm . ; Then you have uh MF , MS and ME ; which are for French , Spanish and English . ; And ,
Bed006_1459	Well ; you know and and and it after some iterations we may just do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I would just like to ask um like , if it could happen for next time ,
Bmr029_741	which is the , uh the Macrophone training . ; Right , ; an and ; So so , Andreas , um ,
Bro011_466	The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since ; I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it um ; the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables ; rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone .
Bmr006_28	It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , ; but um , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . ; So , I th I think I think we should start doing that . ; Um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting .
Bed015_908	Mm - hmm . ; not Nancy . " ; Hmm . ; So that 's focuses on John .
Bdb001_537	um , ; It 's almost the same . ; it 's yeah , close enough that ; The the the the point is with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information .
Bro023_1208	but , um ; Maybe . ; Could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction ? ; Yeah ,
Bro017_1221	Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways . ; Hmm ! ; u s And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use . ; Just uh
Bmr022_35	And that 's exactly what I was afraid of . ; And I went in , and more or less by hand , corrected it , by loading it ; I wrote a script that will convert it to the multi the Channeltrans format , looked at it in in Channeltrans and found the places where it got a unsynchronized , ; and then either
Bro028_464	Yeah . ; That 's what I was thinking by doing this es experiment , ; like ; Yeah .
Bro023_805	Yeah , ; th that 's that 's the only thing that I could think of why why it 's giving improvement on the mel . ; And , yep . ; So that 's it .
Bmr001_773	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro004_790	Nnn Uh It 's ; Almost . ; But I mean it it it does give a distribution . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_120	A actually , wait a minute , ; Although on ; Yeah . ; shouldn't it be the other way around ?
Bed003_1721	Isn't that what it is ? ; It 's uh ; yes w we we would like to test the wizard , ; but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic
Bsr001_899	It 's , uh , ; Yeah , he had he got very good results . ; you do get eh , like in an interview , uh , nice long segments ; Right .
Bmr024_1584	I dunno . ; Yeah . ; Oh , you don't . ; OK .
Bed014_1408	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And , uh ; Well it definitely makes the problem easier . ; I 'm I 'm in favor of that .
Bro017_334	You need at least two , basically . ; You need some relative , relative relation . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro014_1382	Yeah . ; and it 's not not enough to to have this kind of neat things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1336	could fill that . ; So there are a couple things where I like , " oh , I 'm not sure if I wanted to have it there ; Well that 's ; or " Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed .
Bro021_332	Mmm . ; Oh , yeah . ; A third thing is that , um , I play a little bit with the , um finding what was different between , um , ; And there were a couple of differences ,
Bed008_144	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Welcome . ; Or cheapness .
Bmr014_375	I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . ; OK . ; OK , and the transcribers h ; I , uh , don't have the exact numbers ,
Bsr001_2493	Well I I don't have any of the print outs . ; OK . ; I I print them out a a as I need them . ; So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here
Bro028_707	So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities , ; because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log . ; So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_884	OK . ; This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs ; Oh . ; Right .
Bmr028_607	I I 'm not too afraid ab about that as ; w when there when there would be something some background speech or something there wo there would be a a chunk in another channel , ; Oh , I see . Then Oh , I see . OK . ; Yeah . I think it 's better .
Bro019_1650	O K . ; So , uh , ; yeah , you 're going back today ; and then back in a week I guess ,
Btr001_1489	y OK . ; Huh . ; Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where there 'd be a misunderstanding about like ; like
Bmr009_1597	Oh . ; So . This one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro003_711	you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ? ; Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra , ; Yeah databases . ; Yeah .
Bro023_236	but if you had could have a system where , before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves , verbally . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1150	Well , see , i oc ; You were doing some something that was ; So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . ; You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved .
Bro011_637	and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own ; um It doesn't require its own training data , ; Mm - hmm . ; it just shares that state .
Bed011_105	Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace ; and um and they have a map . ; Hmm . ; Like this .
Bed005_267	Oh . ; " this " and " see " are not optional . ; " Want I like " is all maybe in there , ; but may also not be in there .
Bro017_457	next meeting is in June . ; Hmm . ; And uh uh but like getting get together . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr022_176	wouldn't that be ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , very low . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_737	And so , once we have some some of yours , ; OK . ; Yeah I 'm working on it . ; and @ @ we 'll move on .
Bmr006_1161	But I suppose ; Are probably better , yep . ; Yeah , yeah yeah , ; I I I will put eh the energy here .
Bro024_372	And in that case you probably don't wanna have it be endless because you wanna have some sort of it 's it 's not a question of how long do you think it 's you can get an approximation to a stationary something , given that it 's not really stationary . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bsr001_2593	give us digit strings . " ; Digit strings , ; That 's right . ; yeah .
Bmr012_777	Right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us . ; so ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro026_645	There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this ; and and ; Is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , ; or ho how important is this to the overall ?
Buw001_595	technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes . ; Yeah . ; The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every ; Yeah .
Buw001_490	So now we have five hours of meetings ; and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? " ; Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . ; I 'd have to get started someplace .
Bmr019_1924	W we want we want ; so that you don't get confused , I guess . ; we want it synchronized . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1232	Here . ; They should be more close . ; Ah , no . ; This is this ?
Bro023_843	which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , doing just this , uh , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , um , t doesn't yield any improvement
Bmr016_1732	Yeah . ; Right . ; And then , following that is " QUAL TCL " . ; Oh I see .
Bmr026_228	Ugh ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; We have
Bed016_456	Right . ; That 's horrible . ; Right . ; Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money .
Bmr023_432	and ; That would be great , yeah , to know that . ; There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . ; which one would be good .
Bro023_894	but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary , ; sometimes this estimation can be , uh , too small , ; so you don't subtract enough . ; But sometimes it can be too large also . If if the noise , uh , energy in this particular frequency band drops for some reason .
Bed008_421	so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three ; These three ? ; Yeah . ; Eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing .
Bro023_1433	Twenty frame ; Yeah . ; twenty four frames . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3347	Oh ! ; The only tags that you need to add , is ; So th uh , there 's like one exception that 's just microscopic , ; and that is , sometimes
Bro019_255	Yes . ; Yeah , ; there are um ; Right .
Btr002_1866	because I don't wanna put the transcriber through it again . ; Yes , that 's right . ; Let 's just ; But they actually had a big list of , like , things that people had transcribed
Bns001_1431	No , for y UMTS . ; But first of all , a generic system , ; but because you can have several mechanism ; really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description ,
Bro021_517	Sorry . ; So where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ? ; Oh . ; Um , the outputs of the net go into the standard , h um , ICSI hybrid , um , recognizer .
Bmr016_2115	the the p you know , the word " to " and the word y th " going to " and " to go to " ; those are two different " to 's " ; and so there 's no distinction there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_75	uh Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation . ; I will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad - hoc networks are , ; about the issues in media access control in wireless networks , ; also about routing in such kind of networks
Bed005_1285	So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that . ; Right . ; And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher , ; and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior .
Bmr016_210	OK . ; and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . ; Great . OK . ; Well let 's give it a try .
Bro010_287	I don't remember the exact numbers ; but ; Yeah . ; it was something like that .
Bro018_594	Yeah , that 's a good question . ; I ; That 's another way of doing it . ; yeah .
Bed005_64	and then ; And why don't you also copy Jane on it ? ; And , um , ; Are we Have we concurred that , uh , these these forms are sufficient for us , and necessary ?
Buw001_280	Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bro012_903	Right . ; But for the purposes of finding the speech ; And ; Yeah , but here
Btr001_1800	you probably do add things in those places where it 's where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it . ; Mm - hmm . ; You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe ? ; Yeah .
Bed006_1709	Yeah . ; and this action consists of all com complicated modules and image schemas and whatever . ; So . ; Yeah . And and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy
Bmr013_574	And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . ; There are some problems with the lapel mike . ; Of course . ; Yeah .
Bro018_674	I remember them doing it at some meeting , ; and and um I don't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to to try this ; and you know , it was the first time they tried it , ; so so the you know , the numbers were not incredibly good
Btr001_1887	I found this out . ; Is he really ? ; Yeah yeah yeah yeah . ; He has such a nice voice .
Bmr016_1384	Well , you just did . ; it 's not ; Well , ; Yeah .
Bed013_1420	and Thilo 's gonna do the instructing . ; Mmm . ; Also we 're getting a a person who just got fired uh , from her job . ; Uh a person from Oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once Fey leaves in August .
Bro018_1183	It 's trained on uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home , ; Uh - huh . ; um a bunch of different sources , ; some digits ,
Bmr026_336	Did they come in ? ; SUN - Blades . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1121	Oh . So tha that 's what I meant , ; it just some user like " meeting - root " or something . ; Oh , OK . ; I don't know .
Bed016_752	Yeah . ; But um . ; Uh , but OK . ; So in terms of the this
Bsr001_1966	I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @ should be working on these type of things . At least , ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_720	And we also ; There was some neat or , interesting cases , ; like there 's one meeting where , um , Jose 's giving a presentation ; and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed signal "
Bmr003_262	C Ds , ; Or t ; you know . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2811	A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something that , uh , will not really be heard . ; I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance , ; and people , uh , n I have to be conscious of that sometimes . ; Hmm !
Bro019_1353	Mm - hmm . ; Some small vocabulary tasks . ; Uh . ; So it was on PLP derived cepstral coefficients .
Bro016_1041	I I was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um , to be able to distinguish between , uh , phones and words and stuff . ; And um , ; once we ; we would figure out a set of these events that can be , you know , um , hand - labeled or or derived , uh , from h the hand - labeled phone targets .
Bmr012_1150	Well we could just hand around the lapel . ; Uh no ; Rather than get a ; no that 's
Bed016_161	Uh , yeah , I think so . ; OK . ; Yep . ; Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing .
Bed010_91	Why I had I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , ; mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb , ; You have to switch it on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_395	I don't consi Now I don't consider that possibility . ; and So maybe ; This is a s a general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the i ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1017	That 's ; Mm - hmm . ; I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1151	And it and it it , uh ; not infinite ; but a lot , and then compared to the number parameters ; and it it , uh it just doesn't do nearly as well .
Bsr001_1829	So what is the company ? ; so . ; I heard a " sh " . ; IBM .
Bmr020_1222	So , um ; OK , leave the mikes on , ; and just put them on the table . ; OK .
Bmr011_84	And we 'll undoubtedly think of other things . ; I had thought under my topic that I would mention ; the , uh , four items that I I , uh , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , ; which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans .
Bsr001_1706	You mean , uh , bu to combining the the posteriors on full band recognition like from from three different or four different mikes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Buw001_1642	How about if I just c ; Uh , Right now all I want ; I personally only want text data . ; I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now
Bmr006_348	But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , " Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , " well maybe you don't . ; Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . ; Yeah . ; For some of it .
Bro016_27	I don't really have , uh , anything new . ; Been working on Meeting Recorder stuff . ; So . ; OK .
Bro013_85	So it 's ; Yeah . ; I mean . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . ; We 've been playing a number of states
Bro027_1952	Yeah . ; so ; Yeah . ; It 's running
Bmr006_1338	Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro014_470	So it 's still the same same microphone in both cases , ; So ; Same microphone ; but
Bed015_465	and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery , ; whereas past is a very conventionalized one ; and we sort of know what it means ; but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to , you know , unload all the notation every time we see that it 's past tense .
Bed005_1263	Well , let me say something , guys , ; cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which is The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this .
Bmr016_436	I think it was numbers , ; but I 'm not sure . ; It it sort of sounded like a duet , or something . ; Yeah .
Bro014_418	half open , ; full open ? ; Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ? ; On what kind of roads ?
Bmr005_1300	If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ ; I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , ; but I think if it 's a real ; Why not ?
Bmr007_572	Yeah . ; Hostile takeovers . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_734	uh , you know ? ; A a a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , uh , a better set . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro023_269	Mm - hmm . ; um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said . ; And , uh , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_434	this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before ; Mm - hmm . ; but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_794	uh the close channel ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; and s channel one is the ; Yeah .
Bmr007_837	and unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's ; the problem is he does it in two passes , ; the first pass is to find candidate places to do a break . ; And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the the , uh one of the phone classes is silence .
Bro017_643	uh in the ; Oh . ; you know , just compress the whole vector . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1059	And everyone else is low , yeah . ; Yeah . ; you know , what I mean , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_151	Oh . ; That aspect . ; Yeah . ; And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .
Bmr005_674	Uh - huh . ; I I I think It 's it 's a good eh work , ; but ; but eh I think we need eh eh more information .
Bmr003_1844	We can have ; You wanna word that won't be recognized ? ; You see , cuz uh , cuz ; Exactly .
Bmr031_1246	hopefully by the twentieth , the twenty - third . ; Twentieth . ; The twentieth ! ; Yeah . We 'll have it all straightened out .
Bmr021_111	So , I mean , we could try another mike . ; But then we have the wiring issue , ; and So I I don't know what to do . What do ; what do people think ?
Btr002_853	but it was ; Yeah . ; I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time . ; Mmm .
Bmr020_137	but what our discussion yesterday , I really I I wanna submit one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Was this SmartKom message ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2025	Yeah , they 're referring to this or that and the other thing ; and you 're just going , " No , ; Yeah . ; I don't understand . "
Bmr020_1455	Yeah . ; So y you do a bunch of meetings , ; you listen to to a little bit here and there , ; Yeah .
Bro010_548	it 's based on this kind of method , ; this histogram method . ; Hmm . ; So you have a histogram .
Bro026_953	That it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . ; But it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . ; You know , however we do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_977	Well , I mean , my argument here is it 's it 's it 's the same thing as " Plato 's on the top shelf , " ; figuring that out is what this is about . ; Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree . ; I 'm con
Bro022_1026	So , in some cases s there are also ; Yeah . ; There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are . ; o
Bmr027_1367	Um . But , um , ; I don't know , ; I guess I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing . ; We have these meetings and and there 's the status reports .
Bmr031_1295	Yeah . Actually we had this ide from the last time that they were here , that it 'd be nice to have UW do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically ; Can I borrow a piece of paper ? ; since they can ramp up much ques quicker in the language modeling ; Thank you .
Bmr030_642	Wha - whatever you generate . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed . ; Were " shortened " .
Bed003_50	Mm - hmm . ; you know , because ; But if you really want to find out what it 's about you have to click on the little light bulb . ; Although I 've I 've never I don't know what the light bulb is for .
Bed008_487	Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? ; Well you could , ; that 's a that 's a choice . ; OK .
Bed003_529	Other syntactic information you mean ? ; Yeah . ; Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1280	It 's just a thought . ; Yeah , ; I can I will try to do that . ; Yeah .
Bed012_947	How 's that ? How it can be finite , again ? ; Nah , I can't think of a way it would be infinite . ; Well , you can come up with new constructions . ; Yeah . If the if your if your brain was totally non - deterministic , then perhaps there 's a way to get , uh , infin an infinite number of constructions that you 'd have to worry about .
Bed011_919	and we 're gonna start thinking a about uh what constructions we want to elicit . ; And then w go it may iterate on uh , further data collection to elicit ; D Do you mean Do you mean eliciting particular constructions ? ; Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about ? Semantically speaking , eh ?
Bmr014_13	Yeah . ; We didn't have a front - end meeting today . ; And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused . ; OK .
Bmr002_805	it 'll take me just a second here ; Well , I guess XML makes some amount of sense . ; I 'm not actually familiar with it ; but it seems to be the sort of thing that this would be good for .
Bro016_361	And we w we try to use the variance of the es difference between the FFT spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum . ; Yeah . ; Uh , also the another parameter is relates with the auto - correlation function . ; Uh - huh .
Bro016_160	part of what 's going on , um , is the , uh , the range of values . ; So , if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range , and taking the appropriate root . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_232	and ; Uh , but their noise estimation , ; um uh ; I mean , back on the second stream ,
Bmr003_1705	And that ; Yep . ; cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing ; Yep .
Bmr003_370	It would you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you turn off the turn off the air conditioning , ; Carbon monoxide poisoning ? ; Short meetings , ; that 's right .
Bmr027_1220	Cuz I think sounds like people are interested . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Definitely .
Bro005_1022	but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ? ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's that that seems like the the the real question . ; And if you know that
Bed011_754	Mm - hmm . ; Wow ; It seems like this would be really hard to guess . ; I mean , on the part of the system .
Bro025_194	Do do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted ? ; Mmm . ; Well , depending on its size ; Well , one question is , is it on the , um , server side or is it on the terminal side ?
Bmr001_810	I do I don't know the answer to that . ; I 'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for ; I don't know . ; Yeah Yeah , that 's true ,
Bed003_1312	Yeah ? ; meaning " It 's way out of my budget " ; um ; There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter ?
Bed009_389	I think . ; Hmm . ; Yes . ; So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,
Bns001_1737	It makes you things much more simple much more easier , ; Uh . ; uh , but is far far away , you know . ; Unless unless we speak about quality of service ,
Bmr013_594	So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , ; Right . ; so , that 's that 's great for for my purpose . ; And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references .
Btr001_66	but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated , ; Mm - hmm . ; once you learn what it is , and you can say , " OK I know what they meant by that " ; or " I know how to spell that now "
Bro014_866	How did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data ? ; We used , uh , TIMIT ; and we used canonical mappings between the phones ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1834	Wow . ; To Andreas , the idea is is good . s To eat here . ; Well ; Mmm .
Bsr001_1260	cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro018_43	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_2243	but y come come back to me . ; For the moment . ; Pass . ; I think I think " pass " is socially acceptable .
Bmr031_195	I mean ; Right . ; Well , we did do some training on digits ; That 's right .
Bmr011_1586	That 's funny . ; So h it 's , you know , t ; Alright . ; And so that would make sense .
Bed015_675	Right . ; So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it . ; It might be ; it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require
Bro005_986	and the other is multi - band uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . ; Mm - hmm . ; So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could could could help . ; Yeah , if you i i It 's interesting thought
Buw001_1024	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Ru ; But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it ,
Bro022_249	So ; so it 's these are just microphone ; this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . ; Oh .
Bro023_468	which is more like a musical noise or something . ; And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like , ; um ; So , I still don't have the word error rate .
Bmr028_1322	So ; Yeah . ; I mean , I don't know how you get them into the vocabulary , ; but it would seem @ @
Bns003_345	health insurances ; So , health insurance is k something I can only say for German people . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; So maybe
Bed002_347	" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . ; The crude , undifferentiated parse . ; Interpreted input . ; We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries .
Bmr027_1358	just by looking at at papers and status reports . ; Hmm . ; I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . ; Uh , so I can grab stuff there .
Bro024_94	I I don't think it it 's just for any mismatch you take a hit . ; Yeah . ; i In some cases it might be u better to have a mismatch . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1522	but I couldn't go anywhere . ; But um . ; Hmm . ; I thought " well if I only allow "
Bmr010_892	So the so the the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone , ; um , that is for that . ; Right . So in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone . ; Yeah .
Bro008_302	OK . ; Eh ; It 's a novel idea . ; Look at the data .
Bmr012_315	Where where they weren't monotonic . ; yeah , I mean ; right ? ; There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame .
Bro024_311	right ? ; right . ; OK , ; so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker .
Bro022_1042	But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . ; And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . ; So there are three time constants that I have . ; So , I 'm just playing around .
Bro011_457	Right . ; So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bro007_62	Oh let 's focus on them then ; so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ? ; For the f the f first yellow line you mean ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_547	Mmm . ; Right . ; and also , um , it varying when they change their hea w head position . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_353	Well , yeah . ; I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . ; And at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on . ; At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords
Bro025_293	Oh . ; With the rank ordering ? ; I 'm sorry . ; The the the smoothing the m the the filtering of the probabilities .
Bro026_813	Yeah . ; And there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people . ; So just you can see all this mails in the ISIP web site ; OK .
Buw001_1975	um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened . ; But I wonder if Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? ; So either by rules of participation , or whatever . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed006_206	Do it . ; That 's ; Yeah . ; OK ,
Bed011_177	just Not all people can do that . ; So , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level Um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here ; let 's go to our favorite endpoint one ; is again more or less we have um
Bmr014_886	I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped . ; And and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . ; I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1912	Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this ? ; Or do you need to g do people need to leave . ; I don't wanna keep you longer than ; Mm - mmm .
Bmr001_11	You 're going to sit there ? ; Is that alright ? ; Yeah , OK , ; maybe I 'll put this thing here then .
Bns003_80	So you just have to ; And ; Why you are laughing ? ; I ju
Bed002_315	very important , ; and um , that I 've completely forgot that when we talked . ; This is of course a crucial factor , " what type of object is it ? " ; So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of .
Bed015_1537	So so again , this uh , this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff ; and t because you know , " Fred said that Mary said " , and whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro021_244	Mm - hmm . ; Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database . ; Mm - hmm . ; If if you compare th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n n n the MFCC are not very different .
Bmr016_1448	Oh . ; or the " UH " , " EH " , " AH " were all the same . ; And then , we have this additional non - native version of uh , like " eeh " . ; All the " EH " 's I 've seen have been like that .
Bed014_1153	Yeah . ; Anyway , uh , so let 's let 's for the moment call it that until we think of something better . ; OK . ; And , yeah , we absolutely need to find
Bmr003_1958	The question is what is what 's he looked at . ; That 's true . ; Which one do you use Jim ? ; I use something called Trellix .
Bmr012_607	which I would which well n n n n ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So the real value of the database is these ? ; Yeah , abso
Bro016_137	Alright . ; OK . ; Uh . ; I probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model .
Btr001_2156	if it happened in certain occasions and whatever , ; and I never really got around to it , ; but . ; Do you people
Buw001_2058	What what do they ; And there was a big division , ; so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . ; Yeah .
Bro017_38	Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector . ; Right . ; And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " . ; Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either ,
Buw001_1017	Hmm . ; It 's like this is not what we meant to research . ; Right , right . ; Oh .
Bmr022_967	How standard are these ? ; Works with this . ; I don't know . ; or some people might ,
Bed013_1381	in the literature there 's " bank " ; and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we can say , well , that 's all nonsense . A ,
Buw001_1898	Yeah . ; He 's switching to other stuff again . ; Yeah . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . ; So , I 'll I 'll send him email .
Bed002_84	Well , what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . ; Right . ; Um , but not in the audio . ; OK .
Bmr026_465	Yep . ; At least . ; There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button . ; Just press Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " " this week " .
Bro019_766	so I ; I I you know , ; I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars , ; and and you would have something that was roughly similar
Bmr019_1773	Oh . ; Nice . ; uh . ; I I hope if you need , eh , something , eh , from us in the future , I I will be at Spain , to you help ,
Bed015_163	Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for ; actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes . ; Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1214	And so I think you Yeah , I think you Did you ; I don't think I have ever done one from an external ; has there already been t ; I have .
Bro023_741	And that seems to be working . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that .
Bmr005_90	and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , ; and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? " ; And and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to " . ; Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ?
Buw001_2211	And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be ; because it depends on what your purpose is . ; So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . ; But that 's not really a specific fact .
Bsr001_1287	So so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ? ; Uh um . ; And it ; I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on "
Bmr028_1509	And is used ; This is interesting what what Adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other , uh , dimensions . ; Well , the example I was thinking of , also , was this w thing that that Herve and and Hynek and I made about , uh , increasing the error rate . ; And , so we we did a number of papers , and talks , and so forth about , uh w uh , i the the virtues of increasing the error rate .
Bed015_1779	It 's about ; Oh , that in that use of " about " , yeah . ; clever . ; Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge .
Bmr024_1282	Uh - huh . ; because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features . ; No no . ; I I remember that .
Bed008_776	never mind , ; not in the current ; No we have to enter the park . ; OK .
Bmr001_28	It 's got two to both channels . ; Oh , hang on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , it is at the moment .
Bed011_759	I mean you 're you 're talking about rather than having the user decide this you 're supposed t we 're supposed to figure it out ? ; w well ; Th - the user can always s say it , but it 's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important . ; Overrider
Bmr023_288	Our side is quick . ; I mean , I I don't know . How long does your ? ; It should @ @ be finished today or something . Yeah . ; Well , I meant the overall thing .
Bed010_821	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; um So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . ; So we gotta do all this .
Bro026_84	I I would have to ; So w when you came in from Belgian Belgium , using SSH , uh , was it asking you for your own password into ICSI ? ; So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ? ; Right .
Bmr026_1192	At least a couple thousand hidden units . ; I mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more
Bmr020_853	right ? ; Yeah . ; Hey mon hafta booga . ; OK .
Bro027_238	Uh , so , um , ; that , uh that seemed to be ; So , if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters , and if you , um , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , um , the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation . And and not bother with with this acoustic , uh , processing . ; But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing .
Bmr019_266	Now , eh , does ; one one issue ; You might wanna move the mike down a little bit . ; one issue with with that is that um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization
Bro028_370	Yeah , it 's one percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; He 's trying to remove the pitch information ; Oh , oh . OK ,
Bmr002_358	Play . ; and type what I know ; Yeah . ; and then and then at the end do a breeze through to be sure that everything 's correct .
Bmr016_1652	Where 's that ? ; So th ; Yep . ; On the page two of acronyms .
Bmr008_1365	OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help . ; Yeah ? ; You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something , uh that that there would be more of a distinction . ; Nnn .
Bsr001_992	Uh , but I but I 've seen debates where ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_95	cuz I think it 's sort of safe , ; cuz people can people can say their acronyms really fast ; Uh - huh . ; and I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said , it 's probably best to put them in parentheses
Bro028_488	Um . ; So it 's ; you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off . ; On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something .
Bmr023_191	Yeah . ; so we should just get together and ; Yeah . ; And even The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good
Bed016_936	You mean the s ; You mean " the steak wants to pay " ? ; N no not that one , ; that 's that 's a the sort of background .
Bmr031_279	Mm - hmm . ; And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there . ; Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their backchannels ; Yeah .
Bns001_827	So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh " network " . ; No , I believe " network " is , if you see it really from from the IP protocol suite , is then layer one , in principle , up t including layer four , ; despite the fact that layer four is only residing , normally , in the end system and in the gateways . ; But are there " network applications " , then ?
Bmr003_2192	Oh , I didn't understand ; That being the wiring box . ; Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal . ; Oh , I see ,
Bmr006_1357	Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? ; Interesting .
Bmr014_821	Good . ; No . ; For security ? ; Yeah , OK good .
Btr001_989	So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that , ; and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ? ; I mean , maybe " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK " ; and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either ,
Bmr020_1556	uh , more amount of ; Yeah well , the detector says there is speech , ; but there is none . ; So that that can be a lot when when it 's really a breathy channel .
Bed005_426	h ; cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML . ; Yep . ; Uh - huh !
Bro012_1523	But um . ; Hmm . ; I thought " well if I only allow " ; Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis .
Bmr012_205	Well , I mean , they ; Well it was interesting , ; but I was able to can transcribe ; I don't remember when it is .
Bro017_769	Oop . ; The spread , ; Sorry . ; right .
Bro003_1102	Eight y ; but ; Is that just separate nets for each language then combined , ; Necessary to put in .
Bmr031_956	Oh . ; Are they like these , ; Yeah , they 're like those . ; right ?
Bed016_1107	Yeah . ; Ah ! ; " I wanna go see the Van Gogh . " ; Oh geez .
Bro027_583	Yeah . ; No , I mean , the ; after the noise part , the forty the the other hundred and eighty ; Well , I mean ,
Bmr012_1065	no they 'll just charge us more , ; so it 's this ; Mmm . ; So so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?
Bmr021_768	Right . But in what we 've done so far , because we didn't have any special provision for C - zero , we just treat it as as any of the other features , ; we 've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side . ; So um since both SRI and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C - zero that 's presumably , you know , someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better . ; Um , so that 's another difference ,
Bmr003_1114	and it takes about ten times real time . ; I see . ; So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do . ; Yeah .
Bed015_172	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I don't know what , uh , term we want to use ; but we don't want to ; Yeah , uh , there was one time when when Hans explained why " constraints " was a misleading word for him .
Bro028_181	Mmm . ; Hmm . ; Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing , I I I think , the number of insertions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1772	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; The the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . ; The data we get from Munich is very command line ,
Bmr020_373	but still we we Uh , Don did some ha hand - checking ; and and we think that based on that , we think that the results are you know , valid , ; although of course , some error is gonna be in there . ; But basically what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost uh , the level of the non - overlapped speech .
Bed004_344	Um , you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever , ; Right . ; or they were hurried . ; That 's kind of related to that .
Bed005_1167	What ? ; I if it 's a a a discar Discourse Initial Phrase , we will have nothing in the discourse history . ; So , if if we ever want to wonder what was mention ; Oh
Bmr007_103	So it 's like , you know , rather , lively discussion there . ; What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? ; Oh , ; th That 's the per cent .
Bmr026_1194	Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more ; but it it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand . ; Mmm .
Bro018_799	but I was gonna ask about the the um changes to the data in comparing PLP and mel cepstrum for the SRI system . ; Uh . ; Well what I 've been ; " Changes to the data " ,
Bmr016_1936	And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now ; which is just well n n " NUMS " by itself ; " NUMS " , ; yeah .
Bed002_377	So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? ; Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? ; Is it , uh ; Well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it .
Bmr013_926	I dunno ; how long were ; you did one ? ; I saw a couple , around twenty seconds ,
Bed003_397	Then ; that would be whatever building they referred to . ; Prosody . ; Right .
Bro011_155	in in uh the other ; Yeah ; I don't know what happened really , but ; Yeah .
Bed016_331	and the rest is for airplanes . ; So X - schemas , then , I would like to do ; talk about the construction aspect ; and then at the end about our Bayes - net .
Bro013_76	But I guess the main point is the data because ; uh I am not sure . ; Our back - end is is fairly simple ; but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail
Bed016_388	that ho that whole th ; Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , ; OK , right . ; so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy ,
Bro017_1131	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_112	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr026_768	Um I jus So the latest result was that um ; um yot I tested the uh the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .
Bed010_25	OK . ; Um , the uh ; Oh , ; Am Spartacus . "
Bed015_342	Yeah . ; I think it 's fine . ; Right , n s ; you may be you may not be like everyone else in in Berkeley ,
Bro016_171	um , ; that has a similar effect ; because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidates from the acoustic model ; Oh ,
Bmr027_607	So it 's unusual that that they , uh ; So my original impression was that that was sufficient , ; that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden . ; Yeah .
Bns002_797	So , this should be something like ; uh ; thirty meters per second . ; OK ?
Bmr025_799	and so that means synchronizing the time ; You know you want it pretty close ; Mm - hmm . ; and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery
Bmr015_591	s So in s um ; So I 've switched to ; Start my new sentence . ; I I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the uh , tighter time bins for partly for use in Thilo 's work
Bmr018_1461	and and ; it has to be , though , someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing . ; Someone who actually does take notes , ; um , I 'm very bad at note - taking .
Bro026_223	And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . ; And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . ; Uh , even that 's hard enough . ; And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category .
Bro028_750	Yeah . ; Gaussian mixture model . ; OK . ; It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals .
Btr001_2278	Hm - hmm . ; I think people end in " but " a lot too . ; And I feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_789	Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore . ; Yeah . ; So he he dislikes the term . ; Well , I I don't like the term either , so I have n i
Bmr022_1017	and , uh , have some wireless connection to it . ; And then the question is what is what does it look like , ; does it look like something that you you hold like this , ; or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm 's length th so that you can see some display ,
Bed008_681	Well , that that 's we can't do that , ; so we we 're gonna have to ; Yeah . ; but this is a good discussion ,
Bmr021_817	Why do you think the ICSI front - end is so much worse ? ; Good question . ; That 's fine . ; That seems really odd to me .
Bsr001_1983	Yeah , ; Yes . ; definitely . ; Yes .
Bmr020_1843	With ; with the laptop sound , ; or ? ; w If we have speech from the laptop should we just uh , excise that from what we send to IBM ,
Bro025_406	Yeah , we talked about that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Uh - huh . ; So we have no delta . And then
Bmr018_1268	Right . ; that 's good ! ; What did you say ? ; wh
Bed008_430	from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So for this decision it 's just uh true or false
Bmr007_1206	No , no . ; You can you know , you could make a m as long as you keep using the same beep , people could make a model of that beep , ; Hmm . ; Yep .
Bmr001_398	We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And then we then we cut it in half .
Bro016_300	Just take a look at it a little bit . ; OK . ; And we we we may just find that that we 're way off . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2044	Right . ; Right . That would argue for changing the other ones to be " digits " or something . ; Um , that way w if we make a mistake parsing , or something , we don't see the " point five " , ; or or it 's not there , then we
Bro028_898	And it would turn , you know , one thing into another . ; It 'd turn Wiener filtering into spectral subtraction , or whatever . ; But there 's other things that we 're not doing . ; So , we 're not making any use of pitch ,
Bro027_770	cuz it 's really , um I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , it 's still terri ; Yeah , even for a well - matched case it 's sixty percent error rate reduction ,
Bmr016_1859	Beep . ; Perfect . ; Oh there is something spelled out " BEEEEEEP " ; Yeah .
Bro012_748	I I forget the reason behind it . ; But it it 's um it 's the first six seconds or something of it ; and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in . ; So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think ,
Bmr015_460	to different kind of planes . ; So . Um . But , um . ; So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , ; or none of us are funded for ,
Bmr026_1247	It 'll be faster . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see .
Bmr031_88	I guess . We 've got the usual ; Well , because no one no one ever rep responded with any items . ; Yeah . ; So I have a couple of minor ones .
Bmr021_996	What would you like it to do when that happens ? ; Well , no , if if you um ; I mean obviously you always ; I mean , there 's never gonna be a signal from all the channels ,
Bro004_1300	But but uh ; Yeah . ; Just curious . ; How are we doing on the resources ?
Bed008_1548	Well , it will inspire me . ; Right , sure sure . ; Right . ; Yeah , sure .
Bed003_987	yeah . ; But uh , ; yeah . ; Maybe another thing that uh
Bmr009_360	but just simple case ; and the one that has the lot of data associated with it . ; Right . ; Cuz what if it 's the case and I don't think this is true
Bmr011_382	A little bit , ; I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bro010_358	Uh - huh . ; and to to change the contextual KLT for LDA . ; Change the what ? ; The contextual KLT .
Bmr023_310	You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . ; Yeah . ; I think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know . ; Right . Right .
Bsr001_166	They tend to clip . ; Hmm . ; That 's a nice user interface , Dan . ; That 's that 's really something .
Bmr022_775	But ; The other thing , too , is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you 're wearing , the fancy one , is actually somewhat better than ; It is . Yeah . ; So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference ,
Bed015_892	W uh , ; I 'm not sure about that . ; Or it might limit it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus . ; OK .
Bro010_873	or ; What what what are they looking at ? ; Um ; What are their inputs ?
Bed014_1341	when we 're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in in English or in German , in particular , whatever , that 's great , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things .
Bmr031_1223	You should have seen the one that got away . ; basically . His ; Y who Yeah , right . ; Whose result ?
Bed015_1681	Yeah , yeah . ; So that 's that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages .
Bed006_1593	whenever . ; But yeah . ; You are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion gets you anywhere in in your life then uh you 're free to c ; It 's fascinating .
Bro028_682	Yeah . ; But , what might get at something similar , it just occurred to me , is kind of an intermediate thing ; is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , um , uh , values that come out of the net , ; which are something like log probabilities ,
Bed011_596	I don't know . ; What is the uh the the English co uh um cognate if you want , for " Sankt Nimmerlandstag " ? ; Keine Ahnung ; Sort of " We 'll do it on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .
Bro010_3	OK , we 're on . ; OK , ; what are we talking about today ? ; I don't know .
Bmr003_2280	In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is . ; That cabinet can can go away . ; We can use that for for uh kindling or something . ; But if you can imagine what the right form factor is .
Bmr027_655	I was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this . ; Right . R Right . That 's true . ; Right . ; I mean , I I
Bmr003_1270	Yeah , that 's right . ; an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bmr027_1314	OK . ; So there 's another hundred gig . ; So . ; Alright . Great .
Bmr009_1036	But th if Midland ; Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess . ; I think a lot of people ; Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern .
Bmr019_712	those would be able to do that , ; Sorry . ; but the rest would be constrained . ; So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers .
Bro018_1129	f I think . ; Yeah . ; So why were you getting forty - one here ? ; Is this
Bed014_1218	Hmm ? ; In in logic , it 's it 's @ @ it 's actual Huh ? ; Mmm . ; Right . Let 's put a Skolem Skolem constant in ,
Bmr018_1644	Or done another language , or ; Yep . ; I mean , you so there 's papers on portability and rapid prototyping and blah - blah - blah , ; Yeah .
Bed016_308	e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story . ; I I wa I do wanna , um ; I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , ; um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works ,
Bdb001_1297	Time time times are ephemeral . ; Andreas was saying ; Yeah . ; what if they haven't notated with them , times ?
Bmr015_50	Right when you were in my office it arrived . ; OK , cuz I checked my mail . I didn't have anything . ; So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? ; I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits .
Bmr028_1125	Well , we have to sort of check that out . ; subtract that from the original signal and you 're set . ; That 's ; OK .
Bro027_1037	The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features . ; because i ; I mean , if you 're only using h ; And generally , i it s allows you to transmit like , fifteen , uh , cepstrum .
Bed003_762	right , ; and then just marginalizes ; Yep . ; But uh We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd
Bro005_1161	and noise type ; uh , and uh , uh , channel characteristic , ; sort of all over the map . ; A bunch of different dimensions .
Bmr016_1410	Yeah . ; Arg . ; It does . ; Arg arg - max , arg - min ,
Btr002_2320	Mm - hmm . ; I I would say that it 's both I would say that both Jerry and Morgan do this . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it ,
Bed015_1534	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So so again , this uh , this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff
Bmr007_620	Mm - hmm . ; Uh ; Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_713	Oh , the short amount of time thing , right . ; So ; so we you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the HLT paper ; and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis ,
Bed011_599	Sort of " We 'll do it on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; OK .
Bed010_804	This is more proximal - distal . ; Yeah uh exactly . ; So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . ; S
Bro005_641	mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . ; So I take exactly the same configurations , ; seven bands with nine frames of context , ; and we just train on TIMIT ,
Bro019_435	Yeah , ; I see . ; So , ; I mean clearly they 're interact .
Bns002_1159	So , these are more or less uh some open problems , ; and uh well just a quick comment about probably ; all of use are now aware of the availability of this eh standard the I - triple - E eight hundred and two point eleven ; uh in fact it is it is powering you know , uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area .
Bro024_1701	because if you smooth then y you kind of distort the speech . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr031_808	Yeah . The the pie chart shows actually m meetings that are , ; uh ; it combines the categories of , you know , " currently in " ; Oh ! Well , I 've got it right there , I think .
Bed011_1063	so you can do f you know , f f uh have a complete story ov of s of some piece of dialogue . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's gonna be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or or or something like that . ; Yeah .
Bed013_640	I 'm flying to Sicily next in a w two weeks from now , ; Oh , lucky you . ; w and a week of business in Germany . ; I should mention that for you .
Bmr002_1308	Are you certain ? ; Lea ? ; No . ; The claim that uh words that get stressed are easier to recognize .
Bmr027_683	By the way , has has Jeremy signed the form ? ; I hadn't thought about that . ; OK . ; That for every meeting
Bmr003_1974	I think both . ; I think mostly internal . ; Mostly in house . ; That 's right .
Bed003_1478	One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that ; Yeah . ; and sort of ; Well . You seem to know better than we do so .
Bmr009_1047	I think originally it was North Northwest ; Northwest ? ; Yeah . ; But
Bmr002_1030	but they uh they show up in resources . ; So , Um , we 'll start with " Transcriber " ; and if it looks like that 's not gonna do what we need , we 'll move on to the Mississippi State ; and if it doesn't look like that 's going to work , we 'll look at something else .
Bro021_1054	Capital Y . ; X . X . ; This is X , inside . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_807	So . ; Yeah . We get twelve of those , ; huh ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2713	Yes , ; mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bro015_177	But they didn't do anything with the phase , and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way . ; So I 'm I 'm going to start thinking about um ways that the ph that the phase could be used . ; Um . ; Si - if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive .
Bed006_1350	How do I how do I come at this question ? ; Um . ; I just don't see why you would ; I mean does th
Bro017_1245	uh some amount of money , not much . ; Not much I can say on a microphone . ; Much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work . ; And they wanted uh to to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment
Bmr003_2004	No . ; therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing " . ; But I think the point is to try and be coherent and make it a nice presentation . ; Right .
Bro003_587	As opposed to the ICSI phone set ? ; Oh , ; you mean why map the sixty - one to the fifty - six ? ; Yeah .
Bmr014_938	Well , but ; Only if they want it . ; what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure . ; No , no , no .
Bmr014_1111	I don't think so . ; and I uh it 's uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . ; Ah . ; Fine .
Buw001_1991	That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , ; OK . ; cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1605	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; It 's just a matter of of work . ; So somebody will be playing the recognizer
Bed002_442	But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call . ; Oh yeah . ; You want the you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , ; but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time ,
Bro005_147	But when ; Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy . ; w Yeah , this Yeah , this number recognition acc ; So it 's not the Again we switch to another
Buw001_925	I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . ; Yeah . ; It will ; Right .
Bro027_1369	Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , I 've been wondering about something .
Bmr001_728	Yeah . ; Um , we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones ; Um , I had another question briefly about transcription . ; OK .
Bdb001_981	but ; I mean , th the reason I like P - file is I 'm already familiar with it , ; we have expertise here , ; and so if we pick something else , there 's the learning - curve problem .
Bmr025_63	As soon as ; I mean , these are ; They 're the IBM set . ; It 's this one .
Bro021_185	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; and ; Actually it was not a threshold ,
Bmr024_1633	Alright . ; not between ; And , uh , since we 're in a hurry , we were just gonna read everyone all at once . ; So , if you sorta plug your ears and read
Bmr016_1306	which could well mean that it occurred separately and following , ; or , you know , including some of the utterances to the left . ; Haven't been awfully precise about that , ; but I have here ,
Bro024_1697	Then I I would need to find a way to like smooth less also when there is high energy . ; Cuz I noticed that it it helps a little bit to s like smooth more during low energy portions and less during speech , ; Yes , ; y
Bed009_849	Mm - hmm . ; There is this this one that they did at SRI some years ago ; Fastus ? ; um
Bro016_890	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and ; And , uh , sometimes , you know , there 's enough evidence for something to work
Bmr013_724	So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , uh , to , providing tighter time bands ? ; I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . ; Wow , interesting . ; That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it .
Bed015_543	They 're real , right . ; and the " would " sort of it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ? ; I see right . ; We 're not saying What 's hypothetical about this world .
Bmr019_1345	but ; By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may you may feel , ; but the the , uh the morning meeting folks actually have an an extra month or so . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_227	So four four minutes all together with none none . ; Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ? ; But it w ; Yes , uh - huh .
Bmr020_1370	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know , ; I I think I 'm I 'm really tending towards
Bmr016_2280	OK . ; So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , ; but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_443	We 'd have the summary nodes like ; where the things were I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or some other ; Yeah . ; So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally
Bmr016_1999	So there wouldn't be something like ; OK . ; i if somebody said something like , " Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . " and then started reading that would be on a separate line ? ; Yes .
Bmr019_1832	Um . ; Oh , thanks , Jose . ; Wow . ; To Andreas , the idea is is good . s To eat here .
Bed015_1070	So , um , ; uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . ; I almost listed " discourse status " as a slot where you could say it 's active . ; You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible .
Bed008_1526	OK . ; OK . ; O OK . ; OK .
Bed016_396	yeah , but I also have stuff you trash you left over , ; OK . ; your quals and your triple - AI . ; The quals w the the the quals slides would be fine .
Bro012_695	because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices . ; But not of reverberation . ; Yeah . ; A boom .
Bns002_1372	and I currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic uh , within the I T ; Do you have certain kind of experience or do you know certain activities uh , in that area ? ; Nnn , no to both q to both questions . ; OK .
Bro003_1021	you don't wanna , ; uh ; Let 's see , ; seven choose two would be , uh , twenty - one different combinations .
Bro004_761	We want to have features ; uh well , um . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is
Bmr018_845	Thilo 's will . But . ; and we don't really know , ; Well it 's a merging problem . ; I mean ,
Bed013_754	I mean the conference may be cognitive neural , ; doesn't mean that every paper has to be both . ; Yeah , and you can you can just point to the to the literature , ; Mmm .
Btr002_2891	Yeah . ; Right . ; And so I did an analysis ; and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate
Bro027_1486	so that we can you know , show a clear path . ; Right . ; You know , that you have it without it , ; then you have the LDA ,
Bmr018_1660	so so these , I mean th the in the in the speech side , the thing that @ @ always occurs to me is that if you ; if you uh ; one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred , ; and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter ,
Bns003_868	It 's No , active ? ; But it 's sort of active because they have these program statements . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro025_503	Mm - hmm . ; That was I I had written that down there . ; Um ; So , we , uh actually I did the first experiment .
Bmr027_1031	So the transcriber was right . ; S ; You know , she was uncertain about that . ; OK .
Bro005_378	you think . ; So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1007	You don't have to do that . ; There 's like an XML format for Bayes - nets . ; Is it XML ? ; The - there is one .
Btr001_1665	Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Well , i it 's a judgment call . ; And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . "
Bed015_416	OK . ; So , uh , the the mental space thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , obviously , construal is a b is a b is a big component of that
Bro024_755	Yes . ; Stephane also has the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right ? ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1526	Right . ; Twenty percent relative gain . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1798	i This has caused me to wonder . ; So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've where they have like " dot dot 's " cuz it 's segments they didn't hear , that that you add u ; you probably do add things in those places where it 's where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_712	Mm - hmm . ; Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay say is " Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it , ; and now list the ones in preschool ; and now list the ones in first grade
Bed009_834	I I can give you the names of the people who do it there . ; But um . ; Then there is of course more ways of parsing things . ; Of course .
Bro004_712	OK . ; So basically what I expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down ; but perhaps not not so much ; Right .
Bro004_1248	but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand ; Yeah . ; sorry ; epsilon random variable in or something .
Bed003_1757	but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard , ; and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe . ; So so if if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1321	I think we can ha ; Yeah . ; bec b Nah ; Right .
Bed013_399	Might be more interesting to do something like let 's assume um , we 're right , ; we have as Jerry calls it , a delusion of adequacy , ; and take a " where is X " sentence , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1616	So , um , maybe when I get back there 'll be some some mail from her . ; OK . ; So , I 'll make a ; I 'm looking forward to seeing your representation .
Bmr026_26	Um well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . ; OK . ; For IBM , yeah . ; OK .
Bro028_739	uh , uh , unfortunately , like I say , I don't know the analytic solution to this ; cuz what we really want to do is change the scale of the likelihoods , ; not the cha not the scale of the the observations . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_214	Um , after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features . ; Right . ; And then those features are not now currently transformed by the neural net . ; And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features ,
Bmr002_1254	which is um I see it as sort of in - between um these fields ; because a lot of the time when people do rich um intonational and and stress - oriented transcription they don't have the digital record at the same time ; and the don't have it time - aligned . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1426	Right . ; We could have like , you know , some periodic meetings , ; Mmm . ; and like , uh ,
Bed010_1104	So we 'll do that . ; Great . ; Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing ; because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa
Bed003_357	OK . ; One , uh Uh . Um , ; anything else you want to say Bhaskara ? ; Um .
Bed009_518	take a taxi . ; OK . ; And the language end doesn't know that . ; OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine .
Bro007_71	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um ; Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .
Bmr020_271	so ; it just says that it 's a bi bell curve , and that , you have something that has a nice range , in your sampling . ; Yeah . ; So there are slight
Bmr016_115	don't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits . ; I agree . ; Um , ; and it seems like that might be better for you guys
Bmr019_785	or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers . ; Um , and then use that as a reference ; and tune the parameters of the of the model , uh , to op to get the best performance . ; Yeah .
Bed010_549	Um . ; So , where is this huge project ? ; It 's KLEIST . ; It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .
Bmr002_823	Mm - hmm . ; Do you know about the Stuttgart um people ? ; Because he 's saying if you represent ; I don't think so .
Bed003_318	Yeah . ; So we haven't uh , managed ; Like we don't have nodes for " discourse " and " parse " , ; although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net .
Bmr031_1098	and the end of that unit , like question - answer pair , could be a different speaker . ; That 's why we can't just annotate the transcripts , uh , one listening to one at a time . ; Mm - hmm . ; So so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it ,
Bmr021_110	Right . ; So , I mean , we could try another mike . ; But then we have the wiring issue , ; and So I I don't know what to do . What do
Bed011_960	No , not at all . ; OK . ; Dialogues . SmartKom ; OK .
Bmr021_505	Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah , so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet , ; but we should definitely double check on it . ; Yeah like like the same meeting shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording , looked , to the backup software , as if they had been written , you know , every single night , i for f you know , a week in a row ,
Bed008_735	Whatever . ; Then we can make a user state . ; What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . ; Uh or something , I don't know ,
Bmr020_97	Yeah , I guess you first you have to do the first one , ; Yeah . ; and then ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1048	Mmm . ; So if we wanna use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end ; and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . ; And that 's the other solution
Bro007_578	and and perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single KLT ; because we did not really test that ; removing all these KLT 's and putting one single KLT at the end . ; Uh - huh .
Bro016_763	The problem might be that the range of the MSG features is quite different than the range of the PLP or mel cepstrum . ; Mm - hmm . ; And you might wanna change that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1488	OK , leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time . ; Oh . ; That 's good to know . ; Turning off the microphone made it crash .
Bmr031_666	for distribution purposes it might make sense to split it by channel , uh , rather than by meetings . ; Yeah . ; So , you could distribute , like , only the near - field signals , uh , uh , uh , together for a bunch of meetings ; Yep . Absolutely .
Bro019_789	or ? ; I d ; I don't know . ; Well , it 's both both uh , cases can i
Bro003_339	But , no but , y you you pick up the phone , ; Yeah ? ; you talk on the phone , ; and it sends features out .
Bed003_1536	you know , we mentioned maybe if they talk about um , ; I don't know , ; entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . ; Hmm .
Bro017_324	Then but then now we are thinking a lot how to uh how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening ; This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition . ; Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands , ; but then oh uh uh
Bmr030_519	And that means That that 's more of a problem ; And all ; because y then you have to be there . ; Yeah .
Bed005_236	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; Sorry .
Bed017_373	or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , ; and and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you ; and and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more ; and and maybe I 'll just walk around the office
Bro024_1650	Yeah . ; I mean , you you have now several stages of smoothing , so to say . ; You start up . ; As far as I remember you you smooth somehow the envelope ,
Bns001_1353	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But ; Yeah .
Bro004_1220	by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band ; Uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . ; And they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . ; But they 've been looking at uh at these issues .
Bmr010_1201	I guess there 's another aspect , too , ; and I don't know ; uh , this this is very possibly a different , uh , topic . ; But , uh , just let me say with reference to this idea of , um , higher - order organization within meetings .
Bmr012_640	um yeah they 're pretty good ; so and and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth ; it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard ; so that 's good .
Bmr010_643	Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that . ; You couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things ? ; Yep . ; Huh !
Bro019_1509	it 's ; Well , um , it I don't think it directly relates . ; Um , well , so , I was helping a speech researcher named Pierre Divenyi ; and he 's int He wanted to um , look at um , how people respond to formant changes , I think .
Bro026_134	So . ; Yeah . ; Cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of ; Uh - huh .
Bmr001_50	Oh , I 'm number one . ; Absolutely . ; OK , which is a a l a lapel , ; in fact it 's sticking through my lapel .
Bro023_735	Like , you estimate the edge of square ; and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that doesn't seems to be improving by trying it on the first time .
Bmr025_225	All you need to do is say to Dan " gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf " and it 'll be done in a day . ; That 's true . ; Right ? ; Uh
Bed002_71	I mean , should I Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? ; Um , yeah . ; or ? ; No . There was there was Let 's see .
Bmr008_1530	Yeah . ; Is it ? ; That 'll also lessen the standard deviation . ; Here in the yeah it it 's a new new a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone .
Bdb001_369	Hmm ? ; if you have a two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna ; They 're they 're fair they 're quite large . ; And these are for ten - minute Switchboard conversations ,
Bro028_495	Yeah . ; Right . ; Well , yeah . These numbers , I mean . ; Mmm .
Bmr011_1433	I know that they recorded one meeting . ; Are they willing ? ; I think they 're open to it . ; I think , you know , all these things are
Bmr024_284	and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . ; OK . ; Well , I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , ; and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful ,
Bro014_717	I mean when we put the neural network . ; And with the current weighting I think it 's sh it will be better ; because the well - matched case is better . ; Mmm .
Bmr016_1619	I w I 'd like to standardize these down farther ; but , um , uh , ; uh , to me that sounds equivalent . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1200	Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better . ; Mm - hmm . ; But not much on the in the other cases . ; Yeah .
Btr002_385	Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of " twosome gruesome " , ; Good .
Bmr016_898	Yeah , if ; Yeah , l I mean over all our data , we we want to not downsample . ; fe ; You 'd you wanna not .
Bmr010_94	Here obviously it 's not . ; Yeah . ; And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , ; w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue ,
Bro027_205	week and a half . ; I I guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester ; but they 'll do it any time , huh ? ; They seem to be
Btr001_1565	Mm - hmm . ; you know , ; that somebody 's already done , ; Oh , how interesting .
Btr002_3407	Can we do digits ? ; Yeah . That 's fine . ; No ? ; Yeah .
Bro021_680	there is some some very silly bug somewhere . ; And , ugh ! ; I I mean , i uh , it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse . ; I was looking at the spectrograms that I got
Bmr024_752	Yeah . ; If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . ; O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . ; All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings .
Btr002_1191	pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one , whiche whichever it is . ; Oh , that 's true . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; I forgot about that one ,
Bmr002_977	There you go . ; I mean , no , I I ; I I love it when they ; But I 've never downloaded it .
Bmr030_344	I I gave you a c couple examples , ; Yeah , I m didn't have time to to look at that , ; and ; Hmm .
Bmr028_224	Just make shorter files . ; But it 's you know , it it 's ; That 's true . We could just subset it . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1106	I mean , you could just have in your scenario , " here are some extra few things that are true " , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? ; You 're but but it 's used for identification purposes .
Bdb001_176	I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for . ; Oh , no . ; You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , I 'd imagine . ; So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something .
Bed005_1329	I could have told them s so . ; Right . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1613	yeah , ; so so you ; yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network . ; Right ,
Bro004_974	There will probably be , ; Mu . ; yeah , ; one single KL to transform everything
Bro022_865	Uh . ; Yeah . ; So , your point is will be to u use whatever ; Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech .
Bmr006_606	Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh , Aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . ; One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE . ; SPINE . ; And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk .
Bns001_645	Ninety percent , maybe , or eighty percent . ; I kno I 'm not sure . ; But uh ; Yeah
Buw001_230	So . ; And ; There 's there 's another problem ; which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder .
Bed015_239	So basically now , um , this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , ; which is that " designates " isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now . ; Good . ; So we want s " designates " to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects
Bro019_410	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , it 's still not ; I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement .
Bro007_388	Yeah . ; Um ; Uh yeah well . ; Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ .
Bmr010_328	Yeah . ; And and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed006_75	I know Nancy . ; OK . ; I made that joke already , Nancy , sadly . ; What ?
Bed003_1046	Oh there we go . ; Maybe it was just ; Oh ! ; Oh .
Bro010_373	Uh , to change and use LDA discriminative . ; Yeah . ; But ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_1357	The problem is so much of their stuff is confidential . ; So . ; It would be very hard for them . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_515	So we had both the beginnings and ends of these ; uh so , the end of a filled pause ; and the end of a discourse marker . ; And we just eyeballed
Bed003_1326	If you want to see " The Magic Flute " or something . ; Yeah . ; Or maybe um , a famous restaurant . ; or , I don't know .
Bmr007_51	Uh , to uh uh , IBM . ; Oh . ; OK . ; They 're , you know
Bro019_1149	and you have the on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank . ; Mm - hmm . ; You can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal . ; Mmm .
Bmr030_730	If you need space just let me know . ; I have to create the p appropriate sub - directory . ; So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where we put a y a U doctor speech data , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_325	these things are correlated but they 're not perfect . ; Yeah . ; That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up , ; because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings .
Bmr007_784	Yeah . ; and it 's somewhat coincidental . ; I 'm sitting here so that I can run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something . ; Oh , no , you you just like to be in charge , that 's why you 're sitting
Bro025_192	But , um . ; But just conceptually , where does the neural net go ? ; Do do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted ? ; Mmm .
Bns002_743	but again we have to fix ; in order to be able to compare , we have to fix a given whatever , but a given uh maximum transmission range to compare . ; And , uh what we are doing is we are uh taking the advantage that we are u we have this RTS CTS dialogue , in advance , before sending the data , to uh agree with the receiver , the power level he is willing to get from us . ; OK ,
Bro007_598	when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell , ; so ; so in some ways he just got his payback , ; but uh again I I don't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group
Bro025_84	Mmm . ; Uh , and so , uh , th the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much . ; Uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . ; Um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering .
Bro023_63	So , um , ; why don't we why don't we start with you , Dave , ; Oh , OK . ; and then , um , we can go on .
Bmr015_416	that it was like four or five , ; wasn't it ? ; I I 'm ; Well they fund
Bmr031_1122	Oh , you mean display as in showing the waveform ? ; Yep . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bmr009_987	Is that what you would call yourself ? ; I don't know . ; Yeah . ; You know , I think if you 're talking if you 're thinking in terms of places , as opposed to names different peop names people have given to different ways of talking , I would think North Midwest , and South Midwest would be more common than saying Midland ,
Bmr023_546	Well , I forget how we end ; Right . I forget how we ended up on this , ; but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything ; and Adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio .
Bmr011_28	Yeah . ; OK , agenda item one , ; We went ; introduce Don .
Bro003_107	Bridge ; Once you get past the turnoff to the Bay Bridge . ; oh , the turnoff to the bridge ; Yeah .
Bmr022_826	And for some of the others , it 's their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Huh .
Bmr023_687	Yeah . ; and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , ; so where you know , if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . ; And there the prosodic features actually showed up
Bed008_567	underscore - E for entity , ; and we may change all this , ; but . ; Right .
Bro014_639	and and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_859	and so um . In fact , we actually don't have a a p ; Right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it 's worth trying .
Bmr011_1285	Yeah . ; right ? ; So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , ; Right .
Bed016_1052	Right . ; So you want a more exotic one version of that . ; Oh . ; Yeah . Yeah , right .
Bro024_915	the the log energy , the after the clean cleaning up . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they add a random random noise to it . ; To the just the energy , or to the mel uh , to the mel filter ?
Bro008_435	and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it . ; But , um , that was just sort of one try , ; right ? ; You just took one filter , threw it there ,
Bed016_539	cuz I 'll have to take a look . ; Um , but I I did not focus on that aspect ; but , um Ehhh , ; um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor .
Bmr028_1637	if there 's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all , it 'd be much better to go to another meeting , I think . ; I actually think that Thilo 's n in a in a k a You know , when you do the pre - segmenter and you and you run across troubles He he runs across s some of these that are ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Some of these things are captured by Yeah . Um , by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever
Bro024_156	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Btr001_156	Right ? ; Yeah . ; And so if if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine ; That 's right .
Bmr021_31	Me too . ; So do I . ; I prefer these , ; but I don't mind using those .
Bns002_627	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm getting more uh let 's say more gain than another . ; Yeah , ; And that 's true
Bmr011_181	OK . ; You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three . ; Mm - yeah . ; Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio ,
Bmr001_849	Mm - hmm . ; That 's a little bit of stuff to do . ; Right . ; Right ?
Bmr016_1277	And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . ; They always end . ; So it 's like they 're paired curly brackets . ; And then the third type right now , uh , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening .
Bmr011_1012	Yeah , ; so . ; Hmm . ; We 'll see .
Bro027_1580	So , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . ; So it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement , ; Mm - hmm . ; just like
Bro015_229	Yeah , apparently , um they had better results when they increased the number of states . ; From from eighteen to twenty , or ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1234	but ; I mean , s when I came up with the original data suggested data format based on the transcription graph , there 's capability of doing that sort of thing in there . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1518	We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned . ; Bless you . ; Bless you . ; Uh Anyway , but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available .
Bsr001_2166	couldn't he ? ; Mari or or or Katrin , or Jeff , or ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_634	I mean it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of ; once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . ; I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually . ; I mentioned that , b as a practical matter ,
Bed011_152	Well , there are these uh uh ; oh , I see , we have to ; Yeah , it 's tricky . ; We 'll let 's let we 'll do that off - line , OK .
Bro024_1195	Uh ; so . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed016_486	the ; the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , ; yeah . ; OK .
Bmr028_1667	Uh , like this o ; but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and , um , someone not talking . ; Just so it doesn't when the microphone 's dead , it doesn't put out zeros ? ; No .
Bmr005_109	and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have ; Mm - hmm . ; and see , is there anything to this at all ? ; Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .
Bro021_400	Yeah . ; Well , all th all three of you . ; I think we were gonna work with with this or this new system , ; or with
Bmr019_612	OK . ; I think that 's the key thing . ; And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there . ; OK . Alright .
Bmr011_426	Uh , so , um , ; Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , uh , microphone arrays . ; Yes . ; Um , is there
Bed003_1148	So but , e he doesn't use it . ; So in what sense has he updated it ? ; Well th you can either you ca or you can read both . ; Oh . I see .
Bns002_520	So this node should hear it before . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's right .
Bmr007_979	Yeah . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; and and so where do you get your thresholds from ?
Bed013_1187	Um ; It will be the same . ; So I think r in here we have " I 'll go there " , right ? ; Answers ?
Bsr001_2358	And so there is this prosodic thing which is which is indicating when whe the pauses between these digit strings . ; And then when they finish , the actual the whole sheet , there 's this nice , wonderful yeah , phrase @ @ . ; Mmm , mmm . ; Oh , yeah .
Btr001_2310	You can also end an utterance with , uh , " blah - blah - blah ; but I don't know " . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_122	Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . ; Because I think if you just say ; an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes You know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1268	Yeah . ; Yep . ; Oh yeah yeah . OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_637	but they 're they 're different meanings . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the closest thing
Bro004_156	Yeah . ; I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess . ; Uh , yeah . ; So um for uh TI - digits for ins
Bmr016_1424	OK . ; but I have found " EH " in native speakers too . ; But it 's mostly non - native ; S OK .
Bro028_304	Well , I mean , it 's ; eh ; There 's two problems there . ; I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation .
Bro027_593	Oh , it does ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; So in that case there isn't too much in parallel .
Bmr005_768	And you can ; Yeah , that 's his , uh ; We we we talked about that . ; s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,
Bro004_1393	Uh , probably the neural net ; cuz it 's probably it it 's it 's um ; Well , I I don't know . ; They both
Bns002_794	I will have to translate this , ; uh ; It shou should be something ipsh ; So , this should be something like
Bmr008_820	You know . ; Native - speaking New Yorkers , as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their You know . ; Oh yeah . ; mm - hmm
Bns002_1608	I have to call Adam , ; so ; So I suggest , @ @ now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break , tea , cake , whatever , @ @ will will be offered , ; and then we will have a we can have a discussion .
Bmr006_1582	I I 'm thinking too much . ; And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , ; Yeah , I was too . Yeah . ; and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial .
Bed016_1024	Yeah . ; Um . ; Um . ; I mean , there 's also things like I mean , s
Btr002_3006	and then there 's a pause , ; and then they start speaking , ; Mm - hmm . ; so then it 's really obvious , I can I can split it apart and it won't be any problem .
Bed005_1255	That 's the question . ; Well , in the beginning , we 'll write up a flat file . ; We know we have twenty object types ; Oh .
Bmr016_1810	You can correct it . ; but ; Yeah . ; but we need to make sure we have the mispel
Bmr002_273	Oh , you did . ; So , as part of this um project , we need to transcribe these meetings . ; um , to do training and test and so on . ; and , uh , so we need word transcripts and , uh , speaker change identification .
Bmr005_695	Do not mark any other events , ; Yeah . ; but only mark speaker ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_1281	And bindings to ontology items . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_715	So we 're gonna ; So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , ; whatever 's reasonable for us . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2159	Yeah . ; OK . ; I definitely think so . ; Yep . Mhh .
Bmr021_524	I don't think I don't think that 'll be ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So , maybe we should do that
Bed015_1549	Right . ; I I think , uh ; That 's ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1259	Going to see the kids . ; You you can keep it on . ; and that and that Dan worked on on that . ; So I thought that was really
Bro003_116	And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and it 's it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there .
Bed006_449	Then I suggest we move on to the to ; we have um uh the EDU Project , ; let me make one more general remark , has sort of two two side uh um actions , its um action items that we 're do dealing with , ; one is modifying the SmartKom parser and the other one is modifying the SmartKom natural language generation module .
Bmr008_1328	So , one is one is that um that uh we might wanna talk about normalization . ; I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use . ; Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done some kind of normalization ; and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible .
Bro017_739	Mm - hmm . ; All of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to C - one , you put them to zero . ; To the s you you know it . ; Yeah .
Bro010_606	esti some guess ; and and , uh , uh ; Yeah , but it ; It 's an interesting question .
Bmr001_359	Yeah . ; Five with wireless and four without , and four with wired . ; Yeah . ; Um , we don't have headsets though .
Bed008_754	would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . ; And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . ; Maybe um if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of um ; if we look at the uh the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions
Bed005_842	Yea - eh y Yeah , I guess so . ; Yes . ; And then here , y you are j uh , the person is getting information ; and they or may not be following some larger plan , you know , that we have to recognize or , you know , infer .
Bmr031_293	So if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them , we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus . ; Yeah . Well , we 'd ; And so , same issue . ; You know we just need to get someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it .
Bns001_1175	But the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too big ; to put all these big pieces to ; What do you mean by " put together " ? ; So that you really have a complete a complete scenario .
Bro003_1317	but you mean y You mean more classes . ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_553	so , it 's a different set . ; Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , ; I would change them to match . ; So instead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one .
Bro028_1113	I mean , y actually , you make me think a a very important point here is that , um , if we a again try to look at how is this different from what we 're already doing , uh , there 's a a , uh a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all , ; because , uh if you ignore the the selection part ; because we are going into a a very powerful , uh , nonlinearity ; that , uh , in fact is combining over time and frequency ,
Bro026_949	these categories . ; I guess ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't I don't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with the way I 've been looking at it .
Bsr001_1864	Morgan says ; Morgan says thumbs up . ; There we go . ; Right , right .
Bmr008_699	and then you could add a question . ; You know , would uh " among your peers " . ; You know . ; cuz he does make a good point about the region
Bmr011_957	Right . ; then they 'll switch between . ; Well I think that that might change if you wanted really fine time markings . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1328	how much we have anal I hope to have that for next time . ; Yeah , my my algorithm worked great actually on these , ; That 'd be interesting . ; but when you wear it like that or with the uh , lapel or if you have it very far from your face , that 's when it starts failing .
Bed005_1310	i ; Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , uh , the probabilities or whatever . ; th ; Yeah .
Bmr010_75	Yeah . ; Well , uh , I guess the work that 's been done on segmentation would be most ; I think that would be a good thing to start with . ; Yeah .
Bro003_662	Um ; and ; the last dimension happens to be ; Yeah and again
Bns002_262	One ; Yes , ; OK , ; this one .
Bmr027_588	I and and I they 're also so ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through
Bed009_197	And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project ; and we noticed that first of all what are ; I should 've brought some slides , ; but what our
Bed011_1142	I 'll be gone . ; Yeah . ; He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town . ; Sure , OK .
Bmr005_1096	but I but ; not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response , ; but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos . ; Um , a number of people have done this
Bed003_611	One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this . ; Yeah . ; That seems kind of redundant ; but .
Bmr024_786	Exactly . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , great .
Bmr018_1296	Yeah , so they were ; yep . ; which is the i interesting ; And cameras .
Bro004_485	It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline . ; Ah ! ; Ah , OK , OK . ; So this is word word error rate ,
Bns002_796	It shou should be something ipsh ; So , this should be something like ; uh ; thirty meters per second .
Bns002_1243	in the beginning , uh what w the ; I think that to put things in perspective , what we need to know is what Bluetooth is and what Bluetooth is for . ; And uh Bluetooth is mainly for cutting this cable . ; You know , the other day I was joking about that our wireless microphones were not , in fact , wireless
Bmr013_974	K . ; K . ; You ordered them already ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_83	But in general instead of the word " construct " , th here you might have " meaning " or " form " as well . ; OK ? ; So if there 's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . ; OK ,
Bmr006_289	Right . ; But I I I think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1028	So . ; So how does ; uh , maybe I 'm going in too much detail , ; but how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed spectral envelope ?
Bmr025_111	or that 's something you 're having to program ? ; Um , right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , ; Yeah . ; but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either
Bro014_1148	I see . ; So do you have a picture that sh ? ; Is this for a voiced segment , ; So - It 's Y
Bed014_123	OK , so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech . ; No . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1111	yeah . ; Oh . OK . ; It should be that , ; yeah .
Bmr027_1536	I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . ; Should we do digits ? ; Yeah . ; Uh .
Bro026_1031	If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters Uh ; Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i ; Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_60	Yeah , it 's just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner ; Actually th he did a SRT file for it . ; Mm - hmm . OK . ; And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format .
Bmr028_1055	but ; Well , humans are really good at that ; transfer function through the head , and things like that . ; Right . Even with one microphone .
Bed003_939	OK , ; so just dis dismiss everything . ; Close it and and load up the old state so it doesn't screw screw that up . ; Let 's see .
Bro005_429	Yeah . ; and straight features with delta - delta . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_991	So it it takes two fibers in to the one board . ; And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards , ; and then you have the synchronization issue . ; But that 's a question because that would
Bed015_661	I think the the " designate " that we have in terms of meaning is really the " highlight this thing with respect to everything else " . OK ? ; Right . ; So this is what what it means . ; But the second one seems to be useful
Bed003_1320	um opera premiers . ; Really ? ; So you know . ; Hmm .
Bed004_515	You 're you 're ; Hmm ? ; It was much too quick for me . ; OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying .
Bmr021_589	You 're talking about different files . ; I mean , it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing ; but , ; Yep .
Bro026_515	uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . ; Mm - hmm . ; It certainly doesn't take much space . ; Right .
Bro014_473	but ; Yeah . ; but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions . ; And that 's
Bro021_1011	What is that ? ; And we can , uh , put this inside . ; Yeah . ; And then we can ,
Bed008_231	hmm ; Ah , ; So it 's true or false ? ; OK . No no no ,
Btr001_218	which which ones do you are you studying ? ; It 's more of a Romance direction , ; or ? ; Um , yeah
Bro019_1303	But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian . ; Well ; Mm - hmm . ; But anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ?
Bro010_558	Yeah . ; Right ? ; And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1346	So They 're more lexically marked , right ? ; At least in English . ; Mmm . ; So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying ,
Bmr027_604	There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . ; Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . ; Yeah . ; So it 's unusual that that they , uh
Bro017_1261	That 's what he was saying , ; right . ; He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when , ; and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up ,
Bdb001_876	what you have to do is you have to basically ; Y yeah . You can use Perl to read it in and construct a internal representation that is essentially a lattice . ; But , the ; Yeah .
Bmr015_284	Um , ; so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in ; before on on more more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , ; from I guess higher level from my point of view .
Bmr026_1245	I mean the four thousand will be better ; and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good . ; It 'll be faster . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1443	Yeah , that 's a truly horrible way to do d it . ; One would hope ; Yeah , but I 'm just ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1192	but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline . ; Uh , it still won't be perfect because there 's noise . ; Uh , but ; And then there are s uh , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for , uh for this kind of de - reverberation .
Bed005_916	And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that . ; That , these guys did in a in a day . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr025_895	I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind ; but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now ; and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech ; maybe somebody will be interested in this
Bed012_782	Which ; where the ; Which ones ? ; S so so if the endpoint if the Go - there is Yes and No , then Go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty .
Bns002_1375	OK . ; I don't have previous experience ; I don't eh know if uh where it will it would fix . ; However , eh you know I 'm just doing this presentation
Bro015_155	Well , uh . Let 's let 's come back to this uh later . ; Um . OK . ; Um . Chuck , did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh HTK , ; No . I didn't .
Bmr005_777	it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . ; You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , ; or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . ; I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .
Bed003_168	Robert ? ; Well there there is a term that 's often used . ; That 's " saliency " , or the " salience " of an object . ; And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as " landmark - iness " .
Bsr001_2098	Yeah . ; OK . ; So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1378	Mm - hmm . ; was the alignments were w were different for s certainly different because they were independently trained . ; We didn't copy the channel zero alignments to channel one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_535	right ? ; the argument in a sense ? ; Usually . ; I I don't know if that 's always the case
Bro004_728	I we plan to start this ; uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these ; what we could do more as a as a research ; and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not
Bro021_809	They all need some some noise noise spectra ; No , I do that two t did two time . ; but they use every all use a different one . ; I have an idea .
Bmr031_493	maybe , you know , why why throw it away if you don't need to ? ; Um , on the other hand , ; um , I mean , ; it 's @ @ sixty kilohertz is plenty .
Btr002_138	Right . ; but , um , it 's , you know , conceivable . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_1225	You have to check with him . ; Yeah . ; OK . Actually , I have to run . ; I 'm into big ideas these days .
Bmr012_256	very small . ; Yep . ; Oh . ; Right .
Bro003_1120	Yeah , ; so , I guess the first thing is if w if we know how much a how long a a training takes , ; if we can train up all these these combinations , uh , then we can start working on testing of them individually , and in combination . ; Right ?
Bmr016_79	Um , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine , ; Mm - hmm . ; as opposed to connected digits . ; Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set ,
Bmr009_1045	Am I speaking Am I speaking Western ? ; Well and what and what 's Northern ? ; I think originally it was North Northwest ; Northwest ?
Bed002_363	any bit of it . ; Throw it all away . ; Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually . ; What ?
Buw001_990	So who who does this summarization ? ; Yeah , I 'm thinking that ; People in the meeting . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1090	So this this uh header , well , it 's it 's a problem . ; Of course , there are also some some solutions ; like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source route routing , ; so you don't have to put all the all the route
Bmr028_1364	because they 're not using an automatic system . ; So , it really ; But they don't run experiments . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_658	Yeah . ; Well ; Yeah . ; Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin .
Bmr019_1319	this this this secret information . ; because ; I think we can ha ; Yeah .
Bro028_629	But , uh , did you do you still , uh , get the mails ? ; You 're not on the mailing list or what ? ; Hmm - mm . ; The only , um , mail I get is from Mississippi State
Bmr029_934	Yeah , yeah . I was doing something for the SmartKom data collectioners . ; Yeah . ; Robert has taken his laptop t back to Germany so we needed a new synthesis machine . ; And we have now a SUN workstation in the library , which does the synthesis
Bed006_245	and um ; there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job ; because it it 's getting more complicated . ; So if you know anyone interested in in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to to write a mail to me or Jerry soon ,
Bed015_2137	See the the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . ; So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can then you can unfold it . ; Then you can . ; Mm - hmm , yeah .
Bro025_144	Sure . ; Yeah , we can do it later . ; But , still so , there will be a piece of software with , uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default ; and
Bmr006_1653	Yeah . ; And and but then we would need to label it . ; Yeah . ; It 's a good idea .
Bro017_17	Yeah , that 's usually what we do . ; We just sorta go around and people say what 's going on , what 's the latest uh ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro018_834	So I was going through and just double - checking that kind of think first , to see if there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; OK .
Bmr005_1176	So that 's not a lot of hours . ; Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ? ; Three Three hours . ; Yeah .
Bed016_785	right ? ; You know . ; The the film the film is gone , ; right ?
Bmr007_326	Because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing . ; These are simplifying assumptions , ; Yeah . ; didn't happen very often ,
Bed008_1545	which fifty do I do , ; I wanna see what people are using , ; so ; Well , it will inspire me .
Bed013_267	Which probabilistically will be good enough . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . So , it be it it 's an idea that one could n for for example run run past , um , ; what 's that guy 's name ?
Bro022_119	And then do it again . ; So you 're gonna use TIMIT ? ; Um , for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1104	Turn about is fair play , ; Al - Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever ; Sorry . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1823	Yeah . ; Or on or on multiple language multiple languages ? ; No . ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bed015_504	" what is now , ; what was past , ; what is in the future , ; where is this ,
Bmr015_636	Um , I did discover a couple other things by doing this though , ; and one of them is that , ; um , um , ; once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber .
Bmr021_268	Oh , I 'm thinking I don't know about the acoustics . ; That 's that 's all I was wondering about . ; And this way we can get a door - slam in the uh in the transcript file . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1012	or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context . ; So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . ; Now , how you determine that is another issue . ; But fo for the current problem , it would just be , " OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , " or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power
Bro003_1853	What does " SAMPA " mean ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; But I don't know if TIMIT o how is TIMIT .
Bro025_566	which is not really the s because , you anyway , you can't remove the stationary part fr I mean , non - stationary part from the signal . ; So ; Not using these methods anyway . Yeah . ; Yeah . So you just update only doing or update only the stationary components .
Bed012_292	A person says , " Where is X ? " , ; and we get a certain We have a Situation vector and a User vector and everything is fine ? ; An - an and and our and our ; Did you just sti Did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea ?
Bns002_1122	Right ? ; You know , uh if you are curious , uh I can I can I can provide you the n some of the proposals ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed003_970	I guess those are the main two things . ; It does learning , ; it has ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1898	But if I was eh , but maybe I 'll get some later . ; Mmm . ; Thanks . ; Well well , why don't we ?
Bmr002_1209	But I think that 's a bad solution . ; W We also need to d do this in terms of SmartKom , ; I mean , we 're collecting this as to build general English acoustic models . ; that can be that they can say " OK here 's the vocabulary
Bdb001_257	you know , people don't ; Yeah , ; v Look at it , words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , five maybe ? ; but we actually
Bmr028_880	I mean , one of the things that Dave was noticing we were talking this morning is that i it seems like and we do don't know this in detail , but it seems like you 're getting a lot from the channel adaptation , the speaker adaptation , and so forth . ; Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_700	It 's just a different topic . ; I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . ; Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . ; That 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this .
Bed003_1530	Right . ; Yeah . ; So by the way tha that structure that Robert drew on the board was like more um , cue - type - based , ; right ,
Bed009_1041	So this is a static thing . ; And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers . ; Going in and out the portals and con ; Mmm .
Bro017_1265	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so I think it this is available . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_1075	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . ; I see .
Bmr015_319	March second , I said . ; Yeah . ; Tomorrow . ; I 've been a day off all week .
Bmr012_429	um ; uh Broadcast News . ; Well it 's ; I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people
Bmr006_1821	Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . ; Yeah , ab absolutely . ; It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , ; Oh , yeah , sure .
Bro005_815	the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled . ; Hey ! ; Um , just you can just sit here . ; Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones
Bed015_300	Yeah . ; But that was mostly for reference purposes , ; just to refer to the meaning pole . ; I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning ,
Bmr020_762	Yeah . ; March O - one . ; Oh ! ; Or
Bmr013_1026	I said " For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown " . ; That 's right . ; However , he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed . ; Well we 're using the Crown P Z
Bns002_139	these sensors can be for example , uh checking that there is no fire , ; they can have some kind of uh let 's say infrared technology sensor , ; so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of of sensors , and without any other infrastructure . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_919	yeah . ; It it gets into a can of worms . ; Well , you ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_171	Short words . ; because ; I know ; is it partly , eh , c correctly identified words ?
Btr002_784	and so sometimes you have to , um , try to listen ; No . ; Or , turn up ; there 's no visual
Bsr001_332	I don't @ @ ; But , you know , that that might be the challenging part . ; No , I wish . ; No .
Bmr020_1827	I don't ; Either way would be fine with me , ; I don't really care . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2355	J just so we see something . ; Wow . ; How about use the thing that um ACIRI 's doing . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_182	Right ? ; and apparently it 's not actually the parsing of the XML raw ; that going from the XML to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast . ; Hmm .
Bns002_1579	um Um , ; maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available . ; So you have , in principle , here now the mapping of the different areas , um within GPS , ; and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS .
Bmr016_1931	an and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers . ; And , um , ; d ; Chuck pointed out that this is read speech ,
Bro014_1348	that 's ; and this is with five hundred twelve . ; Oh . ; OK .
Bro024_1924	I was thinking to do that next week . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro018_188	I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net ; and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle ; and train it to get the product of the output and it would work . ; But , it 's kind of crazy ,
Bro024_1772	So we need to combine these two . ; Uh , ; that 's that 's the best thing , is like the French Telecom system is optimized for the well matched condition . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1839	when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , um , you you 'll get , a uh an alignment with the wrong duration pattern ; Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . ; or it ; Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like
Bro023_293	And , ; uh , ; found that , uh , s single like , I just do a s normal Wiener filtering , like the standard method of Wiener filtering . ; And that doesn't actually give me any improvement over like
Bmr001_660	Who are they going to be ? ; What meetings are we going to record ? ; Us , to begin with . ; So which which meetings What meetings do we have ?
Bro016_907	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , ; there is also the spectral subtraction ,
Bro005_1333	I think we have to start cutting down . ; So uh ; Mmm . ; I think so ,
Bmr006_1382	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; Yeah . ; but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ?
Bed012_740	Wait . So you 're saying , next Tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , ; or just us three working on it , or or ? ; Uh . ; The whole group .
Bed015_725	Mm - hmm . ; I think that the way I we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of ; basically this is the information structure . ; OK , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus
Bmr016_1241	Yes . And that 's why there 're different tags on the glosses , ; OK . So , then it 's fine . ; on the different on the different types of comments , ; which we 'll which we 'll see in just a second .
Bro014_443	You know , ; so , ; um ; Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance this is back old on , uh on Italian uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched
Bro028_842	and ; So is this a histogram across different frequency bins ? ; Or ? ; Um , I think this i
Bmr010_1527	But it seems like if we just wanna get something to work , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; that , uh , their suggestion of of
Btr001_222	well , I studied I mean , I studied Old English for a while . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; and then I 've worked with Larry Hyman on like some of the Bantu languages .
Btr001_1662	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_800	Yeah . ; Uh , well , ; yeah that 'd be good . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1456	At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something , ; OK . ; I didn't know about that . ; I don't know .
Bmr009_1052	Yeah . ; I don't know what to do about it . ; I wouldn't know how to characterize mine either . ; And and so I would think I would say , I 've I 've got a mix of California and Ohio .
Bmr003_885	No . ; Now , there 's a plan . ; And then then w since we need some statistics do it three more . ; OK .
Bro028_347	I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization ,
Btr002_1868	Let 's just ; But they actually had a big list of , like , things that people had transcribed ; and then they were reading one them one by one ; and being , like , " What 's this ?
Bed017_541	I have a rough overview . ; Because , um , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords ; or uh , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just uh , individual ; Mmm . Mmm .
Bmr018_328	Well , but then they have to do ; but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_114	what do people think ? ; But the problem is again the the plug , or ? ; Wh ; The plug is proprietary .
Buw001_1010	And see score them ? ; They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain ; That 's right . ; Well , that 's the interesting thing , though .
Bmr009_1448	Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do , ; the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_936	I mean , usually they 're ; The the pressed ones last for ; well , not forever , ; they 've been finding even those degrade .
Btr002_782	It 's very good . ; Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though , ; and so sometimes you have to , um , try to listen ; No .
Bro024_1220	It 's fixed , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_606	Um . ; Eh Is this in the baseline ? ; or in uh ; In the
Bro005_690	And no not two thousand . ; Ugh ! I was impressed ; boy , ; two thousand .
Bro027_696	Mmm . ; On the in the ; Well , in the proposal , um , the input of the VAD network were just three frames , I think . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1235	Right . ; Did people wanna do the digits ; Uh ; or , um , do them together ?
Bed013_4	Yes . ; Whew ! ; I almost forgot about the meeting . ; I woke up twenty minutes ago , thinking , what did I forget ?
Bmr006_737	Mm - hmm . ; So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? ; Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_380	OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . ; So ; um , uh what 's uh Sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , ; um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them .
Bdb001_1103	However , you know , you want to have it , uh , time time uh , located in the discourse . ; So , ; um , ; if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking .
Bed006_1640	S ; An example wo would be nice ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1261	Unfortunately ; Yeah . ; Yeah , six dollars an hour . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1009	which is a service that you send an audio file , ; they do a first - pass speech recognition . ; And then they they do a clean up . ; But it 's gonna be horrible .
Bro012_1061	This there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? " ; Mmm . ; set uh of features , ; just mel cepstra ,
Bro003_415	right ? ; Or is ; I think ; I don't know anything about Finnish .
Bmr008_1750	Hmm . ; and I had an problem . ; Ah , that 's interesting , ; and it didn't give you good error messages .
Bed009_372	because um partly those are like X - schemas . ; Mmm . ; Definitely . ; the transition diagrams .
Bmr020_1632	Yeah . ; But I think none of this is stuff that really needs somebody doing these these uh , uh , explicit markings . ; Yeah . ; Excellent .
Bed015_1432	I mean ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; If you haven't read it . It 's nice .
Btr002_2042	and by the end of it , I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again ; Yeah . ; nine times in slow - mo ! ; Exactly .
Btr002_299	And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; You know , but I never usually put period and then new word " so " unless it 's like , end of the sentence and then , " So . "
Bmr019_1623	Yeah . ; I mean , I know about the first meeting , ; um , ; but the other one that you did ,
Bmr026_121	Ah . ; I mean that 's my intention . ; Yeah . ; Because the transcripts might not be right .
Bmr010_1421	Oh , OK . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential ; Yep . ; Yeah . It was only Gaussian . ; Oh , I see . I see .
Bns002_146	Yeah . ; So . ; Well , ; You know , it 's an interesting question .
Bmr029_381	Mm - hmm . ; But it 's it 's not really true . ; It 's it 's sort of fantasy . ; It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways .
Bro013_324	and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers . ; We 're not trying to prove anything to anybody . ; so . ; That 's fine .
Bmr003_2230	But . ; Yeah , I mean , we I had that last time . ; But uh there are actually that you know , there 's an extra there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_95	so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate . ; So . So uh , but uh , ; Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went " oh , man . ; Why didn't I notice that ? "
Bro014_1504	N um , not not not much is new . ; talk about ? ; So when I talked about what I 'm planning to do last time , I said I was , um , going to use Avendano 's method of , um , using a transformation , um , to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation . ; He has a trick for doing that involving viewing the DFT as a matrix .
Bmr020_713	Exactly . ; MTGC ; What is it again ? ; CR
Bro018_515	just to get an idea a rough idea of h if it really even makes a difference . ; You can get a little feeling for it that way , ; Yeah . ; yeah that is probably right .
Btr002_2183	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; No no visual input at all . ; Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation ,
Bro016_886	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Well . ; But , you know , some problems are harder than others ,
Bed004_329	or is that it ? ; Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says " Mode " which is the decision between the ; Yeah . ; OK , great .
Bro012_1186	And . ; Yeah , so I don't know . ; We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul , ; have a good voice detector ,
Bed013_905	OK . ; Is that supposed to be the international sign for interface ? ; I think so , yeah . ; Mmm . OK .
Bmr003_1414	I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing . ; Ye - Yeah . ; I mean we 're just gonna have ; Yeah ,
Bns002_68	So . ; OK . ; Miguel , please . ; Thank you .
Bro018_704	is is should it be shouldn't it be a one ? ; or should it should it be you know coronal instead of not coronal as it was labelled in the paper ? " ; So I ha haven't hunted down all the all the mistakes yet , ; Uh - huh .
Bro021_320	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro018_898	Yeah . ; Yeah . I 've been um , I 've been working with um Jeremy on his project ; and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features . ; Uh - huh .
Bns003_108	Eh ; No promises . ; No promises . ; No .
Bmr001_415	right , so you can ; Yeah . ; So , hang on ; so that would OK
Bmr027_139	But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . ; Well ; So . ; Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,
Bmr013_509	we should catch up on what Steve is , ; Oh , OK . ; uh I think that would be a good i good idea . ; Yeah .
Bed009_540	uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account . ; But One would have t have to see see the details . ; The specifics aren't really there yet . ; Yes .
Bro025_187	of of , uh , what things will be attacked . ; But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while ; because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_748	Yeah . ; I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing , ; OK . ; but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out ,
Bro014_466	and tested on high - speed conditions , I think , ; like on a highway ; and ; Right .
Bro025_201	We do still , however , have to consider its latency . ; So the issue is is , um , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ? ; Right . ; Um , what we 've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net , uh , to transform , um , all of the features that we use .
Bmr012_476	so that 's good . ; Although combining em worked well . ; it 's also ; I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News
Bmr010_192	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all , ; Yeah .
Bed010_781	Oh , OK . ; So you can insert your hand something ; Yeah . ; and there 's a correspondence between
Bmr020_443	although that 's that may be a misnomer , ; but basically we looked at cases where ; Uh , so we we used the punctuation from the original transcripts ; and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences .
Bro024_1676	but for high gain @ @ it 's I don't smooth . ; Mm - hmm . ; I just , uh it Experience shows you , if if you do the ; The best is to do the smoo smoothing as early as possible .
Bed009_367	OK . ; yeah . ; So we ha we have to get in on that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_967	Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? ; In other words , if ; Well , I have to ask him . ; And that 's that 's my email to him . That needs to be forthcoming .
Bed009_873	Yeah , OK . ; Good point . ; So in in in German you 've got uh most of this done with ; Mm - hmm . Also it 's uh it 's um Yes , uh the um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher .
Btr002_1830	You know , I ; And ; Huh . ; Sorry .
Bro013_372	Yeah but ; nnn . ; But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely . ; I mean , uh i if if there 's a if if
Bro003_2091	Isn't that what you 'll want ? ; Um . ; If you 're gonna do a KL Transform on it . ; Right , right .
Bed005_1056	The idea is to have these intermediate nodes . ; Right . ; Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state , ; which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it .
Bro024_624	It 's it 's a ; So that 's ; Which means decrease in word error rate ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1233	Cuz once they give us the data , it 's ours , ; and if they wanna make changes ; I mean , ours to sort of transcribe and annotate . ; The the p the point here is that it would be nice t for there to be one repository .
Bro010_777	or ? ; I think so . ; I have not here the proposal . ; So it 's it 's
Bmr031_576	Sample rate , ; You just get , like , one backchannel at a time or something . ; yeah . ; Oh , it 's shortened .
Bmr012_260	so the that that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second ; Mmm . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr026_503	I would like to . ; Yeah . ; Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap . ; I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,
Bmr016_177	but If we can try it ; OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits ; not as connected numbers . ; Right , and you can give an example
Bmr024_1169	That wasn't me . ; Um . well , ; Uh . ; Who 's that ?
Bmr005_1229	if we can get more data . ; the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here . ; Wow ! ; Well Or The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount
Bro017_1116	Yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_823	Oh , it 's really a kick . ; I think that 's fun . ; Yeah . ; And it sometimes changes the entire utterance , too .
Bro022_49	OK . ; OK . ; Um . ; Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal .
Bro019_143	The SRI recognizer has all this P - make customs stuff built into it . ; So . ; So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , ; Yeah .
Btr002_607	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; and another there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate ; but then that becomes
Bmr026_777	i overall . ; They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean definitely not significant .
Bsr001_2016	Bits , sixteen - K , ; OK , s ; Eh , good good . ; So at the end we 're all
Bro014_876	Yeah , ; but ; Yeah . ; Uh , so it 's noisy TIMIT .
Bmr022_258	And then when we get them back , if we see two L - beeps in a row ; It would be much easier . ; That 's probably better , ; Yeah , you have like a sanity sanity check on them .
Bed015_837	The form bit ; Yeah . ; because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes . ; OK .
Bro022_916	So , it I , uh ; Is ? ; The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them . ; Right .
Bmr023_1131	eh , and also they 're not I mean , as I understand it , you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . ; Right ? ; Right . ; I mean , these are just discriminative ,
Bmr002_779	Oh , you 've got one . ; What are you looking at here ? ; He 's got the Mark - up Framework . ; Oh , yeah .
Buw001_2204	Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking . ; So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? ; Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ? ; I really liked that .
Bed005_419	There is a feature called " Discourse - Status " , ; When there 's a feature . ; Yeah . ; And so whenever I just say , " Write " , it will it will put this in here .
Bro025_222	And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , uh , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for . ; So , um , all of that is is , uh still seems like a good idea .
Bmr014_840	But ; Just put the button on on the web page which say " please send me the the scripts " . ; Oh that 's interesting . ; That 's right .
Bro004_1336	the , I think in th ; We have the little tiny IBM machine that might someday grow up to be a big IBM machine . ; It 's got s slots for eight , ; uh IBM was donating five ,
Bmr011_632	Yeah . ; And y it 'd certainly gets skew . ; I mean it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of ; once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data .
Bmr024_506	So , r right now you get f fal you know , false false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , breath or something like that , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; and I 'd be interested to know the wha if you retrain
Btr001_1631	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Right . ; And yet you have to check the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre - segmenter .
Btr002_3280	I I also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials . ; Uh - huh . ; Somet ; Oh yeah .
Bro013_240	if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . ; It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's , you know it 's it 's high .
Bmr003_456	Uh , in fact we get it for free ; cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . ; Oh . ; Great .
Bed006_45	and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type , ; Oh wow . ; Well . ; and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper .
Bro022_1156	Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . ; And ; Well . I am working in that now , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr003_265	Yeah . ; tapes . ; And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts , ; how do we distribute the audio files ,
Bro024_1210	The VAD ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; There first , a threshold on the probability @ @ That puts all the values to zero or one .
Bed014_357	But anyway , so that 's , um ; Oh yeah , like uh , I solved the the problem of um we were talking about how do you ; various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote " count as a noun phrase " , ; you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way .
Bmr003_2330	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah ! ; I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . ; Wow .
Bmr009_502	yeah . ; And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here . ; Um and that that 's the indicator that we 're getting . ; But anyway , yeah , we 're not disagreeing on any of this ,
Bed014_245	This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? ; You know , and it 's cool , it works out that way . ; Hmm . ; So , the the people at Saarbruecken and I decided not to touch it ever again .
Bmr003_671	I have a bunch of hours , ; Oh , we have . ; I 'm sorry . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1376	Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " . ; And and those those can be two different things . ; Uh , yeah , yeah . ; Sure , sure .
Bns003_598	because ffft that 's uh , it would be a a wonder if , uh , it hook in at the same area , you know . ; Yeah , ; No , no , no . ; Yeah .
Bro026_742	For the most part it 's it 's Gaussian mixtures . ; Oh , OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bed009_415	Yeah . ; dialogue act , ; yeah . ; Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to I think that 's not going to be good enough .
Bed003_436	and ; The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ? ; Or also unknown ? ; Or un unknown ,
Bmr021_352	so , you can use the the shell " AND " operator or something . ; Then I just move the new wavefile to the , you know , to the old wavefile , ; Right . ; and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly .
Bed002_382	Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . ; But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . ; And , so that 's that 's the quote " deep " that we 're trying to get at . ; And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to
Bed011_226	So I don't exactly understand ; like I I I guess we 're trying to limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , ; right ? ; But who is it that has to care about this ,
Bmr015_119	And that would be a little easier . ; Well how many are how how often does that happen ? ; Mmm , five or six times . ; Oh , so it 's not very much .
Bmr019_997	And then there would be backchannels , ; but it would be the person who asked the question . ; Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling . ; And , you know , sometimes you have the Yeah , uh - huh .
Bns001_1279	eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast . ; They are discussed since , you know , ten years or whatever . ; The specification are rather stable and and available ; but we have only islands in that .
Bro024_288	uh , ; so that , you know , the performance should be better that second time . ; Um , ; and I think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training I 'm sure vary from place to place .
Bmr031_1686	I think we 're done . ; Should we do , uh , simultaneous digits so that we actually have time for tea ? ; Why why don't we ? ; OK .
Bed008_1027	I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user ; you know ; Ah . ; hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something
Bro012_1448	Mm - hmm . ; And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that , again , was speaker - dependent with lots of feature selection
Bro014_1361	Yeah , but it 's the same frame ; and ; Oh , it 's that time - frequency trade - off thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2226	And so , i i i it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete . ; And , ; OK . ; so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing
Bed011_127	And um And then after three tasks the system breaks down . ; And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator . ; And says " Sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . " ; And we sort of get the idea what people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human , or know , or assume they speak to a human .
Bro024_714	So . ; That 's just ; So , ; m
Bmr019_960	Yeah , I know it by heart . ; So , um , there 's one point when you 're running down the stairs . ; Uh - oh . ; Right ?
Bed002_232	It 's just a dark alley . ; But you can touch it . ; If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , ; and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth .
Bmr013_553	Are are these kinds of words that people never the " huh "s and the " hmm "s and the " huh " and the uh ; These k No , I 'm serious . ; There are all these kinds of functional , uh , elements . ; I don't know what you call them .
Bro022_339	uh , r uh , then I don't see how that would make it louder . ; OK . ; Yeah , ; I see .
Bmr016_281	Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . ; I haven't ever listened to TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; So I don't really know how it compares .
Bmr016_332	for adaptation . ; No , I 'm serious , ; so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , ; Yeah .
Bed009_417	yeah . ; Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to I think that 's not going to be good enough . ; I I don what uh what I meant by that . ; So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea .
Bed009_719	no syntactic analysis ; but in the next release there will be some . ; Hmm . ; How 's it
Btr001_826	And it sometimes changes the entire utterance , too . ; Oh it does . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1161	and a couple of others , ; not many . ; So " wanna " is another one , ; " going " uh , " gonna " is another one ,
Bro007_310	OK . ; And what and what 's OGI forty - five ? ; Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , ; The bottom one there ?
Buw001_1410	Hmm . ; And " interesting " is more interesting than " important " . ; i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate . ; You know , I think inter " interesting " is is non - threatening in
Bed012_924	OK . ; So . ; And form u starts at the level of noun Or actually , maybe even sounds . ; Phoneme .
Bro005_1369	And um , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models um , uh asynchrony in any way ; or um Yeah . ; Oh ! ; OK .
Bro011_392	There 's a bunch of data that l around , ; that people have done studies like that w way way back ; right ? ; I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of
Bed013_114	e I 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on , ; you know , I mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . Right ? ; I mean ; just the fact that we 'll get The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ?
Bro014_35	uh , cuz he 's been in Europe . ; Doo - doo . ; So . ; I have something just fairly brief to report on .
Bmr005_898	That 's alright . ; Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say . ; They they ; Di - dif different different bandwidth .
Bro027_221	the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . ; Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . ; And But if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set ; I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora ,
Bmr022_1126	because the group 's pretty small . ; But ; Yeah . ; Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's it 's possible to recover from backups ,
Bmr021_377	This is very fast . This this really runs quickly . ; Wow . ; And that 's ; That must have been suspenseful .
Bmr026_332	Um And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . ; One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred ; alright , excuse me ; ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .
Bmr012_1137	I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that . ; The Springer mike . ; Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up ; and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to
Bro024_660	which is like some fifty percent improvement . ; S Wait a minute . ; Start with a different what ? ; Different prototype ,
Bmr007_262	Yeah . ; Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to to because the the overlap is , uh on is only the in the final " S " of the of the the fin the the end the end word of the , um previous speaker with the the next word of the the new speaker . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I considered that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an " X " with a and the idea is probably , eh when eh when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh eh , we h we have eh eh confusion with eh eh noise .
Bro027_191	Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . ; Oh . ; Wow . ; Yeah .
Btr002_529	Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , um , better than a lot of female voices . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro003_2082	Did we just run out of disk , ; um ; I think I think apparently , the , uh ; or ?
Btr002_3156	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ? ; you know ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_727	Like it 's ; Are you assuming that or not ? ; Like is that to be I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . ; If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists .
Bmr027_706	Right ? ; Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file . ; Yeah . You 're right . ; Well I you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy .
Bro028_228	Mm - hmm . ; Working on the second stream . ; Of course we have ideas on this also , ; but w we need to try different things
Bmr014_337	Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_788	and so it 's We we haven't thought it through . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Always @ @ .
Bed003_182	Yeah , ; we meant , uh , touristic reasons . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr031_1057	Uh - huh . ; Well , for speed . ; Uh . ; Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load .
Bed013_1281	In ter ; not the the choices of " where is X " or " how do I get to X " . ; Just " where is X " . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1201	Mm - hmm . ; I I I really wonder though . ; I mean we 've had these discussions before , ; and and one of the things that struck me was that uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information .
Btr001_2043	Cuz I know it was mentioned . ; Mm - hmm . ; Also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds . ; Yeah .
Bed017_409	and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , ; and we always give out the same answer , ; so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , ; and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system .
Bro010_9	that was programmed for yesterday I guess . ; Uh ; Yesterday ; Uh
Bed015_1048	but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth ; if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , ; linear time , linear spaces , ; like , you know , are are they doing something serially
Bmr023_476	Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . ; Um , ; and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , ; but I 've got a bunch of
Bmr018_599	Yeah . ; so ; There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot . ; there were t there was there was one h one bump at ze around zero , which were the native speakers ,
Bmr019_1763	It 's difficult . ; You e you have , eh you are lucky , ; and you you find a solution in in in some few tim uh , months , eh ? ; OK .
Bmr024_126	Yeah . ; And ; I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . ; So . I think it 'll work .
Btr002_1166	Well , that 's lovely . ; Yeah , it doesn't really matter . ; Same here ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_601	But " walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , " and " walked into the cafe and broke his nose , " ; that 's sort of ; Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous . ; I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle ,
Bmr023_85	Oh . ; I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them , ; Oh , ; oh .
Bns003_110	No promises . ; No . ; Ah , he 's very hard to sell . ; So it 's about one hour to put this , uh hard disk in
Bed015_26	And there 's two things . ; And so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . ; Um ; And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism .
Bro027_838	Mmm ? ; Those two ? ; So there is just this feature stream , the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta . ; No .
Bmr011_292	So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room ; and how it how the recordings are done , ; and that kind of thing . ; And , um . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , uh , handle multi - channel recording .
Btr001_1191	OK , ; so um ; Oh , ; uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ?
Bmr003_2321	I mean , we 've been been been lax and lucky . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Lax .
Bmr019_1081	and we will Yes , we 're gonna try . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I was telling Don , do not take this as an example of how people should work . ; Do as I say ,
Bro019_1627	So you 're not getting the actual formants per se . ; You 're getting the Again , you 're getting sort of the , ; uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_102	The part down there , where there 's the maximum number of of , um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to s to code stress , uh , sentence stress as possible indication of , uh information retrieval . ; So it 's like , you know , rather , lively discussion there . ; What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ? ; Oh ,
Btr001_195	I was getting a little frustrated ; because I would put a lot of things into parentheses ; and then go back over it ; and go back over it again
Bns002_297	uh , ; of course , this is only intended for unicast transmissions , ; I mean , only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node . ; OK ?
Bro027_1366	Slightly bad . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out .
Bed009_71	Mm - hmm . ; and um it does require some some knowledge of of those grammars and and and some ling linguistic background . ; But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone . ; OK So That sounds good .
Bmr006_1022	But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . ; One one of these is to eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . ; And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . ; OK .
Bmr015_642	because when it 's ; Sure . ; a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap . ; And if we 're gonna study types of overlaps ,
Bmr030_881	So , I do get jobs running on my machine all the time . ; Um , But , uh , ; So so that 's that 's sort of what it is . ; Yep .
Bro007_51	No , the KLT . ; And those two together . ; Two HTK . ; That 's it .
Bmr006_562	So . And that takes a while . ; Yeah . ; Generating a clone ? ; Yeah , that 's a good point .
Bmr005_1412	Uh , they seem to have some problems with it . We can we can talk about that later . ; Um , but , again , Jerry is Jerry 's open ; So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , ; uh Jerry was open to it but I I s
Buw001_1905	Who ? ; Landay or Jason ? ; Landay . ; OK .
Bed005_1376	Anyway . So we may have to ; Yep . ; This is with the whole thing , ; we may have to build another data stru
Bed005_288	It 's correct , ; but I don't know where it gets it from . ; " See " . ; Oh , " see " .
Bns003_814	but um , ; about two years ago the numbers of students were , um , studying computer science , uh , started to increase again ; and so in one or two years we will have , uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis ; and so I think there will also be , uh , many students which are joining in this work .
Bed015_1620	ehhh , ; where ; OK , so a situation like " Bob said he was going to the movies " , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have " I " there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_723	uh ; So . ; Yeah . ; So there are clearly are spectral effects .
Bro016_474	So ; adding the noises from from the SpeechDat - Car . ; Um . ; That 's
Bmr028_754	Uh , g megabytes and mega many megabytes , too . ; Um , what what , uh ? ; We have a kernel on Popcorn , too . ; Right .
Bmr003_1157	Well , for ten thousand dollars . ; So , meanwhile ; Oh . ; What Well , it was thirty times
Bmr030_182	I don't know , ; but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all . ; I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight . ; Hmm .
Bro022_640	I 'm sorry . ; Yeah . ; The complete SRI system is one point two . ; You you were HTK .
Bro012_285	And there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data ; and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1079	their compression . ; They have their own CRC , ; their their own error correction mechanism . ; Oh .
Btr001_1581	OK . ; Yeah , ; and when you 're when you 're , um , just checking you 're You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up , ; Mmm .
Bmr008_618	Yeah , y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing , which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough , ; because somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base speaking English . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed010_835	But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , ; Alright . ; so , um And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , " is there an ontology API that that " ; There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies
Bmr008_1250	Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group ; Right . ; uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning , ; so this is not a lot of people .
Bmr006_639	I just don't remember , it might be DC . ; Yeah . ; And that has enough for about four more meetings right now . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_91	Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting . ; We have a little more to discuss . ; Yeah . ; But , uh , we 're we 're basically ready to do it .
Bed003_1359	It works like this . ; The uh , um I mean . ; The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t ; They tried to figure out the intention ,
Bmr007_981	Yeah . ; and and so where do you get your thresholds from ? ; From something that you looked at . ; So you always have this problem , you 're going to new data
Bmr006_1293	And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . ; It 's spread out . ; Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1704	I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . ; Well , it ; Yeah . ; but then , again that kills your discourse analysis .
Bmr011_1182	but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? ; And the other one is , um , uh , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? ; So , um , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting ; We had spoken with them about it .
Bmr009_1634	No , I can do digits if if But I don't wanna butt in , or something . ; Then Alright . You go ahead . ; But if there 's something on the rest of the ; I 'm I 'll be around just have to make call before quarter of .
Bmr016_280	Oh , I may well be . ; Yeah , no TI - digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe . ; I haven't ever listened to TI - digits . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2100	" seven point five " . ; Does it output the word ; " Seven point five " . ; Right ,
Bed014_126	Mm - hmm . ; Now and this concept - to - speech module has certain rules on how if you get the following syntactic structure , how to map this onto prosodic rules . ; Better . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_613	I think that 's the key thing . ; And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there . ; OK . Alright . ; And then , um , uh , also Dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation
Bro013_265	It 's not controlled at all , I mean . ; Bless you . ; Thanks . ; I Yeah . I think it 's it 's
Bed014_867	and make it sort of bomb - proof . ; Yep . ; Bomb proof ! ; Good .
Bmr008_786	Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable . ; I think we should , because other databases do . ; It 's sort of a political thing . ; And there are some general
Bmr009_1273	and the another one is " if you had to characterize yourself your accent , what would you say ? " ; Won't they answer the same thing ? ; Well they might only answer only one of the questions ; but if
Bmr022_392	And when they transcribe this meeting it 's gonna be really impossible . ; I think it would ; Yeah , that 's funny . ; W we 're saying " beep " . Yeah for instance .
Bro028_537	but they 're , uh they 're really high . ; I I I don't find that surpri ; So ; I mean , we
Bmr005_1016	but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits . ; Right . ; Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1689	That was very offending , ; Yeah , yeah . ; very offending . ; Is that all all of them are based on all the others ,
Bed003_1781	Not a rich language . ; So we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we actually did not want to constrain it too much ,
Bro019_244	Well , if you have , ; um ; Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script ; and you just had a , uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run ,
Bro012_1105	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD . ; Because as as you 've mentioned .
Bmr016_1441	cuz in like in Switchboard , you would see e all of these forms , ; but they all were like " uh " . ; You mean just the single letter " a " as in the particle ? ; The transcription or
Bmr025_875	Well well you have a PDA ; and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , ; I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_794	and you can sort of you can sort of keep it going a little bit . ; Right . ; Oh , I see . ; Oh , OK .
Bro019_499	And ; So , I 've been actually running some s ; So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab . ; I have to to to test whether it works first or not
Btr002_3106	I was like , " M You might wanna check this out . " ; That 's right . That 's right . ; Yeah , I do remember that . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1127	I I I haven't checked them all , ; but just spot - checking . ; They 're fantastic . ; I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , uh , uh , uh , Ron Kay , uh , volunteered to to do some of that .
Bmr016_1680	No , I looked for that , ; but that doesn't actually exist . ; And it may be , ; I don't I can't explain that .
Bmr008_137	That 's a separate question . ; So , we 'll We 'll get to that in a moment . ; Well , I agree with him , though . ; I
Bed012_63	No , it 's certainly not this . ; Nuh . ; So you could just Couldn't you just run a ; XSL . Yeah .
Bro023_1261	Yeah , ; it 's kind of built into that . ; Hmm . ; And and that 's why we have found that it it does help .
Bro003_181	And again , I guess the p the plan is , uh , to uh then given this ; What 's the plan again ? ; The plan with these data ? ; With
Bmr002_991	gacks ; Transcriber ; Whoa ! ; So it 's very interest I mean , it 's interesting that one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman from the LDC
Bed008_1393	either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , ; right ? ; Now this guy he looks at the value of H ; say it 's two ,
Bmr020_1765	right ? ; Yeah . ; How w how will they tell the difference between that sort of background and the dormal normal background of two people talking at once ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_2361	and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . " ; Like a shrug or a vocal some some sort of like , " Well , there it is " . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bed008_856	well , I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have , ; so people say how do I get to the castle ; and this usually means they wanna go there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_996	so ; no , no , ; because that 's , uh , that 's why I mentioned that it is important thing . ; But , currently there 's only one new group member , Sven Buchholz , who will figure out the thing , hmm how to say , um , the taking into account the end system , or the limited end system capabilities with respect to mobility and the network itself .
Bed006_618	OK . ; So we don't have to worry about um ; But uh it 'll tell you that this is what 's showing in Heidelberg and there you go . ; Yeah .
Bro013_697	which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum ; and that 's supposed to d um deal uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation ; and um the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer ; um so he does this um method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um frequency resolution .
Bmr018_529	Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it . ; Maybe , I just don't I don't see that it 's a ; Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster . ; Well , I mean , that 's the i I I think that might be a personal style thing .
Bsr001_2567	Right . ; It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way . ; Doesn't it ? ; That 's right ,
Btr001_2389	It 's just a normal " uh " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But it 's stuck in
Bro003_1525	So I don't know where you 're ; Stephane , where you 're doing your computations . ; If i so , you 're on an NT machine , ; so you 're using some external machine
Bmr021_848	No , but they should be close , since this ; I mean the ; Anyway . But I can certainly try the SRI front - end without uh VTL . ; That sh that 's that 's certainly quick to do .
Btr001_2678	Initially it was words all spelled out , ; Mm - hmm . ; so " ONE " ; Oh .
Bmr003_1520	You have to turn off your mike . ; Yeah . ; Oh , you do ? ; Well he was
Bed017_199	So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is . ; The output . ; So what decisions does this make ? ; OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model .
Bmr028_905	No - It 's not a pro ; Yeah . ; Well , but for a ; But , for s for scoring , you can do it or not do it as you choose .
Bed014_1383	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; and if you over - generate then you 'll have to do more . ; I mean , if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use uh , in your initial matching then you 'll match some things ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1451	Now , Srini is worth talking to on this , ; Mmm . ; cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into ; Ah !
Btr002_2033	Yeah . ; or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . ; Right . ; Oh , god !
Bro018_738	f so for every phone there is there is a um a vector of ones and zeros f uh corresponding to whether it exhibits a particular phonological feature or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so when you do your
Bmr025_880	Yeah , ; that be good . ; I mean , if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel ; but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort ,
Bed002_468	or something . ; And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona ; you know , th the In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter . ; So , where would we extract that information from ?
Bed011_631	Yeah . ; Yeah , or or both . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean like for example my my father is about to travel to Prague .
Bed015_1501	You 're when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is ; I mean , you know who the speaker is . ; In fact , that 's kind of constraining how ; in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it .
Bro017_1089	then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub . ; And they were calling from the pub . ; And they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore . ; And one day there was there was no plane .
Bmr008_740	and I don't ; Well , it 's ; And somebody might . ; Or adapta or adaptation .
Bmr001_191	Yeah . ; I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy . ; Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway . ; Are we ?
Bns002_1300	Yeah , and and and whatever kind of of eh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have , is Bluetooth - based . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; Yeah , or will be Bluetooth - based . ; Will be .
Bro003_472	And that 's the ; Right . ; and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language . ; Right .
Bmr002_610	Yeah . ; You know , I saw I know you know about the big book . ; Yeah . ; I think you got it as a prize or something .
Bed003_955	Like , we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of ; Yeah . ; Srini ; OK .
Bro023_1364	So ; s Yeah , I mean , I think the only thing is that ; I would worry about it a little . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1038	plus N . ; Right . ; No ? ; Right .
Bmr003_395	And ; They had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have DAT recorders . ; I see . ; So it is sort of far field stuff .
Btr002_2880	and , um ; th cuz the claim had been , ; actually o one of the people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that , " Well , there probably the overlaps only occur during setup and , um , you know , at the end when we 're leaving . " ; Oh !
Bmr007_201	Mm - hmm . ; because we 're people who 've talked to each other , ; um we know basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other ; so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be
Bro005_1031	Mm - hmm . ; And just look take that case and then look over all the different things . ; How does that How does that compare between the ; So all the all the test sets you mean ,
Bro017_1157	Hmm . ; What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance . ; Turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_602	Overlaps . ; and it was very hard to tell ; I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who . ; Mmm .
Bro003_254	And there are so many other differences between these different databases . ; I mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car , ; and some of it 's ; I mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences .
Bmr012_693	until people have a chance to edit it . ; Mm - hmm , exactly . ; Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1138	OK . ; Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , ; Yeah . ; Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .
Bmr005_150	and And ; Oh . ; That aspect . ; Yeah .
Bro013_182	what 's what 's wrong uh what what is different between TI - digits and these digits ; and ; What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ? ; It 's point eight percent ,
Buw001_1433	Um , ; getting just , uh , digital pictures ; a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting . ; Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned .
Bro022_949	Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now . ; I just wanted to to see if it 's what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem . ; And it seems to be the case . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_153	Yeah . ; And that 's just a huge amount of training for it . ; So it 's um I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_692	Yeah . ; I think it was ; Oh yeah , I don't know . ; The demo ?
Bro005_785	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; I see , ; yeah .
Bro019_251	the fastest currently available machine ; and and run your job there . ; Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , ; which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it
Bed009_64	because w we have we face two ways . ; Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , ; or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system ; and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse
Bmr025_703	um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . ; And I have uh so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , ; and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . ; On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy .
Bmr007_306	OK , so that 's good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question , ; That 's that 's good , yeah , cuz the overall rate is ; Yeah . ; Statistical .
Bed015_378	But it y y it 's yeah , just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around . ; uh , you know . ; M moving it to another place , right . ; Yeah .
Bed012_828	People have the inverse problem with my name . ; OK . ; I always have to check , every time y I send you an email , a past email of yours , to make sure I 'm spelling your name correctly . ; Yeah .
Bed016_152	and ; Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro012_847	you know ? ; So uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times , ; another time it went thr ; I mean i is , you know , how how much how much vari
Bmr030_717	and it 'll query Abbott , ; and give you a a list of all the disks that we have ; and then , uh , what 's on each one , ; and then it shows how big the disk is
Bmr009_763	Mm - hmm . ; Anyway So that 'd be great . ; Good . OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_381	and ; A little bit , ; I mean , he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of ; Yeah ,
Bed006_1015	Under so o under action schema there 's a list that can include both both things . ; ye Yeah , they they would both schemas would appear , ; Right . ; so what is the
Bro004_104	But actually we didn't train network on uh both types of data ; I mean uh phonetically ba ; phonetically balanced uh data and task data . ; We only did either task task data or uh broad data .
Bed002_789	Um . The uh , ; um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . ; So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . ; So that 's part one .
Bro024_811	Well , that 's ; Yeah . ; So ; I also have the feeling that um , the reason ye why it doesn't work is yeah , that the models are much are t um , not complex enough .
Bmr003_1025	OK . ; OK . ; Oh , of their ; Oh !
Bsr001_860	What what what data are they using ? ; What is the ; Uh , Switchboard . ; Oh , OK .
Bro024_683	I mean , that is ; Yeah , ; that too . ; It 's a very , very small set , actually .
Bed015_479	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK . ; Do you want to do the same for space ? ; Wha - sorry ?
Bro008_87	So ; How much how much better was the best system than ours ? ; Well , we don't know yet . ; Mmm .
Bmr001_261	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb . ; So I I still think it 's potentially interesting to do that .
Bmr006_712	I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . ; Yeah . ; Duration . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_756	This is the ; Must be a European project . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr006_652	We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . ; That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro023_332	cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering . ; No , ; it 's like , uh , ; Mmm .
Bns003_184	And , um ; But , um ; I think everybody should take a look to the web pages , and inform Claudia if something , uh , has to be improved or if there 's some comments ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_497	And then renormalize . ; Mmm . ; Right . ; Cool .
Bed015_1792	Yeah . ; What ? ; No . ; Ask me about it later
Bed014_1015	OK , so l forget about the b the camping thing . ; So let 's eh , any other problems w w w ? ; But , I suggested Monday . ; If that 's a problem for me then I shouldn't suggest it .
Bmr019_1225	I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before , ; how you time - align things that are overlapping anyway . ; So ; That 's wonderful .
Bmr011_258	and that ; And there was some talk about , uh , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to ; Yep . ; So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible .
Bmr020_564	but then Chuck came in ; and so you paused for a second ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed015_1113	Yeah . ; Um . ; Right , " this guy I know from school came for dinner " does not mean , um , " there 's a guy , I know him from school , ; and he came over for dinner " .
Bro024_1238	So three three hundred and fifty inputs , ; m ; uh , ; six thousand hidden nodes and two outputs .
Btr002_1202	I we already have one , ; I could add ane another one ; Right . ; we so , w you know , maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted .
Bmr027_932	Mm - hmm . ; People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . ; My , um I was thinking that with the NSA meetings , I 'd like there are three of them , ; and they 're uh , I I will have them done by Monday .
Bmr014_1049	Yeah . ; It means also we don't have to g To give it to them . ; I mean like like Morgan was saying they they ; They just have to make sure that it is available to them .
Bro019_151	uh I fired off a training job , ; and then I fired off a recognition job ; and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , " uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously ; s my m my jobs are not getting run . "
Bmr022_481	Yeah . ; I don't know . ; Hmm , interesting . ; Easy enough to figure out .
Btr001_1076	kinda go " Well there 's two , ; so here . " ; Mm - hmm . ; It must be really rare though ,
Bro027_1624	So there are there was , like , some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; The
Bmr024_1123	Alright . ; Alright . ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bro024_898	Um , ; But I don't know how much effect it this have , ; but they do that . ; Now ?
Bro028_759	I don't know . ; Yeah . And then divide the mixtures in half . ; and ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_484	So ; Oh , yeah , fifty - seven ; point ; Right .
Bro026_1023	No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have uh , you know , categories . ; Right . ; And I think this the important categories are the words , and not the phones . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1278	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; But , yeah , ; actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises
Bns002_173	Mm - hmm , ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network .
Bro023_1586	VAD - Is this is this the ? ; It 's the France - Telecom - based spectra , s uh , Wiener filtering and VAD . ; So it 's their system ; but just I replace their noise estimate by this one .
Bmr019_251	and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling . ; Oh , that 's right . ; I I did look that up . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1540	Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except ; Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . ; And and I cer and I So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back . ; Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ?
Bmr006_691	Oh , you did that by hand ? ; Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh " Why . " ; Can I see that ? ; Can I get a copy ?
Bmr020_1581	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Something like that ? ; The other problem is , that when it when it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech .
Bro024_760	Yeah . ; So here here I mean , I found that it 's if I changed the noise estimate I could get an improvement . ; So that 's so it 's something which I can actually pursue , is the noise estimate . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1223	oh you did wear it this morning ? ; Yeah . ; OK , it 's off , so you can put it on . ; I yeah , I don't want it on ,
Bmr020_592	and that helped some . And stuff like that . ; Wasn't there wasn't there some result , Andreas ; Yeah ; I I thought maybe Liz presented this at some conference a while ago about uh , backchannels
Bed008_382	Right . ; if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark , ; meaning more likely to be viewed ; Yeah .
Bed004_369	so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it is is that . ; Right , OK . ; Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose , ; and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever .
Bmr016_1747	Yeah . ; Tickle ? ; they meant " tickle " as in ; Yeah .
Bed012_427	Wel ; W OK . ; So , someone asked a question . ; Yeah .
Bro014_529	Good . ; Yeah . ; Work to do . ; Uh - huh .
Bro015_194	Who did that ? ; Um . ; I don't know ; but it 's the company who prepared the Italian database ,
Bed005_778	and I guess , pwww ! ; let 's say that by the end of spring break , I 'll try to come up with some general story about , um , construction grammar , ; and what constructions we 'd use ; and how all this might fit together .
Bmr026_469	The " more disk space " button ? ; Yep . ; Skip the rest of the conversation . ; Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings .
Bro005_1140	So it was sort of behaved reasonably . ; Is tha that a fair ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1270	and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories . ; And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy ; Yeah . ; um but if it has if it 's supposed to be categorized in category X then the corresponding schema X will be among the structures that that follow .
Bmr027_494	of of how my my ; the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy ; uh , ; h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to
Bmr006_1761	Yeah . ; For the public one . ; the ? ? ; You know .
Bmr031_638	Yeah . ; Hey , it 's it 's the first time I 've ever heard you ask for less data . ; Hmm . ; It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short .
Bed010_625	This is usually um ; I should there should be an " L " , though . ; Well actually you have only have two choices . ; You can either do a two - point or a three - point
Bro004_914	How many how many nets do you have ? ; I mean , It 's just Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs . ; No nets . ; Begin to work in this .
Bmr025_266	Then it 's Steve Renals . ; OK . ; Oh , OK . ; So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats ,
Bsr001_335	No . ; Wow . ; No . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1494	Yeah . Yeah . ; OK . Yeah . This will be after September anyway , ; Right . ; But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the take the pitch from the real data , feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data .
Bed004_270	Yeah . ; but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . ; And and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent . ; Mmm .
Bro003_1619	So , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah , ; OK .
Bro013_120	Well , yeah . ; So ; I I I 'm sorry . ; What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ?
Bmr011_1004	Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's ; yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of ; Well we can talk about more details later . ; um , you know ,
Bro011_526	Yeah . ; And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_819	So in other words ; Right . ; right , ; It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that .
Bns001_1740	Unless unless we speak about quality of service , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1290	but aren't where we 're at right now , ; Like like what you call certain things , ; so it 's ; which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now .
Bmr019_661	So . ; Cool . ; OK . So the s the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ? ; Oh .
Bmr013_453	But also in terms of comparability of , um , ; Mm - hmm . ; Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . ; what you gain
Bmr026_1078	Right . ; because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . ; That are from another ; Right .
Bro018_584	and and uses them to recreate the boundary for the test set . ; So , given these um these features , or or these these examples , um , critical examples , which they call support f support vectors , then um given a new example , if the new example falls um away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being a part of this particular class ; Oh . ; and otherwise it 's the other class .
Bro023_470	um ; So , I still don't have the word error rate . ; I 'm sorry about it . ; But the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six .
Bed003_1265	we have a whole region " in a e ; That 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . ; Yeah , exactly . ; Right ?
Bmr016_541	I don't know if it would be useful for comparison , ; but it 's embedded numbers . ; Well I don't know . ; I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT .
Bro014_14	Almost . ; Alright ! ; Let 's do image processing . ; Yes , again .
Bmr002_659	Sure . Sure . Sure . ; Sure . ; Sure . ; OK .
Bmr024_1461	And then , from there we do , ; um ; There 's a lot of , ; actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model .
Bro023_1142	Or some other smoothing ? ; Oh , no , ; you still end up with zeros in the s spectrum . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1136	But if th if there is an XML file that or format that it can also read ; I mean it just reads this , ; right ? ; When it starts .
Bmr005_1283	i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now ; Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , ; but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . ; And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,
Bdb001_583	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And in this format you would have a different tag , ; which which would , uh , be linked to the link .
Bro003_1743	He 's he 's gonna be here for years . ; Yeah . ; And so , um , ; over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot .
Bro022_1093	because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , those are the regions where there are , like ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_686	Yeah . ; Throughout the meeting . ; Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , ; with eh , a exact mark .
Bed015_1768	Mm - hmm . ; Confidence or something like that . ; Yeah , ; and the fact that I 'm , you know the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever ,
Bro018_1034	then run them through again ; but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know , affects the score . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1527	Twenty percent relative gain . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_731	That 's ; Uh - y w when I say it 's worse , it 's not it 's when I I uh , compare proposal - two to proposal - one , ; so , ; r
Bed011_1162	Um a student rate shouldn't be very high . ; So , if we all decide it 's a good idea for you to go then you 'll we 'll pay for it . ; Right . ; Sure .
Bed014_547	W we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . ; Yeah . ; So I guess In the short run , let 's let 's be real clear on h what the two alternatives would be . ; OK .
Bed005_1308	Th - the th you know , there 's always a way to do that . ; It 's a just a question of ; i ; Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , uh , the probabilities or whatever .
Bmr031_651	Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they 're gonna have mikes like that too .
Bmr018_765	C ; It 's very tedious to check these . ; Mmm . ; Um , we would really need , ideally , a transcriber to time mark the you know , the be at least the beginning and s ends of contiguous speech .
Bdb001_661	You would just have a r ; S ; or do you say this is part of this ? ; I think
Btr002_1271	Mm - hmm . ; and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said , ; and then you would listen to it , ; and everyth the j
Bmr002_1383	I see . ; So . ; Interesting . ; Very interesting .
Btr002_1281	And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh , very very good results . ; Right . ; Good . ; Oh wow .
Bro010_541	So , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really . ; But , uh I mean you can do it with a smaller amount ; but it 's pretty rough . ; And , um , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .
Bmr006_530	It 's Abbott , so it just But it 's it 's a lot of data . ; Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? ; Tape . ; Tape ?
Bmr019_41	Right . ; Yeah , I mean , it was ; Yeah , it 's forced alignment of people 's schedules . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1277	Mm - hmm . ; I I can check on that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1500	Mm - hmm . ; But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's really bad .
Bro005_275	This is the w well , but this is without on - line normalization . ; Right ? ; Oh , this the eighty - two . ; Yeah .
Bro018_797	Uh . No actually I was going a different ; That 's a good question , too , ; but I was gonna ask about the the um changes to the data in comparing PLP and mel cepstrum for the SRI system . ; Uh .
Bmr003_1428	Cool . ; They thought about ; Hmm . ; and also it 'll go around the c the , uh ,
Bmr024_202	We can we can ignore it when we get it back , ; huh . ; and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1127	Thanks . ; Please give me one . ; Ah , we need one more over here . ; OK , maybe there 's not enough for everybody .
Bed002_1021	Right . ; So , how should What 's the uh , plan ? ; Like , how should we go about figuring out these ; OK . So , first of all is ,
Bro003_1836	Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; There 's ,
Bns001_72	Miguel Sanchez . ; I believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time ; Hi . ; and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime .
Bmr027_618	But , you know , hopefully we won't need to . ; I d I just don't think we will . ; Alright . ; For all the reasons that we 've discussed .
Bro023_1388	If if there 's another part of the system that causes a latency of a hundred milliseconds , is this an additive thing ? ; Or c or is yours hidden in that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; No ,
Bmr016_1286	Yeah . ; Yeah , and this gets substituted here . ; But in the middle two Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ? ; They 're impulsive .
Bro004_95	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem works pretty well . ; And uh actually we have uh ,
Btr001_1717	Hmm . ; I usually take out ; um , I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they 're laughs . ; I usually don't transcribe the the inbreaths or things like that .
Bsr001_693	Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it ; and I think ; Mm - hmm . ; maybe I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue .
Btr002_1176	Exactly , exactly . ; I I I could get used to I could get used to it too . ; Yeah , I could get used to it too . ; OK .
Bmr011_793	OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus . ; We spoke for an hour and a half ; Hmm . ; and , um , had an awful lot of things in common .
Bro013_241	It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's , you know it 's it 's high . ; Um . Why is it uh four times as high , or more ?
Bmr011_137	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . ; Yeah .
Bed014_944	So . ; Well , if one sort of thing is , this room is taken at after three - thirty pr pretty much every day ; by the data collection . ; Oh .
Bro027_679	Yeah , the LDA LDA we don't know , is , like is it very crucial for the features , right ? ; No . ; I just ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1935	No . ; Oh , you haven't ! ; I 'm not we we Oh , and you haven't done this either . ; OK .
Btr002_3189	Oh yeah . ; But if it 's p uh , part on these little fragments , no . ; I always ; I often transcribe that as " or " .
Bro026_1064	Mm - hmm . ; W I don't know . ; Anyway , that 's ; I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level .
Btr001_355	Right . ; Yeah . ; Which was you know , you could predict it , ; He
Bed011_240	Bigger ; Y yeah thi well this is a question for ; And that way you get the speech data of people saying " zoo " over and over again or whatever too . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1111	And at that point I discovered certain things ; like , um , " accommodate " with one " M " , ; that kind of thing . ; And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file ,
Bro003_989	and we know we have programs that compute PLP , ; we have MSG , ; we have JRA ; you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen ,
Bmr025_41	So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those ; rather than use the ones that are there . ; OK . ; Um and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made .
Bro004_1178	Yeah . Yeah . ; Um . ; I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this . ; But it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's I I
Bro005_507	Little bit better ? ; yeah . ; Slightly better . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1145	that are relevant . ; I think that starts to There 's definitely some clear cases , ; I see . ; but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting ,
Bed004_229	So i if ; Yeah , I agree , ; she sounded fine , ; she a actually was uh , more uh , present and stuff than than she was in conversation ,
Bmr026_753	and I 'd you know , where do we go from here kind of things and ; So , it would be good . ; Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the uh the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best ; you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .
Bmr020_1655	But ; Well good . ; but uh ; That that really simplifies thing then .
Bmr022_1029	Yeah . So , is is Bluetooth the sort of thing that 'd be , uh ; But . ; Uh , Bluetooth is shorter range , ; but you could use Bluetooth .
Bmr026_1215	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 'll have a very tiny effect .
Btr001_1432	Oh ! ; uh , they hear them separately in two chunks , ; but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is . ; Uh - huh .
Bro024_989	So ; So I got actually just the results for the Italian for that ; and that 's like ; So the fifty - one point O nine has become forty - eight point O six ,
Bns002_695	But , again , we can assume that eh if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen . ; OK ? ; So the point we ha what we have done is to present a mechanism would pr which provides uh one uh value for a given uh mmm probability . ; OK ?
Bro023_93	that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like ; And , um , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . ; So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , ; but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ?
Bmr022_649	I mean , that that 's how we found a lot of problems before , with , um , words being on the wrong place or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; So a failed alignment is a very good indicator that that the words don't match up . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_61	So , the syntax trees are very simple . ; It 's like most of the sentences in one tree , ; Mm - hmm . ; and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those .
Bmr028_527	Thilo , you wanna talk about recognition ? ; I was away for a couple of days . ; So . ; I haven't done a
Bmr013_334	Yeah . ; Right , ; so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , ; Yeah .
Bro017_1213	Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered , ; right ? ; but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1769	Confidence or something like that . ; Yeah , ; and the fact that I 'm , you know the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_1053	Yeah . ; M to the fourth . ; Should we do the digits ? ; Yep , go for it .
Bmr015_913	Yeah . ; I I I not sure . ; I I I try to to ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1079	But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr003_1641	No one 's talking . ; ye s Oh . ; Silence all around . ; Yep .
Bed004_635	and can we c you know , clean this this up to the point where it ; So what we really wanna do i ; cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it expand it out into more layers basically ? ; Right .
Bro005_1270	Yeah . ; OK . ; So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get ; There 'd be some point where you say , " OK , this is their version - one " or whatever ,
Buw001_2267	That is , I I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today . ; So that 's what really impressed me . ; How are we gonna find that in the data ? ; Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time
Bro026_534	Yeah . ; And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . And then , uh , improving the VAD . ; Uh . ; So , I 'll , um I 'll actually after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case .
Bed002_1168	Could happen . ; Yeah . So in terms of of the , um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . ; You don't You know , you don't really like it . ; So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages .
Bed002_1069	that are contained in the data , ; um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features ; and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . ; And and that altogether could also be uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it .
Bmr016_1123	So you 're doing these So the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation ; and they do their pass over it . ; Yes . ; And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you ,
Bmr015_1142	That 's what they 've been doing . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So , within an overlap segment , they they do this .
Bmr024_24	What 's SmartKom ? ; SmartKom ? ; Uh , we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus . ; The data .
Bed004_189	There 's no female equivalent of ; Are you sure ? ; No , I don't know . ; Not that I know of .
Bmr018_779	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't . ; Right , exactly .
Bmr012_1304	OK . ; And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John John Fiscus visit tomorrow . ; And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one ; that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes
Bns002_1306	So , despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still ; In fact in fact Bluetooth is also designed ; within one one area . ; Yeah .
Bro013_529	Yeah . ; Not pre - emphasis . ; Nothing . ; Yeah so it 's
Bro004_1136	Before ; It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . ; There 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1041	Uh , ; I , you know ; There are no final ; I mean , the official decisions I guess have to be made in terms of resources to that .
Bro013_614	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; This is a separate thing . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1003	So this is like , uh , you know , touch , ; Y ; or ; Sorry .
Bed002_465	OK ? ; And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? ; Or is there a focus on the path ? ; or something .
Bro010_182	Which there is there 's some discussion of . ; But ; What were they thinking of changing it to ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2571	from volume . ; Yeah . ; That 's interesting . ; For volume , it 's a point source pretty much ,
Bmr003_1190	Yeah , I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard ; Six . ; but there is a standard pay scale ; I just don't know what it is .
Bed015_2054	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; So that 's wonderful . ; Great .
Btr002_2186	Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation , ; and other things like that . ; Right . ; And you get so much more aware of all of it too .
Bmr029_946	Is he gone now ? ; Uh ; No . He 's just gone to a SmartKom workshop . ; Oh . Oh , oh . Oh , OK .
Bmr030_450	Line - out into the line - in on a tape player , ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yep .
Bdb001_1128	No , I d ; I mean , it doesn't . ; I mean , that not for the topic of this meeting . ; But let me just
Bed012_832	That 's good . ; I worry about you . ; I appreciate that . ; But , when you abbreviate yourself as the " Basman " , you don't use any H 's .
Bro019_1495	So a two bedroom cardboard box . ; Th - that 's great . ; yeah ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr005_1197	or strong ; We had some good ones earlier . ; There 's laughter , ; um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings ,
Buw001_59	Whoops . ; Sort of it ; you know . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1730	Yeah , it 's Absolutely . ; Yeah , it 's an it 's an evidential . ; It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . ; People have talked about it this way .
Bro017_986	Yeah . ; No , ; No . No . ; that 's right .
Bro025_97	And , uh , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me ; because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ? ; And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . ; And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra .
Bmr006_1820	Discourse . ; Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . ; Yeah , ab absolutely . ; It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved ,
Btr002_1656	M yeah , the ones that where they 're talking about linguistic things , though , are great . ; Yeah . ; I ; I love those .
Bmr003_1086	There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents . ; Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour . ; And who ; who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ?
Btr002_1974	and and he says something ; and Dan says , " No " . ; And it sounds like he 's saying " no " to Adam , ; and it was w if if if so , this would have been extremely rude .
Bro024_513	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and in that twenty percent @ @ it 's very inconsistent across different noise conditions .
Bmr003_1469	right ? ; Well , yeah , ; what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @ ; Yep .
Bed010_317	Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . ; Right ? ; That is So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , ; and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .
