Bmr025_237	s	What I ; But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . ; Yeah , right . ; If he has then you learn ,
Bmr031_855	ba	Oh . ; the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed ; we 've got twenty - six hours that are finished being transcribed . ; Oh ! Great .
Bdb001_590	s	Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ? ; Um ; And so so this one would have , um , an ID is link link seventy - four or something like that . ; And then somewhere up here you would have a link that that , uh , you know , was referencing L - seventy - four and had speaker Adam .
Bmr010_1342	s	I I I think that , eh , the possibility , eh , can be that , eh , ; Thilo , eh , working , eh , with a new class , ; Mm - hmm . ; not only , eh , nonspeech and speech , but , eh , in in in the speech class ,
Bmr028_1149	qo	Wow . Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; So if you run er , your recognizer with all probabilities equal , what do you get out ?
Bmr013_593	ba	Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system doesn't work at all . ; So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , ; Right . ; so , that 's that 's great for for my purpose .
Bmr013_275	b	Place of ar place of articulation . ; Place , place . ; Place . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_663	b	But it if Suppose we get one or two errors , still , per you know , per transcript , then we z we might wanna try some approach like that . ; Well , the numbered ones would make it a lot easier , ; cuz you could then really localize where the error is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_407	aa	Not very quickly . ; The problem is that that the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms . ; You can but it takes time . ; That 's it .
Bed008_555	%--	it 's the endpoint ; Gotcha , yeah . ; let 's say underbar - U , ; so that 's the endpoint decision uh as seen through the
Bro022_946	s	So that 's always there . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , actually if I don't maybe don't want to work too much of on it right now .
Bmr024_833	s	yeah , ; i is cheap . ; I mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . ; If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much .
Bro004_798	s	uh So basically it 's almost binary decisions ; and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . ; Oh no , ; but it would still be even more of a binary decision .
Btr001_2339	s	Mmm . ; And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that . ; There 's some there 's something there about ; you know , you you make a joke
Bro014_147	s	I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is ; but I can I can send email around about it . ; Yeah . ; And so we 've got it
Bmr003_1365	b	And they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development ; and I said , well , maybe . ; Good . ; Right .
Bed003_1496	no	It 's not like German trains . ; Like German trains are really great ; so . ; But you know , I don't know whether it 's which ones are safer , you know , statistically .
Bro017_830	qw	right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Because you would be providing severe mismatch . ; But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ?
Bmr001_431	qw	um but um ; Yeah . ; OK , that is a bit more than I thought . ; How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space
Bmr019_465	bk	I mean ; Oh , no , no . ; It 's tha that that we were saying , you know , well is how much worse is far than near , you know . ; Oh , th OK .
Bmr026_423	s	Right . ; On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . ; It 's ; But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there
Bmr021_888	%--	So that would actually be the more interesting experiment . ; Um , the other thing is I 'm training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models ; Right . ; and then we can
Bmr022_358	s	There 'd be some kind of mark in front of it . ; Interesting . ; Well , cuz they 're s distinguishing between twenty - three ; that 's your indicator there , and twenty - three that somebody happens to say in a meeting .
Bmr018_715	s	so we you know , we had spent a lot of time , um , writing up the HLT paper ; and we wanted to use that , uh , kind of analysis , ; Yeah . ; but the HLT paper has , you know , it 's a very crude measure of overlap .
Bsr001_942	b	Well ; and they , it 's a lot clean . ; Like ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1072	qrr	Well but i ; Sort of given up guessing . ; But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? ; Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got
Bro026_114	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Cool .
Bmr021_307	s	Uh , yeah , but it does it s it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently . ; Yeah . ; Well , OK , you mean it 's built into the SRI , ; because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools .
Bmr030_499	s	and I change the status to " Trans - IP IBM " , ; so that , you know , when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those . ; And , um ; So I 'm not picking huge chunks , right now , of meetings for them ,
Bmr012_1307	s	that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes ; but to be basically in three parts , ; the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects ; um other things
Bro018_828	b	OK . ; to see if maybe there was a um a certain type of compression or something that was done that my script wasn't catching . ; So that for some subset of the training data , uh the the the features I was computing were junk . ; OK .
Bmr016_432	s	O . That 's not bad . ; No , I can do it . ; A and that prosody was great , by the way . ; I couldn't understand a single thing you guys were saying .
Bro023_699	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , uh , you know . ; So why did you choose , uh , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ? ; Uh , the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach .
Bro012_658	s	Mm - hmm . ; so maybe if I can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it 's you know , as easy to do as possible ; and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work , ; then maybe that would be good .
Bed005_404	aa	there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , ; Right . ; like the n s " Discourse Status Confirm " . ; Yep .
Bed015_330	s	Mm - hmm . ; cuz we know verb meets its object . ; And then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have " the " preceding a noun . ; And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum .
Btr002_634	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that 's what it seems like . ; Yeah . Yeah , I do too . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_290	bk	And that 's just amazingly helpful . ; Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . ; Oh , right . ; I see what you mean .
Bro018_657	aa	Yeah , ; and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing ? ; And didn't they like exponentiate or something ; Um Yeah ,
Bro021_263	s	Oh . ; But ; Yeah . ; So , but in this case I I really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of features , they are very different .
Bmr024_442	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring . ; Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring .
Bmr005_872	ba	Yeah . I mean , you you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close . ; That was with zero literature search . ; And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it . ; That 's good validation .
Bed010_943	%	And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft . ; OK . ; So , de Uh . And her name is Eva . ; OK .
Btr001_976	s	that there are those known variants , and ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Or " a " versus " a " .
Bmr009_808	s	On on the new one , Time comes first and then Date , ; but I thought ; Oh you mean on the digit form ? ; This is this is rather a low level question , but but it used used to be Date came first .
Bmr024_224	b	I dunno . ; He didn't even reply to my message . ; So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it . ; Alright .
Btr002_1529	b	Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out . ; Yeah . I ; Right . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1366	b	W we just need to start somewhere . ; Yeah , and this is a starting point . ; The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now ; Uh - huh .
Bsr001_1781	%--	Hmm ? ; OK , but you have to put on a You have to put on a mike . ; So so , clear ; I think we 've run it
Bed010_224	s	OK . ; and I can sort of walk f through the information . ; So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . ; Just fun .
Bmr023_555	%--	then it becomes ; That it was the transcrip ; He wanted to do a web interface that would make it ; Well , if it 's just the audio
Bmr023_442	ba	But , it will be possible in the future ; Yeah . ; because we we 're , um . ; Mmm , that 's great .
Bmr003_1853	ar	w What ; OK . ; You 're the one who raised the issue . ; No .
Bro004_62	s	Excuse me . ; The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian .
Bmr010_1134	s	Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , you know , and I also thought , y Liz has this , eh , you know , and I do also , this this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved . ; These people would be great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted , ; We 'd have to mark them .
Buw001_1494	%--	Well , we 're gonna ; So you need to have some sort of ; if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the ; you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha
Bed005_1125	s	And Uh ; One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? " ; Yeah , it 's a good question . ; Um The so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions .
Bmr015_741	b	the errors of peaks the frequency peaks , eh , eh , move around these , eh eh frequency harmonic ; the frequency of the harmonic . ; And , eh , if you if you compare the the instantaneous frequency , eh , of the of the , eh , continuous , eh , eh , filters , that , eh that , eh , they used eh , to to to get , eh , the the instantaneous frequency , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_189	ba	Yeah right . ; No . ; Student discount . ; Yeah , good mikes are expensive .
Bro012_519	b	If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah that 's th ; Yeah .
Bro004_208	h	I I I meant something different by baseline ; Yeah . ; So let me let me ; Um , so , um
Bmr031_1062	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so I was thinking about why that was ; and the data structures I would use , ; and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it .
Bmr010_95	s	Yeah . ; And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um , ; w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue , ; uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before
Bmr031_1693	d	I still don't know if these are gonna be any good ; but it sure does get us out of here quicker . ; A one , and a two , and a three . ; Ready ?
Bmr018_943	d	I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly , ; Yeah , or ; because you have to , uh , maneuver around on the on both windows then . ; To add or to delete ?
Bed003_1658	bk	so I had to reboot ; Oh , no . ; And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network . ; Uh
Bmr008_153	s	But then that 's interfering with the meeting . ; So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once , and they fill it out once , ; and and then you have that information . ; well , and we also discussed the idea of having the separate D T Ds would handle maybe , s specific meeting - specific things that might be relevant .
Bmr023_963	s	which is another old old bug of mine . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , um ; Um . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz
Bro026_344	s	Uh , we are between their two systems . ; Oh , are we ? ; So ; I It is a triumph .
Bed010_657	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1842	s	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; It just occurred to me , ; this is a a different kind of question ,
Bmr005_471	x	Alright . ; Not speech not speech or too much speech . ; in the per ; Too much speech .
Bmr002_728	b	but ; Well I know that I know that um the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce does not come out in STM format . ; on our speaker phones . ; Right .
Btr001_1593	bh	I guess I 'm such a perfectionist that I sort of combine the two when I 'm checking , ; like I act as though I 'm transcribing it . ; Mmm . ; Really ?
Bro027_77	aa	Mmm . ; It 's actually set to zero ? ; What kind of filter is that ? ; Yeah .
Bro027_1601	bk	At the input of the neural net you have this , uh , f nine frames of context plus the delta . ; Well , w i ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , plus the delta ,
Bro013_287	%--	I mean . I don't think uh ; I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , ; but I don't think that uh the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits . ; I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get
Bmr007_820	s	Say that again ? ; Frame over fres threshold . ; So you take a each frame , and you compute the energy ; and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones .
Bmr011_1806	b	but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . ; And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_499	%--	OK . ; Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes , ; and then , uh , in order to ; The the other difference that we 'd have to take care of is that ,
Bmr020_1095	b	In any case , this this uh , meeting that I hand ; I I hand - adjusted two of them ; I mentioned before , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1190	s	And the LDA introduces delays , ; and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path ; so that it doesn't introduce uh , any more delay . ; I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay
Bmr012_968	b	Cuz I was thinking you know if if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know ; um and this came up talking to to Jerry also ; that you know is there any way for them to indicate to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow ; Yeah .
Bmr005_732	bk	Yeah . ; Whereas th i I would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bsr001_233	qw	Oh yeah . ; otherwise my ear channels , ; That would give you a headache . ; What happened ?
Bed014_715	%--	What uh , what 's the argument for putting it in the construction ? ; Is it just that the s synonym selection is better , or ? ; Oh , wel Well , the ar the The argument is that you 're gonna have the ; If you 've recognized the word ,
Bro022_209	%--	which is the time trajectory of energy , ; um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . ; And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . ; You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in
Bed014_315	aa	Huh ? ; Yeah , it 's hard . ; It 's a hard puzzle . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1566	bk	Not easily . ; I mean y yes we could do that . ; You could you can write widgets in C . ; Yeah .
Bed003_104	%--	and this i we actually have a separate feature ; but I decided to put it on the same line for space . ; " Nice walls " which we can look up ; because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode ,
Bro014_938	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; but it 's more that , you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data ; Right .
Bmr010_502	b	Fantastic . ; So . ; Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_55	s	But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . ; Technical stuff we 'll do uh another day . ; Probably next week . ; But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them .
Bro025_94	s	you know , what 's the ideal filtering , ; and depending on how you construct the problem . ; Uh - huh . ; And , uh , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me
Bmr006_970	b	Yeah . ; in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what uh ; And ; Right .
Bmr002_376	b	However , if we have a transcribing machine I would accept it . ; The other thing is , you know , having getting hold of a transcriber . ; I think that CogSci has one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_612	%--	Oh , right . Oh , that 's ; The longer is better . ; It 's just when there is when they are sequentially and ; There 's there 's th
Bed010_403	b	I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code . ; No , ; he 's not gonna do that . ; Yeah .
Bed014_514	bk	I mean , there there 's some that ; Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one . ; You can't do that either . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_429	s	Well ; and we won't be using the old ones anymore . ; Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG . ; I have a lot of space , though .
Btr001_125	s	Even though I still don't know what they are . ; I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort , ; but that 's all . ; Well these here are the P Z
Bdb001_76	bk	I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was , ; Oh , I remember seeing an example of this . ; but it ; Right ,
Bmr016_706	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , ; but using um , you know , more than energy
Bmr029_475	s	But , um ; It 's just easier to do . ; Well , in the new test , actually , that 's not true . ; So Again , if this if these new segmentations work OK , then we then it 's a fair it 's a completely fair test .
Bed002_839	bk	OK . ; Two - D . ; So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the for themselves ; Yeah .
Bed013_848	s	Oh , god , I hope not . ; What ? ; You guys are too young . ; You know like " Sussudio " ,
Bed008_538	co	The old one was not that not that important , I think ; but ; OK , well , not a big deal then . ; Let 's do it then .
Bmr018_1206	s	Yeah . ; OK , ; Cuz , I 'm just thinking , you know , we were we 're we 've been talking about changing the mikes , uh , for a while , ; see ya .
Bro010_1214	b	we should try t to ; He 's working on this , ; on trying to ; Yeah .
Bro004_772	bk	it 's true for a tandem system . ; So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . ; Yeah . ; OK ?
Btr002_2528	b	What about transcribing it that way , ; " Hmph . " ; like " hmph " ? ; Hmm !
Bro013_485	aa	This is for clean and this is for noise . ; Oh . ; There 's two things on the same graph . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_106	bk	OK . ; I see . ; Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . ; I see .
Bmr013_893	s	And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , ; and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , ; but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . ; And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel ,
Bmr031_695	s	Yeah , we 're using those for the for the expanded . ; So , for example , the , uh Guenter 's Wall Street Journal data went onto one of those , ; Uh - huh . ; uh , some other experiment things that people are doing are on there ,
Bmr026_1049	no	I mean should should we even use that ? ; Oh oh that 's a good question . ; Or should I just go straight to ; Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer
Bmr031_1427	s	And that 's the same task that Mari , a um , a student named Dustin , and also Sarah who was at this last meeting will be looking into doing from the language modeling side . ; Maybe some kind of clu you know , clustered class N - gram or something . ; Uh - huh . ; Um . And also we 're we 're using a couple of the labellers who are doing emotion to help us , um , finalize some transcripts for this .
Bro007_545	b	oh , but uh we don't have time . ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_940	b	Yeah , I ; Yeah . ; So , " highly mismatched condition " means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test . ; Uh - huh .
Bed013_108	s	Well , once the system understands things . ; Yeah . No problem . ; I just don't think I think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things . ; Yeah . Well , if we can get it to understand one thing , like our " where is " run through we can also , maybe , e make it say , or ask " where is X ? " Or not .
Bed013_236	%--	Cuz you have to query the node , for every a uh , or query the net two to the twenty times . ; Sure . ; Alright . ; Or not two to th
Bed014_1294	%--	Yeah . ; Right . ; OK . ; But in a sense , it 's good to know that he of all people
Bro016_815	aa	Right ? ; They 're sort of the pre - nonlinearity values ? ; Right . ; Yes .
Bmr016_1415	%--	yeah . ; Ah ! ; Uh , ; So , Jane , what 's the d
Bmr016_1832	s	Yep . ; " ICSI " is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say " ICSI . " ; Mm - hmm . ; So , those that are l are listed in the acronyms , I actually know
Bro014_1088	aa	No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies . ; Well , it 's just ; So this is uh , basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1122	qy	Yeah . ; And so that was one suggestion . ; Well , I mean , ; so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?
Buw001_419	aa	Mm - hmm . ; And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr016_827	no	Probably , yeah . ; But um , ; That 's typical , huh . ; yeah , I don't know what 's typical here ,
Bmr003_2090	bk	And then the , uh would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time . ; Uh , so this this notion of putting down the P Z Ms and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table ; or or ; Right .
Bro004_401	s	Yeah , ; you you do have to be careful ; because of com compounded results . ; I think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another
Bed002_728	%--	Was it is it the one that you showed in your talk ? ; Like people ; No , no . ; But
Btr002_560	b	raspy , I mean , ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_1035	s	definitely s so Absolutely . ; Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that . ; OK . ; I mean , I I 'm I 'm interested in it ,
Bsr001_2159	%--	That 's alright . ; He 's allowed to speak , ; He can talk anyway . ; he ca
Bmr019_1152	b	Yeah . ; And ma maybe maybe Chafe did . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_633	s	So that 's an ; Um ; Or ; Because you know I Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two .
Bmr020_745	s	Is that a dash or a dot in there ? ; I mean you can ; Don't don't don't say . ; Dash .
Bmr007_111	no	Mm - hmm . ; At the very end , this is when people were , you know , packing up to go basically , ; there 's this final stuff , ; I think we I don't remember where the digits fell .
Bro003_628	aa	Yeah . Yeah . ; and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_451	s	But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's ; Yeah , but ; Yeah . ; But that can include taps .
Bro004_741	s	because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . ; But the way the feature gives The the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data ; I di ; but this is not the case for another kind of data .
Bmr012_187	%	there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh ; I 'm we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . ; Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually ; Hmm .
Bro022_201	s	Um , ; uh , ; if you ; if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values ,
Bmr007_510	s	Actually , I think I 've done it a fair number of times today . ; But . ; Yeah . ; There 's a lot of head - nodding , in this
Bdb001_167	qw	I would use just an existing an existing way of doing it . ; Why ; Mmm . ; But but why not use it for phone - level ?
Bed013_1274	bk	so let 's just assume ; For the subset of ; human beings are not allowed to ask anything but " where is X " . ; OK .
Bro021_1114	b	Yeah . ; This is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s Taylor series . ; Yeah , sure . ; Right .
Buw001_351	s	Does it ? ; Well , see , there are th ; Well , yeah . ; I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah .
Bmr022_595	s	You 'll get back another offset . ; Um I mean , I was thinking of ; then I and then I realized " Well , the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps , ; and then there 'll be all the extra beeps at the end
Bro016_652	%--	But as far as , ; I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back . ; Maybe other people did too . ; With with , uh , uh , l trying to identify third formant average third formant using that as an indicator of
Bro005_105	%	And training the net on French only ; and Spanish only ; and testing on , uh TI - digits . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_1019	cc	I just , um , continuing looking at , uh , ph uh , phonetic events , ; and , uh , this Tuesday gonna be , uh , meeting with John Ohala with Chuck to talk some more about these , uh , ph um , phonetic events . ; Um , came up with , uh , a plan of attack , ; uh , gonna execute ,
Bed014_1256	%--	because I mean , I wo I w scientifically worked on that for for almost two years . ; Yeah . ; OK , then certainly we will . ; Yeah , you should definitely , um be on on that
Bmr028_637	s	No . ; So so , I guess Don would need your help to to create a new set of split , uh , meetings . ; Sure . ; You know , you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times ,
Bro004_878	%--	But We can ; know soon . ; Maybe . ; but but
Bed003_743	t1	But yes , ; you can set it to un " unknown " . ; And if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same , ; Oops .
Bmr018_1667	s	and then that 's it for the r for all of time . ; I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it these these things matters matter . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; So , I mean , this was a very provocative slide .
Bed006_1196	s	And um how how where is the end ? ; So that 's ; No , no . ; There a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that ,
Bro017_822	aa	that would be a severe mismatch , ; right ? ; what you are proposing ? ; Yeah ,
Btr002_2755	s	Yes ! ; Oh really ? ; That 's true . ; Oh , I always get I always get " breath " .
Bed009_942	%--	Cuz I r I didn't reme I didn't think I saw it . ; Have we looked at the German ? ; Yeah ; Oh , I haven
Bmr007_1153	s	Mm - hmm . ; I I don't want to make this twice it 's length but but you know , just im improve it . ; Um Is there anything anybody ; I I did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits .
Bmr001_509	s	Yeah . ; I 'll send mail to speech local . ; Pardon ? ; I 'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone 's still using it .
Bmr010_472	%--	Yeah . ; I don't know if , ; uh , ; uh , we wanna ,
Bro004_603	s	no , ; the third part , ; so it 's uh highly mismatched . ; So . Training and test noise are different .
Bed006_1148	b	Yeah . ; which is direct . ; Well there there there should never be a hard coded uh shortcut from the bakery question to the uh double schema thing , ; Right .
Bro019_1462	bk	So you 're not down here permanently yet ? ; No . ; I 'm going back to OGI today . ; Ah !
Bmr024_1511	s	Right . ; And , the result in the end was no different . ; Right . ; So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models .
Bed011_1019	b	Set up the infrastructure , ; Right . ; It 's only popula ; yeah .
Bro027_1033	s	I know what I was gonna say . ; Um , not no relation . ; No relation . ; So I I I don't understand ,
Bmr020_374	s	and and we think that based on that , we think that the results are you know , valid , ; although of course , some error is gonna be in there . ; But basically what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost uh , the level of the non - overlapped speech . ; So that means that even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , uh , the recognizer does a good job ,
Bro012_1151	s	When you have noise there is no ; um if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech ; and . ; Yeah , you can make these mistakes ,
Bed006_307	s	IE the first with that new setup tomorrow at two ; and we have a real interesting subject which is Ron Kay ; for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ICI . ; So he 'll he 's around seven seventy years old , or something .
Bro012_1413	s	but I don't know . ; If this voicing bit doesn't help , uh , I think we don't have to to work more about this ; because ; Uh . It 's just to know if it how much i it will help
Bro028_185	b	And , um ; So it looked strange ; and then just using the the other silence probability helps . ; Mmm .
Bro021_1155	s	Sometimes it is ; and sometimes it 's not . ; Yeah . ; I the clean speech the codebook for clean speech , I am using TIMIT .
Bmr007_197	%--	So , um Then it beco though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . ; So , uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now ; and , um um , anticipating the end of a question and simply answering it earlier , ; and there are several of those in this in these data where
Bed002_720	%--	No , you you will not have , ; and there it is , ; and , uh ; But you know , y y
Bro027_40	s	Yeah . ; Um ; And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too . ; Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at OGI .
Bro003_1807	bs	So , uh . ; So I think ; Yeah . ; So wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing .
Bmr002_1171	aa	so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh , far - field mikes ; Right . ; cuz what we that 's the problem we 're trying to solve . ; Right .
Bdb001_307	d	Hmm . ; But it 's still a lot tighter than than ASCII . ; And we have a lot of tools already to deal with it . ; You do ?
Bro025_707	%--	Ye ; I think you can you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech . ; But we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place . ; So , it 's
Btr001_303	aa	Yeah . ; Oh OK . ; I think so , ; yeah .
Bmr003_1854	bk	OK . ; You 're the one who raised the issue . ; No . ; Alright ,
Bro018_1151	b	or it wa a it was around one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I think it was getting around one percent for the near for the n for the close mike . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_871	ba	my understanding was that , ; um ; I haven't I haven't listened to it yet , ; but it sounded very good
Bmr024_513	cc	do those actually go down or not ? ; Because of ; Yeah . ; I 'll can make an can , like , make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one ,
Bed013_472	s	And the keynote speakers are Tomasello , MacWhinney ? ; We - MacWhinney , I think . ; Whinney . MacWhinney. Uh - huh . ; So , interesting , both , like , child language people .
Bmr001_186	s	And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of There are like three connectors in the circuit . ; The thing is , like , it 's it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop . ; So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one . ; um And I 'm still not sure .
Bmr020_916	b	So that is the training meeting . ; Yeah , ; w and we know that . ; OK .
Bmr019_333	%	Bell Digits . ; Alright . ; By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting . ; Um .
Bro005_1300	s	I I don't know . ; I think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . ; I think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing we can we e e ; What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things ,
Bro016_984	b	Hmm . Yeah . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_888	b	And , uh . ; No . ; We 've also , uh , s done some of that as , uh , eh , ; Right .
Bmr025_949	%--	That 's why we have this little ; I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone ; but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it ; and so if we don't have to return it
Bmr025_581	b	y yeah . ; Well I 'll turn off the screensaver too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_721	s	or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ? ; I delete the old one , put the new one in . ; Oh , OK . ; There 's nothing left of the original signal .
Bns002_1475	s	That 's uh my point , and my picture I have in mind . ; And I will go definitely back to Germany the tenth of December . ; That is fixed now . ; And I hope we can use these remaining weeks to have really progress in uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before .
Bmr023_97	b	I know that . ; So . ; But , you know , which opportunity should we ; Yeah .
Bmr010_898	%--	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you could you could say well , let
Bsr001_2192	s	I mean , there is no LDC database . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; There is , at least we have to share the data , I mean .
Bmr027_31	%--	and now we have two . ; So . And , uh . ; OK . ; So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week ,
Bmr022_1231	%--	And if they all do , then there isn't a problem , ; right ? ; Cuz once they give us the data , it 's ours , ; and if they wanna make changes
Bsr001_751	s	Yeah , it 's not ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power .
Bmr011_525	s	Right , ; And and the acoustic people will always say , " well are you doing , uh , uh , array microphones ? " ; right . ; So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .
Buw001_1117	s	It was like , " what 's going on ? " ; Yeah . ; the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? ; We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ?
Bed015_381	aa	Yeah . ; OK , so that 's ; But there does basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ? ; Right .
Bro017_749	s	You 're multiplying the standard deviation ? ; So it 's ; I think that you multiply the ; I would I would have to look in the in the math ,
Bmr009_976	b	Yeah . ; Actually even if you t ; But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_904	b	If you have , eh uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh only consider , eh like candidate , the , nnn , eh the silence , because it is the the only model , eh eh , he used that , eh eh nnn , to detect the the possibility of a a change between the between the speaker , ; Right . ; Um another another research thing , different groups , eh working , eh on Broadcast News prefer to , eh to consider hypothesis eh between each phoneme . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_373	co	Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So let 's do this . ; Let 's plan next Monday , OK , to have a review of what we have so far .
Bro026_725	s	When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? ; Um , I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there . ; Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? ; Yeah , it 's already there .
Bmr001_626	h	You just can't listen . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Um .
Bmr015_276	aa	I see . ; Yeah so O OK . Well , anyway , I guess everybody here Are y are ; you are on that list , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_56	%--	Oh , there 's Hold on . ; which ; um , so there 're a couple of examples . ; I have one in front of you which is the one where ,
Bdb001_282	bk	I mean , I 've I 've used them . ; but ; I don't know what their structure is . ; OK .
Bro017_1196	b	Uh - huh . ; Maybe we should set that up . ; That would make it much easier . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_726	t3	OK . ; The the o the other issue that you had was , how do you actually efficiently extract , um find and extract information in a structure of this type ? ; So . ; That 's good .
Bed014_182	s	It is Uh , we have the choice between the , uh , usual Festival voices , ; which I already told the SmartKom people we aren't gonna use because they 're really bad . ; Festival ? ; It 's the name of some program ,
Bmr028_377	ba	and Um , ; and I didn't hear back . ; So I thought " OK . It 's probably too hard . ; He 's overloaded .
Bmr010_44	%--	Yeah , well . ; OK . ; Uh ; We talk about the the results of
Bed015_1517	%--	Right , right . ; and not " they , " whoever they are . ; So ; Or " you "
Bed014_1231	bk	Right . Right . No . Of course . ; Mmm . ; that that the logicians have have , uh ; That 's right .
Bed002_1365	%	I first thought it had something to do with the material ; that it w that 's why I asked . ; That 's right , OK . ; Mmm .
Bro014_827	%--	we ; The variance of the spectrum of excitation . ; Yeah . ; So the
Bmr021_238	s	That 's causing problems , ; yeah . ; Which one is the Andrea mike ? ; It was over here sometimes .
Bmr006_1370	b	Whatever you 're interested in . ; Yeah . ; That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? ; Yeah .
Bro017_1176	s	Yeah . ; What you know , nowadays , ; yeah . ; It 's actually do - able , almost .
Bmr028_102	t3	If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what Transcriber does , is it computes a another thing to display based on the waveform . ; We 're talking about We 're talking about that demo .
Bmr031_1523	s	So . Go ahead , Jeremy . ; Right . So I 've been looking at spectral tilt ; and different ways of perhaps generating it . ; And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh we 're gonna look at for features .
Bmr009_579	bk	It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_126	bk	Oh . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Oh .
Bns001_1707	qy	but there is no net . ; If you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end IP available , that could be a vision . ; Like . ; Can you repeat it ?
Bmr008_888	b	not where you live . ; I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed002_439	s	Ask them which one you want . " ; OK . ; But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do . ; But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .
Btr001_851	%--	but . ; There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of . ; Mm - hmm . ; You 're
Bed005_250	s	I had to change , @ @ " Spielfilm " to " film " , ; uh , " Film " to " movie " , ; cinem " Kino " to " cinema " ; to " today " heu " heute " to " today " ,
Bed015_1853	qy	But it ; And ; Go ahead . ; i isn't that part easy though
Bns001_1629	s	And ; They they want something pretty strange from me that I think of a service , ; a network service . ; There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day
Bmr014_5	b	So are you ; Are we going ? ; It is uh , must be February fifteenth . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1375	fa	I 'm sorry , ; I 'm sorry . ; The labels . ; I 'm sorry .
Bed009_183	qw	and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human . ; Yeah . ; and we 're setting it up so that we can we hope to implant certain intentions in people . ; For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that " How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? "
Bns002_329	%--	and I am the intermediate node to the final destination Michael . ; And Michael send also some RTS packet in the time and and uh uh uh Jordi too and whatever . ; Yeah . ; Then you will never come to a really
Bmr030_600	s	I see . ; So . ; I guess they haven't got a p ; Actually there are a few I saw a web - based one at one point .
Bsr001_2547	s	The projector is much louder than the air conditioning . ; This is the first time we 've done it with a projector . ; Yeah , ; but I was just thinking , he was showing it on what he showed us on the web site ,
Bmr014_29	bk	I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment . ; In particular , the ; well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask . ; OK audio monitoring , Jane .
Bed013_827	aa	Was that what ; Well that was related to what we were talking about . ; Should I introduce it as SUDO - square ? ; Yeah sure .
Bmr014_869	s	know it ; There was a ; one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , ; but overall people are talking about technical topics .
Btr001_167	b	I don't know . ; I liked them . ; And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there . ; Hmm .
Bmr018_1271	s	wh ; A little , ; Hang a five pound weight off the off the back . ; We did that
Bmr014_45	b	Yeah . ; Huh . ; And I don't know what the e electronics is but . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1333	s	Yeah . ; And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around ; and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . ; But that that 's gonna be very hard to generate .
Bmr008_46	s	and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time . ; So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once . ; And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form . ; so , I had a first pass of it ,
Bmr001_861	h	So , with this next ; You wanna read ? ; Sure . ; OK .
Bmr019_1810	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro021_597	s	you just doing it all with complex arithmetic ; and , uh ; and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase . ; But it looks like there 's ways that one could potentially just work with the complex numbers and and and in principle get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum .
Bro027_1544	no	Mm - hmm . ; So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know .
Bed015_1784	b	And I think And I think y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that . ; He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one . ; I r I read that paper , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_360	s	there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , ; uh , may come here , uh , in the fall for , uh , sort of a five month , uh , sabbatical . ; So he might be around . ; Get him to give some talks and so on .
Bro028_277	s	but , ; um , ; I did , like , um I did , uh , listen to the m most noisy utterances of the SpeechDat - Car Italian ; and tried to transcribe them .
Bmr029_443	s	Right . OK . ; Now there 's the issue of ; Oh , OK . So there 's the issue of speaker normalization . ; So , with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking .
Bro023_24	aa	Hmm . ; Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ? ; Is that right ? ; Yeah ,
Bed005_1009	aa	Uh ; Yeah , ; E - EVA , right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1263	s	I actually have to go . ; So . ; Alright . ; Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one .
Bsr001_1430	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; or phone meetings , ; or even
Bmr021_684	s	So that it 'll work on all the NT machines . ; Well , I mean , as it stands , I I guess ; OK . ; yeah I see what you mean .
Bro027_1315	s	until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , that 's interesting . ; It was helping , uh , if the features are b were bad ,
Bmr003_952	s	Yep . ; Yeah , yeah . ; That 's a major that 's like , one of the two things that ; I mean , there 's gonna there 's gonna be in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's it 's gonna be a bit of a problem
Bmr024_354	b	We should be able to . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_211	d	Ye - uh Yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a CallHome and a CallFriend also , ; The CallFriend is for language ind identification . ; Well , anyway , these corpus are all telephone speech . ; So , um . This could be a a problem for Why ?
Bmr014_1196	s	So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , ; phone and in person . ; Yeah . ; Or mail , physical mail .
Bro007_261	d	Yeah . ; Oh ; um so um yeah it be kind of I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually . ; The size that we have ?
Bmr006_336	co	but I mean ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; you know , each person who 's interested in I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .
Bmr003_1187	%--	Right , ; these are linguistics grad students . ; That 's right . ; Yeah , I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard
Bro018_747	%	Right , ; um to come up with a mapping from um MFCC 's or s some feature set , um to uh w to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature . ; or ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1741	s	It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear ; but I 'm not an expert . ; OK , so it 's ; It seems like a problem with cross - talk .
Bro018_520	b	Mm - hmm . ; if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more more of one . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr029_485	bd	The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both . ; Well , that 's more of a problem . ; I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of gene ; I mean you can pretend it 's all from one speaker
Bed013_168	s	And so , @ @ whatever that is , it 's the generic default intention . That it would find out . ; Which is , wanting to know where something is , ; maybe nnn and wanting ; I don't know what it 's gonna be ,
Bed006_857	s	This was in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious , ; but you can think of the Enter , View and Approach as each having their roles , ; right ? ; the I mean it 's it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching ,
Bmr023_402	cc	I mean , They 're very perceptive . ; I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . ; I haven't done it yet , but I wanna do that ; and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns .
Bro019_1035	bk	Maybe Roger ; r Roger , maybe in charge of . ; And then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to ; Yeah .
Bed014_1209	2	the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to uh , indefinite pronouns ; like " someone fixed the car " ; because lots of languages , um , have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever , ; Use actually the same one .
Bro012_1145	b	and then voiced sound are more high frequencies ; cuz it 's frication ; and ; Right .
Bmr006_1196	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; So , this is all pretty early stages . ; OK .
Bed002_1048	no	Um , ; probably that 's not worth it . ; I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it , ; but I don't know .
Bro005_1137	s	That you did have nice interpolative effects . ; That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . ; But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . ; So it was sort of behaved reasonably .
Bmr001_205	s	Well n ; Yeah . ; Jim is busy at the moment . ; That 's the problem .
Bsr001_2081	b	but ; but SRI in general is is the ; but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue . ; Yeah .
Bed002_944	s	OK . ; I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , ; but with intention um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors ; and I 'm not really sure , um , how how e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that Um , it 's ju it 's just hard .
Buw001_1539	s	Yeah . ; w Just " what would you like to know ? " ; Yeah . ; But that neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is .
Bmr018_896	b	but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution , ; Oh it 's it 's a ; so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with . ; yeah .
Bed015_614	s	Yeah , I mean ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; uh , I I mean , that that 's my feeling that that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what what 's going on .
Bmr031_1253	b	Yeah . ; You know , I 'll bet You know , Bush went on this European trip recently ; and they told him there that they get more vacations . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1385	s	Completely useless ! ; but it has some some possibility of being expanded . ; But the point is eh , the only in here The only thing wireless thing I can put on on this is just uh this Omnisky modem , ; which is uh , I think it is a subscription - based uh thing .
Bmr016_2178	b	or If they if they can ; You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_432	s	Hmm . ; and um ; Right . ; I would s I would still be willing to try it .
Btr001_1378	%--	you know , the methodology . ; How do they do this . ; Mmm . ; Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word ,
Bmr015_1089	qy	this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ; OK . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths . ; So what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically ? ; Could we get a breath detector ?
Bed010_448	co	It 's ; One is you design and the other is you learn . ; OK ? ; So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess .
Bmr011_151	2	cuz it 's a fixed boom . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Is fixed . Yeah .
Bro005_1166	s	I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in we still don't have a good explanation for this , ; but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases ; and uh the performance is getting worse ; and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better .
Bmr014_150	s	Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together ; so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . ; So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , ; possibility of six wireless receivers ,
Bro024_1316	s	It 's not . ; It 's it was trained on some alignment obtained ; um , ; uh For the Italian data , I think we trained the neural network on with embedded training .
Bro019_1010	s	you know , ; uh , ; but , w um , ; uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .
Bmr013_389	b	Right . ; That 's what I meant is ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_453	%--	OK . ; Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago ; Oh , it was . ; Oh , I shoul
Bro012_1076	s	I I don't know which which one . ; It 's Pratibha that that did this experiment . ; Yeah . ; Um . We should ask which VAD she used .
Bmr019_26	bk	OK , so there 's digits , alignments , ; and , um , ; I guess the other thing , which I came unprepared for , uh , is , uh , to dis s s see if there 's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting . ; Right .
Bdb001_259	%--	v Look at it , words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is , I don't know , five maybe ? ; but we actually ; So , look at it , t number of words times five . ; Oh , so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the
Bro017_671	b	You need like a some kind of a ; Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power . ; You need to have a genetic algorithm , that basically tries random permutations of these things . ; I know .
Bro012_537	s	Yeah . ; Uh . Do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ? ; But . ; Uh . About the same .
Bro004_1402	%--	Uh , is it about equal between the two ? ; For for Aurora ? ; For HTK ? ; For
Bsr001_1976	b	So I mean , recognition technology and also core , you know , algorithms , et cetera . ; And for those people to have these data will be , you know , the best way to , you know , develop the systems to an @ @ . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_601	s	Probably Johno . ; OK . ; Uh , take what they have , ; send it to everybody saying " this is what they have ,
Bmr015_558	s	Fine . Fine . ; So for for m the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers ; for meeting I Ds . ; Uh , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers ,
Bmr018_488	s	Yeah , hopefully , I mean ; The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized . ; So I think they should be able to hear . ; The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not .
Bro023_28	aa	Oh , OK . ; yeah . ; So I guess I should probably talk to him a bit too ? ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr014_1070	no	See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can . ; It 's just a check box next to the text , it 's not any fun at all . ; Yeah . ; Well I don't know .
Bmr025_851	s	so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it ; and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . ; Um ; and if so , it 's probably worth having one .
Bro014_518	bk	So they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline , ; Mm - hmm . ; but w which would be a much better baseline . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_134	cc	not just within the phonemes , themselves , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , ; and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard .
Bns001_228	s	and I would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t concerning these building blocks and the network , Um , What kind of problem we are going to solve . ; What kind of , uh , um , um , glue between these four building blocks exists ; and what kind of synergy effects , in principle , as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff . ; And what kind of service could we provide in that area .
Bro007_29	x	yeah another one . ; Yeah , that 's good . ; So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths . ; So
Bsr001_2137	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using .
Btr001_1739	b	It Well , it 's communicative . ; Uh ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_556	s	It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction . ; I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap . ; Yeah . ; Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting .
Bro028_921	s	so he can . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; So potentially if he came up with something that was useful , like a diff a better noise estimation module or something , he could ship it to you guys u up there
Bmr023_679	b	speaking rate . Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro008_168	bk	So , uh , in practice ; So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something . ; Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on . ; Oh .
Bro021_1097	s	pfff ! ; I can put log of EX plus log ; Oh . ; Yes . I understand now .
Bmr015_331	b	Yeah . ; My favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , uh , " you know , this should be far more detailed " , ; and the nex the next reviewer says , " you know , there 's way too much detail " . ; Yep .
Btr002_2884	aa	Oh yeah , that 's totally not true . ; Hmm ! ; No , not at all . ; Exactly . Exactly .
Bns002_1052	%	OK . ; So , for for uh , for sending one to any . ; Yeah . ; Hmm ?
Bed002_213	s	Ah . ; OK . ; It 's really simple though . ; So this is the idea .
Bsr001_845	b	Oh , really ? ; They 're doing an unknown number ? ; which is taking place right now , actually . ; Mmm .
Bro028_957	s	And , um , the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral auditory system . ; And I guess that is like a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . ; And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , um , PLP . ; I should learn more about that .
Bmr019_1858	s	Yeah . ; I 'm serious . ; You ; She 's she 's serious .
Bed003_532	g	Yeah . ; Um . ; well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object ; right ?
Bmr014_49	s	Yeah . ; Well , I think it 's ; Touching . ; uh , it it could be a number of things .
Bro022_293	2	So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . ; Mm - hmm . ; But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio ; It w i i it wouldn't affect things .
Bro014_1109	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So it 's sort of like division , when you do the yeah , the spectra . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_226	b	Patch . ; I I wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along ; Ugh ! ; Yeah .
Bns002_397	bk	Yeah . ; Fo - fo for forget forget about routing . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr003_950	b	Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones . ; Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature . ; Yep . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro023_1679	%--	It 'll keep going till I guess when they run out of disk space , ; It went a little long ? ; I mean , disk ; but
Bmr012_1095	s	Yeah . ; cuz I think that 's how we did it before . ; Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah . ; It 's a long time to get from LA .
Bro007_526	b	but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish ; Yeah . ; but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed ; Yeah .
Bro003_396	b	Mmm ? ; And so , ideally , what you 'd wanna do is you 'd wanna run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bro021_819	b	Right ? ; Yeah . ; S so , e um , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1475	s	I don't think that ; Hmm . ; We have never seen big differences . ; Once I thought " oh , I can Now I have these much better models .
Bro005_276	s	Right ? ; Oh , this the eighty - two . ; Yeah . ; Eighty - two is the it 's the Aurora baseline ,
Bro027_297	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz they have it
Bro005_1103	%--	Um Do we need to retrain ; I mean we can just take the re their training files also . ; But . But , uh ; just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another
Bmr010_799	no	Well , I don't know what you wanna do . Yeah . ; About what ? ; About the transcribers or anything or ? ; I don't know .
Bro026_861	%	Um . ; And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . ; Right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1499	b	I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things ; and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_987	s	Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line . ; Mmm . ; and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID . ; So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID .
Bro025_141	aa	Well , if we want to , like , optimize different parameters of ; Right . ; Parameters . Yeah . ; Sure .
Bro019_923	%--	and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . ; Yeah , right . ; I was only half kidding . ; I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid
Bro027_542	s	so it 's two - twenty . ; If you are phrasing f using three frames , it is thirty here for delta . ; Yeah , I think it 's it 's five frames , ; So five frames , that 's twenty .
Buw001_1403	s	because I think it includes also " important " ; in some cases . ; But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information . ; I think " important " can often be uninteresting .
Bmr026_153	s	Oh ; So I think , we 'll have something . ; It may not be as As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something . ; I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point .
Bmr023_1190	b	No , but we we when when we when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there . ; Oh . That makes a lot of sense . ; Huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_114	s	I think we I don't remember where the digits fell . ; I 'd have to look at that . ; But the final three there are no overlaps at all . ; And couple times there are not .
Bsr001_2231	s	Yeah . ; I mean , s it tho those those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of of trying , ; But if there ; Robert 's rules .
Bmr030_547	bd	Yeah . ; so . ; If you used a line out , too , you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something . It 'll beep onto onto the tape too . ; Maybe .
Bmr008_39	bk	No . ; OK . ; So Why don't we do it in that order ? ; OK .
Bed009_1128	s	First steps . ; Right . ; The the construction grammar . ; And she 's gonna start
Bmr012_318	bk	There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . ; Yeah . ; Oh , interesting . ; Oh OK
Bro026_271	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So the things that we , um , uh , ; I guess we sort of uh ,
Bed017_636	aa	The uh ; The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? ; because he did some work on topic spotting ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1344	s	So . ; No . ; No . ; It 's just informal .
Bmr016_324	s	whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech , ; and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data ; because you might be wearing a different microphone ; and , I mean so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times .
Bro021_182	b	Well , this for each mel band . ; Then put a threshold that 's fifteen DB below ; well , uh , a couple of DB below this maximum , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1136	bk	but very , very slow in comparison . ; Yeah , yeah . Right . ; Are you using the ? ; Oh , you oh , you are .
Bsr001_310	s	If they 're eighty bucks , that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I really like this . ; Uh I I mean , if I have to design the thing , uh I I would rather , you know , use this type of thing than the other ones .
Bmr022_150	s	Individual channels . ; Individual channels . ; Or they 're indivi ; If it 's individual , um y c we can probably run a forced alignment ,
Bed016_150	s	OK . ; Um , actually this is the the newest version after your comments , ; and ; Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that .
Bmr009_973	b	So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety . ; Yeah . ; You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great if you 're a linguist " . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1638	%--	i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban uh , formant centers are ; Yeah . ; I mean , that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , ; as as what you
Btr002_2467	bk	But I tend to not like " lipsmack " ; because I think that that 's could be meaningful ; and it 's a little confusing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1260	s	It 's not trained on Finnish , ; yeah . ; What 's it trained on ? ; I mean , the MLP 's not trained on Finnish .
Btr001_2515	b	He 'll be like ; Why ? ; " Oh , but I don't mean the transcribers we have here of course . " ; Oh .
Bmr029_436	b	Got it . ; Right . ; So when you said you were gonna start that top one , were you gonna use the new segmentations ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_618	bk	She 's on the email list , ; right ? ; Is she ? ; OK .
Bed012_891	aap	maybe it 's OK , so that that that we can that we have one node per construction . ; Cuz even in people , like , they don't know what you 're talking about if you 're using some sort of strange construction . ; Yeah , they would still c sort of get the closest , best fit . ; Well , yeah , but I mean , the uh , I mean , that 's what the construction parser would do .
Bmr024_404	s	You mean there 're more than ten ? ; Yeah , I ; Anything else ? ; Your mike is a little low there .
Bro024_702	s	if it 's music . ; Uh ; So , ; that that 's the that 's about the results .
Bro023_198	%--	Huh . ; th um , yeah , ; I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system . ; Like , may maybe if I trained on six seconds it would work better when I only had two seconds or four seconds , and
Bro016_264	s	Hmm . ; And if you have a nice front - end that 's in roughly the right range ; I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level , ; and we would rarely adjust them again ,
Bed015_200	d	Yeah . ; And the then let ; Yeah , that 's true . ; So that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here ?
Bro027_815	%--	And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's great . ; Uh , yeah , the next thing is , I started to play
Bmr006_1635	d	Is that how you pronounce her name ? ; Uh Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . ; Oh , uh Yu - Ching ? ; Yu - Ching ?
Bns001_1358	b	But for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question , " if we would have the money what would we do with that ? " ; Uh . ; So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money , we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1467	s	Well , we can find out . ; I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in in LDC ; getting data , ; Right , that 's the found data idea .
Btr002_2067	b	cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before , ; Is it OK if we stay for another half hour in this room ? ; but , um , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1103	s	that 's what I have , you know , started doing . ; The castle the that old castle one is sort of ; Metonymy , polysemy . ; I love Van Gogh .
Bed011_118	s	I 've I understand everything . ; And she does know everything . ; Yes I do . ; And she has a way of making this machine talk .
Bro027_1707	%--	the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . ; Th ; So , by having an additional , uh , feature which says " this is speech and this is nonspeech " , I mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . ; What
Bro004_250	b	Aha ! ; That 's interesting . That 's interesting . ; Do you see ? Because Uh , ; Uh .
Bro024_377	b	And I I g I guess I s just started thinking of another question , ; which is , for for the very first frame , w what what do I do ; if I 'm if I take if I use that frame to calculate the mean , then I 'm just gonna get n nothing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_801	%--	but by some speaker there 's a lot of words . ; Yeah . ; Ju ; No , not
Bmr028_992	b	So we would have to at least do that . ; No , actually ; No . You can run both . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_254	s	it 's very clear , flexible , and all those nice things . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . So , um , ; um , I spoke I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on on and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation .
Bmr031_763	b	Put the computer on tour ? ; and press the ; Yeah . A laptop . ; Yeah .
Bro028_689	b	And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations . ; So it 's it 's , um , another way to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_295	s	So are we gonna masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system , ; " I have one question I get one response " , ; or should we allow for a certain level of complexity . ; And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references .
Bmr026_280	x	Yeah , jus Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It just seems to me jus ; It would be cool to see it
Bro022_1060	s	So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , ; which is , uh , just the spectral I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . ; Um . ; And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , uh , Carlos filters , which Hynek had ,
Bro018_974	s	Another thing I was thinking about was um is there a ; I was wondering if there 's maybe um certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum . ; So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code ; but produce mel cepstrum
Bro003_1266	b	I kind of like this because what it ; No ; uh , no , what I like about it is ; OK .
Bmr008_238	b	Yeah . ; So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or what if there 's one more category that 's sort of general like that . ; so ; Yeah . Sure .
Buw001_1910	s	And , uh , um , ; you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers ; or ; I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages .
Bro003_1359	s	the database of Spanish digits . ; And I working that . ; Yeah . ; But prepa to prepare the the database are difficult .
Bro028_1202	%--	and get ou get our treats ? ; Oh , tea time ? ; Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them . ; That 's ri
Bro017_610	bk	No , ; in the proposal . ; in ; uh - huh , uh - huh .
Bmr013_937	b	like if there 's one speaker in there , that says " OK " or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , ; Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place ; so it 's not ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1432	s	i ; We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , ; Mm - hmm . ; that the that the , um , PLP , and and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model ,
Bro027_544	bk	Yeah , I think it 's it 's five frames , ; So five frames , that 's twenty . ; but . ; OK ,
Bro012_1287	%--	then that would that would I guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information . ; So maybe that 's what you meant . ; And then that would be ; Yeah , well , I was not thinking this
Btr001_916	aa	Because I think w ; m may di in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ? ; And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like ? ; Right .
Bro018_519	b	I mean uh my my guess would be that this is since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal , ; Mm - hmm . ; if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more more of one . ; Right .
Bed009_436	s	But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on ; Yep . ; Uh , y y your I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module ; you know th the functional module that that interacts with with where the tourism g stuff is going probably is too restrictive .
Bmr024_320	s	Uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , ; um , but only a small number of that ha ; well , not a small number ; only a subset of that has been transcribed .
Bro023_539	bk	What are they doing to do , ; do we know yet ? ; about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ? ; Yeah ,
Bed009_288	b	Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips were originally trying to do doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently ; so what they 're really doing right now is only selecting among the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given enriched by the domain knowledge and the um discourse modeler and so on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_401	s	So , discourse I I I thought about that . ; Of course that needs to sort of go in there . ; Oh . I 'm sorry . ; OK . So . This is minutes taking minutes as we go ,
Bro027_376	b	Yeah , ; yeah . ; SUSI or whatever it was ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro028_71	b	Well , it was mainly a discussion between Hari and David , ; Hmm . ; who was like ; Yeah .
Bro024_1533	s	Mm - hmm . ; So ; Oh , it 's clear . ; I should have gi given other results .
Bsr001_1106	b	We have a little bit of DARPA . ; Oh , you already got some . ; Uh , under the communicator project . ; OK .
Bmr011_1276	bk	Or ? ; And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , ; Just a source of data ? ; I see .
Bmr009_483	s	if it 's if i if it 's ; Tone ; Well , it won't be as big . ; I mean , even if you take the log , you can your model just has a more sensitive measures .
Bmr027_1105	s	Now this is a lot of terminology . ; Mmm . ; And they 're generally extremely good , ; but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check
Bmr007_722	s	So you 'd number them somehow . ; Yeah . ; Is possible to get information from the rhythmic f from the ge , eh uh , files . ; I finally remembered to put , uh put native language on the newer forms .
Bro016_65	s	Right . ; but , um , ; let 's just ; If we had to if we had to draw a conclusion on the information we have so far , we 'd say something like that .
Bed016_387	bk	um , how the construction and simulation ; that ho that whole th ; Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , ; OK , right .
Bro024_301	s	So you don't wanna @ @ chain it together from a from a different phone call . ; OK , ; so so so they would ; So it 's within speaker ,
Bsr001_1086	s	I , uh uh It shouldn't be done . ; You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to you might contract out to do the transcription ? ; Yes . ; We 're talking about that right now .
Bed008_291	s	um ; and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um ; We did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this ; in fact , the other two aren't up there .
Buw001_536	s	OK . ; And then they would say " well , we talked about this ; Hmm . ; and then we talked about that ,
Bmr031_610	s	Well , if not if you want to burn the C Ds , you 're welcome to it . ; I say we give it to LDC and let them do it . ; Well , yeah . ; Yeah , absolutely . If they have a way of doing it .
Bro012_548	d	um ; I mean , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say . ; So um I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with . ; So I guess the question is if you can do better than this .
Bmr025_333	2	Mm - hmm . ; So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um ? ; Mm - hmm , ; ranked .
Bro022_1025	s	SpeechDat - Car Italian . ; So , in some cases s there are also ; Yeah . ; There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .
Bed008_707	aa	Yeah . ; into mo ; so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? ; Right .
Bmr005_1289	b	so . ; I mean , it ; and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions . ; Right .
Bmr019_628	s	He 's he 's sort of back , ; but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today . ; Oh , OK . ; So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on .
Bmr011_302	s	Sorry . ; Yeah . ; Well that 's OK , I mean we 'll ; Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great .
Bmr023_530	qy	I it you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous ; because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . ; Right ? ; And you don't you there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? "
Bmr001_185	s	I have to use these batteries to bias them . ; And I 'm only get two channels and there 're a bunch of There are like three connectors in the circuit . ; The thing is , like , it 's it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop . ; So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one .
Btr002_649	s	So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally , ; I mean ; Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like in the case of something with clipping , ; But not helpful for speech .
Bns003_558	bk	OK . ; So , and then the next point and , I believe , yeah , So , not the last one , @ @ is one that I would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody concerning his future intention here at ICSI or whether e when he will leave whether he can contri or will he consider currently , uh , contribute here to the proposal ; because you know , I 've I 'm facing the problem , if I go back to Siemens ; and I say " OK ,
Bmr011_1842	2	Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like ; I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or even words inserted that weren't weren't there .
Bmr006_747	ba	because with the program , I cross the information of uh , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . ; And is eh , mor more similar . ; Excellent . ; Glad to hear it .
Bmr014_681	s	That 's ; I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say " here is a here is " ; I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? ; and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " .
Bmr024_256	s	They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and I don't think it 's possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible . ; It 'll keep your accuracy up .
Bed017_664	bk	Yeah . I 'm sure . ; I have um I think it was November two thousand three or some ; No . Wh - I had something in my calendar . ; Oh , OK . Right .
Bmr022_1240	s	And if we don't let them modify their own data , they 're not gonna store their data in our repository . ; Or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data . ; So then if they do have acc ; I I 'm just looking at it the other way around .
Bro005_47	b	Um . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization ; but with delta also , ; because the column was not completely ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1038	%--	But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . ; Because i that 's A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . ; And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . ; So that if if we have all these cases
Bed016_915	s	Mm - hmm . ; um , pfff ; you know , you wonder how people here make their living , ; and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery
Bmr013_918	ba	so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , ; uh , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that doesn't the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either .
Bmr020_1798	co	Yes , ; that 's my opinion as well . ; Yeah . ; So we don't do anything for it with it .
Bro013_274	s	Uh . Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . ; I mean so take a look at the uh um , the SRI results . ; I mean , they 're much much better , ; but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for uh things that are same data as in T TI - digits the same same text .
Bro013_354	s	and then smaller and ; So wha where did this good VAD come from ? ; So . ; It 's um from OGI .
Bro012_1222	b	And he had some I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA . ; It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_1132	cc	See how how how good they are , um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition . ; And , ; um ; and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses .
Bro015_197	%--	but it 's the company who prepared the Italian database , ; so it was ; Is it Alcatel , ; or ?
Bed015_2068	s	Yeah . ; but ; for the time being it 's it 's it 's fine to do it ; You just have to have a long list of , you know , all the variables .
Bmr025_841	s	we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . ; I mean , ; Right . ; uh part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes
Bro005_953	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; For moment you use we use phonetic targets ; but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets ,
Bro005_371	b	And the multi - English is how much ? ; You have here the information . ; It 's one million and a half . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1775	ba	but it was continued later . ; And I picked up with an ellipsis . ; Right . ; Excellent .
Bro021_748	s	And I 'm in the process of , like , building up that stuff . ; And , um , ; uh Yeah . ; I guess Yep . I guess that 's it .
Bro024_1194	aa	And and this this curves are the average over the whole database , ; Uh ; so . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1229	bk	and ; Yeah , right , exactly . ; I did my tour of the heartland . ; Right . Yeah .
Bro027_2040	s	but we 'll have to do without Sunil here somehow . ; When do you go back ? ; So . ; Thirty - first , August .
Bro023_1121	s	I mean , I 'm I 'm @ @ . ; and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , um , coefficients of the impulse response . ; But . ; So , basically it 's similar .
Bdb001_623	%--	Yeah . ; So , ; I mean , I assume this is possible , that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe , you can say , you know , from for from the c beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence , from the annotations , this is a unit , ; even though it never actually
Bro022_999	%--	uh ; Uh . ; I don't know , ; it 's
Bmr027_517	s	Mm - hmm . ; And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , ; but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd at al at all . ; That 's how these mailing houses work .
Btr001_631	no	you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ? ; I don't know , ; I 'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose . ; I don't know .
Bed015_1876	%--	No , no . ; Anyway , so so , um , I guess ; uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , ; which is that , um ,
Bmr031_1087	ba	Yep . ; But , um , in for instance , what we 're doing now w with , uh , Communicator data , but which we would like to do with Meeting data , is to actually label utterances , or words , or whatever units you want with , uh , you know , basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling . ; Mm - hmm . ; And for those type of tasks , it wou it 's much more efficient to present , uh , the th p present a bunch of , uh , clickable buttons or whatever
Bed010_60	b	yeah . ; So , the syntax trees are very simple . ; It 's like most of the sentences in one tree , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_38	s	Really nice guy . ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; Yeah , we met him in Amsterdam .
Bmr003_561	b	I did include a glo uh , a certain first pass . ; My my view on it was when you have a repair then , uh it seems ; I mean , we saw , there was this presentation in the one of the speech group meetings about how ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1119	%	I I think so , yeah . ; OK . ; And so , you other guys can decide how interested ; Yeah , @ @ .
Bro012_1081	s	He Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of from OGI ; and with the Alcatel VAD . ; And the experiment was sometime better , sometime worse . ; Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features .
Bmr027_220	b	even though we say that . ; But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that . ; So if we agreed , OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have ; Mm - hmm . Good .
Bed003_550	s	and uh ; Yeah , ; right . ; That would be a cue .
Bro005_982	b	Yeah . ; I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , ; and So this is one approach ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_719	s	um , I think that in in the um , in the short time solution ; um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , much as I said with JRASTA ,
Bed002_211	bk	Cuz I sent it to everybody . ; You just blew it off . ; Ah . ; OK .
Bro019_502	s	I have to to to test whether it works first or not ; Yeah . ; and then I 'll p port it to C ; and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result .
Bed004_676	s	OK . ; And so that you might want to then have those ; b Th - Then they may have to be separate . ; They may not be able to be values of the same variable .
Bsr001_689	b	And at that time I said , you know , we said , " don't worry about the the compute power " . ; I mean , it will be somewhere , you know . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_816	s	Right . ; Oh ! I wanted to ; This this approach here This is Uli Heid from Stuttgart ; is um a query language for research in phonetics where he wants to build in ToBI tags
Bmr014_463	s	So how are you doing the ; I 'd handle the numbers individually . ; How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ? ; It would be separate
Bro004_698	s	OK . ; We It it 's slightly uh different ; because I don't exactly initialize the same way she does . ; Actually I start , mmm , I don't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion .
Buw001_958	aa	That if if people have something in front of them ; I 'd be sort of cool . ; I mean , it would ; Yeah .
Bns003_964	s	Oh , not really , you know , ; uh , I I I I think that Well , in the future , somebody will come to the NSA group ; eh ; Then we can extend the proposal one more time with Multicast .
Bmr003_1922	qw	Right , ; that 's the problem . ; Why ? ; What what 's what 's the issue ?
Bed006_140	s	Majors ? ; OK , mayor ; " Mayors " . ; Something I don't know about these
Bro012_129	b	OK . ; That 's what I meant by a slice . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_241	s	OK . ; OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the NSF . ; I sent this ; actually this is maybe a little side thing .
Bsr001_1682	bk	We 're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this , um , endpointing stuff . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , ; of course .
Bed014_1075	%--	That 's f fine with me . ; OK . ; So . ; I might I might um ,
Bmr016_2035	s	OK . ; e by using scripts . ; Master copies of superset . ; When things change then the the script will cham change
Bmr006_1062	b	Yeah . ; Right ? ; So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in in in in ; Yeah .
Bed005_703	s	And , um ; I mean if if you want to uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great . ; OK . ; OK , so this is his specialty is reference ,
Bro022_1191	aa	You you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . ; Right ? ; I mean , you can just sort of normalize the ; No .
Bro021_1198	t1	And we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of E minus a function that conditional to E to the T to the noise signal . ; Well , this is this function is the the term after develop this , the term that we we take . ; Give PX and , uh , P the noise . ; X K C noise .
Bmr022_157	%--	But on the individual channels that would probably work , if they have enough words in the transcript . ; Yeah , we In fact , that 's Yeah , maybe we ; So , I mean , that 's pretty quick to run . ; It it 's , um
Btr001_1967	s	Mmm . ; because it 's hard to sit there and li see like , " But , don't you see h you 're being rude to this person , you 're cutting off this person ; I know . ; and it 's not nice ? "
Bmr006_742	ba	but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . ; I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , ; Whew ! ; Great . Great .
Bmr019_1493	s	Yeah . ; And the Aurora folks here will will definitely get something in on Aurora , ; which is not ; Actually this this , um So , there 's another paper .
Bro028_1154	s	and it it , uh it just doesn't do nearly as well . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , anyway the point is that you want to suppress ; it 's not just having the maximum information ,
Bro017_366	b	Hmm . ; Unless this noise is modulated . ; If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1629	b	Mm - hmm . ; because the non - native speaker ; there were five non - native speakers . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_362	t1	What are you looking for ? ; Um , where it actually produces the the XML out of the , uh , parsed stuff . ; Oh , OK . ; No , this is not it .
Bmr023_812	b	OK . ; um ; As I said before , the uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_159	b	And then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed006_292	%--	OK . ; Nuh . ; So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ? ; Yeah a
Bmr025_239	aa	Yeah , right . ; If he has then you learn , ; if he hasn't then he 'll do it . ; Right .
Bed004_336	b	Mm - hmm . ; and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related . ; And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones . ; Yep .
Bro017_79	s	I mean , you know , it might be that people will take uh uh th the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that . ; But I somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad , as long as people are happy abou uh uh uh honest about it . ; Yeah . ; And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again uh what will be available th is will be a code .
Bmr016_341	s	Not for adaptation , nope . ; v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on ; and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech ; and I thought " well , we 're gonna do better on that ,
Bed011_789	s	Hmm ? ; You could say " some " in there . ; I must say that thi this one looks a bit strange to me . ; Um maybe It seems like appropriate if I go to Las Vegas .
Bmr015_352	%--	Just just th ; Yeah . Yeah . ; I said something , yeah . ; Gary Strong 's
Bro016_336	s	OK . ; What 's old with you that has developed over the last week or two ? ; Mmm . ; Well , so we 've been mainly working on the report
Bro007_569	qo	but ; Anyway ; OK ; well I I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about
Bmr023_745	bk	Could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ? ; Ma - maybe . I mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard ; and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it . ; Hmm .
Bed014_776	s	Um . ; Yeah . So I think in fact , That 's the other thing . ; uh , this is this is , speaking of hard problems , this is a very good time um , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in ; and you know , where c where the construction per - se ends and where construal comes in ,
Bed002_545	b	you know ? ; somebody else has to do that job later . ; I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_182	b	You know , if we can plug in three , let 's plug in three . ; Mm - yeah . ; Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio , ; Right .
Bro027_158	bk	So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? ; Yeah , ; that 's on the far field . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_522	aa	I mean , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . ; Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask " um , are you recording video ? " ; Um , right ? ; Right ,
Bmr019_1164	%--	We ; and I just don't know . ; Yeah , go ahead . ; So what we 're doing
Btr002_3030	s	Excellent . ; and so ; I put in if it 's , um , unintelligible I put I count how many syllables and then I put in " six X " ; I do that if it 's unintelligible ,
Btr002_1494	bk	Yeah ! ; OK . And then there 's an arrow right here ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; OK .
Bed013_208	%--	And like thirty input nodes ; thirty input nodes . ; or some ; So to test every output node , uh , would at least
Bro021_1128	b	And then when we have a expression , uh , for the mean and variance of the noisy speech , we apply a technique of minimum mean - square estimation ; Mm - hmm . ; to obtain the expected value of the clean speech given the this statistic for the noisy speech ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_808	t1	but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . ; Um , I mean cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying ; Uh - huh . ; wha what are you doing this for ?
Bsr001_1281	%--	Um , ; and ; so that 's probably that 's probably what ; u
Bmr002_754	s	" KCM file formats " , ; Oh , looks like Looks like uh work packages . ; This is the ; Must be a European project .
Bed009_914	s	n Well I think I think there 's some misunderstanding here ; i ; Oh , OK . ; it 's Morphix is not used on - line .
Btr001_749	aa	Yeah , there 's nothing going on . ; At the beginning it seems to happen when , um , voicing occurs later ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_449	s	So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go " kur - chunk ! " ; Mm - hmm . ; And so it just was not doable with the current interface . ; You know , I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers
Bns003_140	s	Yeah , ; You have internet outside access , ; Full . ; but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know .
Bed006_1821	s	Here . ; This Friday . ; OK . ; The big parser show .
Bro022_172	s	And , um , ; wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? ; And so , ; uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .
Bro019_1656	ft	Yeah . ; Great ! ; Well , welcome . ; Thanks .
Buw001_913	b	Maybe maybe it 's no big deal . ; Maybe we just do it and see what happens . ; I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_511	b	But . ; Yeah . ; There 's a lot of head - nodding , in this ; Um .
Bed014_1010	b	So . ; Right . ; And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1408	%--	but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction ; which are , uh , sort of i can be looked at as m minor modifications of one another . ; Um . ; And they they 've now built up a nice piece of software that does
Bro013_237	s	Yeah . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment , ; Mm - hmm . ; just looking at the TI - di the uh tandem system , ; if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high .
Bed002_619	s	I mean th th i i if you can't do this task , ; um ; We need a different , uh , engine . ; Uh , uh , yeah , or something .
Bmr025_934	%--	No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , ; OK . ; it 's all digital . ; I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a
Bed014_1120	qw	OK . ; And , um . ; Sounds good . ; Someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the " where is X " construction ,
Bed017_233	s	to actually take the data , and do it . ; Uh , and we 'll see . ; Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , ; and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression .
Bdb001_1067	cc	It 's just they hadn't actually come up with an external format yet . ; So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . ; Mmm . ; But let me look at it again .
Buw001_80	b	This w ; Alright . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr001_678	s	It 's OK to g ; Right . ; Which I 'm interested in . ; I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings .
Bed002_1257	b	Oh , yeah . I don't know . ; n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , ; in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable . ; OK .
Bro026_924	s	But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .
Bed006_1007	%--	and " B " , that person actually wants to buy something to eat there . ; Nuh ? ; And if these are two different schemas , ; IE the Source - Path - Goal schema of getting there and then the buying snacks schema ,
Bsr001_2212	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Right .
Btr001_1347	s	Really ? ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; And I had to sorta break them down .
Bed015_1348	s	Mmm . ; So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying , ; e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? ; You know , like " Naomi wants wants su a certain situation
Bmr012_612	s	I mean there 's still just the w the percentages ; and , I mean they 're not a ; This i ; as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps
Btr002_1350	s	the SmartKom project , ; which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through Germany , ; Oh , right . ; and this is s supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way .
Bro003_680	bk	With what ? ; PLP . ; PLP ? ; OK .
Bsr001_985	s	Right ? ; At the same time . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; and you 're only able to hear um , parts of the weaker voice .
Bmr019_682	s	So , um ; And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too too severe . ; So that 's actually interesting . ; The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition .
Bro021_535	ba	You know , ; so something that is transitional in nature . ; Right . ; Cool .
Bmr016_588	s	It 's the same thing I mailed to every everybody that w where it was , ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So , we basically , um , did a lot of work on that
Bro012_681	%--	uh the uh um ; I mean , actually the the ; uh ; It made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear
Bed006_815	ar	yeah . ; whereas source is just an attribute ? ; Is that ; No , no , no .
Bed009_166	s	OK so ; facing to to what we 've sort of been doing here ; um ; well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .
Bmr026_1130	%--	Mm - hmm . ; What about uh hidden unit size on this . ; Oh , wait a minute , ; and the other thing uh ,
Bmr015_238	bk	yeah . ; but this is the next suggestion , ; so . ; OK .
Bro005_114	b	Yeah , ; then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from uh English digits , and from Italian digits . ; So this is the another line another set of lines in the table . ; Ah , yes .
Bns001_1461	%--	and figure out some real scenarios , ; and maybe then pfff ! ; Oh yeah . ; Because uh , despite the fa
Bro014_459	s	I mean , what was the the medium - mismatch condition again ? ; Um , it 's ; Yeah . ; Medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone ,
Bmr025_316	b	Right ? ; The Windows system isn't any harder ; because it it looks like a BSD system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_924	b	I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle . ; Yeah . ; Middle or end . ; Yeah .
Bro004_395	%--	But I I I I think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's ; um But we did
Buw001_426	b	You know , it 's like ; But you could always post - hoc label them . ; Right , right . Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_548	s	um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about ; and did you have some ? ; I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . ; So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal ,
Bmr007_285	s	Yeah , " yets " is not a word . ; Uh since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet um then that would have fallen through the cra cracks . ; It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far . ; We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know , second to second coding of when they occur .
Bro012_368	b	So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ? ; No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement ; not of the error rate . ; Yeah .
Bed009_114	qw	Yes . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So when do you guys leave ?
Bsr001_1591	bk	but it would be something ; So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it . ; Uh yes , ; OK , OK , OK .
Bmr018_1155	s	Those are all ; I don't remember the number off hand . ; It 's one of the NSA 's . ; I sent email before the conference , before last week .
Bmr019_1298	bk	Yeah . ; Maybe , you know , you could you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting . ; I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bed005_142	b	right ? ; Well , w w We d The first we did is we we tried to to do change the the " laufen " into " run " , or " running " , or " runs " . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_937	s	Mm - hmm . ; What sort of classifier ar ? ; Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . ; Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity .
Bmr022_734	s	and directory reorganization . ; So we still have to do that . ; But I don't think we need to do that in this meeting . ; But , uh It is something that needs to get done ,
Bro003_1311	bk	Um , the broader broader training corpus nets ; like TIMIT . ; Um , w we 're gonna ; Oh ,
Bed008_352	aa	But that 's - that seems to , ; yeah . ; So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . ; OK .
Bmr028_1761	s	You know what ? ; They can their four o ' clock cancelled , ; I don't think so . ; and they 're starting at four twenty ,
Btr001_934	bk	and then " PRN " , ; And then in the brackets , what it ; how it 's pronounced . ; Uh - huh .
Bro013_536	b	This is quite similar . ; this is this is another frame . ; ho how I obtained the envelope , this envelope , with the mel filter bank . ; Right .
Bed003_482	%--	No . ; Yeah , ; anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node . ; Uh . It
Bro018_767	s	I see . ; Yeah , ; and um cuz the uh ; So King and and Taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets ,
Bro027_440	aa	Um , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , um , nine frames of of six features from C - zero to C - fives , plus the first derivatives . ; And it has one hundred hidden units . ; Is that nine frames u s uh , centered around the current frame ? Or ; Yeah .
Bmr006_157	%--	You 're not talking about foreign language at all . ; Yeah . Yeah , just talking about . ; You 're just talking about ; Well , e I just think ,
Bro012_1084	no	Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; I don't remember .
Bro005_1138	%--	That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . ; But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . ; So it was sort of behaved reasonably . ; Is tha that a fair
Bro016_496	s	no , ; Italian and the Finnish and the English ? were development data ; Yeah . ; And Spanish , yeah .
Bed010_985	s	We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , ; I 'm not sure . ; It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . ; S so , we 'll see .
Bmr024_1610	b	Over a cappuccino tomorrow ? ; Yeah something like that . ; Um , uh , you know , maybe maybe we 'll involve Dan Ellis at some some level as well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_471	b	and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or ; e e and and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log , ; I mean , just listen to it . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_819	s	OK . ; Say that again ? ; Frame over fres threshold . ; So you take a each frame , and you compute the energy
Bro024_638	b	I I I guess you are using finally this the scheme which they ; Which is there in the spreadsheet . ; I 'm not changing anything in there . ; OK .
Bro019_1258	s	It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA , ; and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test , ; so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , ; and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things .
Bmr002_521	b	See what I mean ? ; I think there 's always this question of the trade - off between uh paying more for the first pass , and then h and then editing less later . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_425	t3	but ; So and what al also this means is that ; Right . ; Not Switchboard ,
Bro010_1284	bk	I do need your names and and the time , and all that , ; Oh , OK . ; cuz we put that into the " key " files . ; Oh , OK .
Bro028_489	b	So it 's ; you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off . ; On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something . ; Uh - huh .
Bsr001_1684	bk	Yeah , ; of course . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_1582	bk	An i an idea that would be nice i ; Yeah . ; OK , we 're crossing our fingers . ; Right .
Bed010_55	s	Basically , it just means " build the tree . " ; And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module . ; OK . ; But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the the syntax trees for three or four .
Bmr016_127	%	So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " . ; Right . Right , read them as single digits , ; so sixty - one w is read as six one , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_501	aa	And the and the German and Danish were the evaluation data . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1290	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , because one of Mari 's students was to wants to do some language modeling for , uh , predicting overlaps and , uh , stuff like that . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1129	s	Mm - hmm . ; to obtain the expected value of the clean speech given the this statistic for the noisy speech ; Mm - hmm . ; the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech .
Bed008_978	2	Right ? ; Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is is a mystery . ; I mean this is sort of ; This comes from traffic and so forth , yeah .
Bmr019_1697	bk	I don't I have no idea . ; I think this is something that would need to be checked . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro012_142	ba	I mean the actual numbers . ; Oh . I see . ; Oh . ; That would be lovely ,
Bed013_1010	s	OK . ; OK . ; or look for Mozart , look for thi " ; but the smarter way is to go via the ontology
Btr002_2244	b	That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too . ; Mm - hmm . ; In normal conversations , unless it 's very dramatic or very loud , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_56	s	He 's talking with George right now . ; Uh , is he gonna get a rip uh rip himself away from from that ? ; What ; He 'll probably come later .
Bed017_339	b	Right . ; Right . ; Well that 's the that would that would be a uh , you could sell it , as a ; Yeah .
Bns001_1657	s	And there 's UMTS , that is based on base station . ; There 's all that they consider . ; And then assume , OK , I can do that . ; And the networking guy said OK it would be great to have Multicast and all these kind of things in the network ,
Bmr020_410	aa	and we just scored it differently . ; So the recognizer didn't have the benefit of knowing where the foreground speech a start ; Were you including the the lapel in this ? ; Yes .
Btr002_3283	ba	Oh yeah . ; Initials . ; The initials ? ; I 'm glad to hear that .
Bmr013_179	s	It 's the beginning of time in speech recognition . ; Yes , exactly . ; Yeah . ; And we 've only recently got it to anywhere near human .
Bmr011_1814	b	because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will ; for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , ; because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_357	s	voicing detector . ; I mean , what what 's what 's going on now ? ; What are you doing ? ; Uh , to try to found , nnn , robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice .
Bed015_1551	%--	That 's ; Mm - hmm . ; Except s it 's it 's trickier than that ; because um , the reference for example
Bns002_713	b	e ; e ; Yeah , ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr006_1163	s	Yeah , yeah yeah , ; I I I will put eh the energy here . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess .
Btr001_1930	b	She always tends to get interrupted . ; Hmm . ; It 's OK if we say nice things about these people , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1307	s	that makes sense . ; Yeah . ; And if it if you do it If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like " So how much has it cost to enter ? " ; and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars ,
Bmr022_1013	s	which will be doing the real computation . ; Oh , I see . ; In other words , we 're we 're not gonna attempt to build , uh , it do the real work of building a portable device that 's little , that is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far - field mike , uh , compensation and all that stuff . ; So we 're gonna do all that on this powerful board ,
Bed013_1255	g	yeah . ; um , so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo more linguistic meetings we 've been talking about possible semantics of some construction . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bmr031_478	t3	It needs some back and forth ; I mean that 's wha ; because it 's it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . ; That 's like three times three times as much disk space .
Bed013_819	bk	You know , it was whether it was whether we would have a Bayes - net on the output and on the input , ; Oh . ; or whether the construction was gonna be in the Bayes - net , ; Oh , yeah . OK .
Bmr011_255	%--	So I think just do a field trip at some point . ; Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about ; Yep . ; and that
Bmr029_13	s	but using the far far ; the close - talking microphone . ; OK . So Um ; And you wanted I know you wanted the far - field data .
Bed008_600	s	Uh anyway , this is crude . ; Now but the now so so but then the question is ; uh ; so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology ,
Bed014_609	2	right ? ; so that ; um ; It would already be higher in the context .
Bmr028_1463	s	I think you 're saying " in my experiment , I cheated in this way " . ; That 's what I was saying . ; Yeah . ; I mean , another is what Liz was talking about , how in the Switchboard tests in all the Switchboard tests we 've been g doing , we 've been making the same er uh , same uh , uh , standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on .
Bmr006_80	s	So So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize ,
Bmr012_948	s	good news also ; uh I got ; well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings ; and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated
Bro014_1218	s	This is the the auto - correlation the R - zero energy . ; Do you have the mean ; do you have the mean for the auto - correlation ? ; Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say " I don't care about the source " .
Bmr029_976	s	and give the F - zero targets , ; And it saves it in a ; and then ts get gives out a a waveform , ; and I I want to manipulate the the waveform , then .
Bed006_868	%--	Tell us more about it . ; What do you what do you ; What 's that ? ; Oh I guess it
Bmr003_1013	aa	They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . ; What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ? ; Right . ; No .
Bed011_906	%--	Alright , so um So I think the order of things is that um , Robert will clean this up a little bit , although it looks pretty good . ; And ; What , ; well this is the part that
Bro005_784	bk	But ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; I see ,
Btr002_1109	b	but now I 'm I 'm just used to it . ; You 're multi - keyb ; I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati . ; Yeah .
Bed014_471	aa	um ; The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic . ; One of them was th ; Right .
Bmr028_332	s	Beep , ; y right . ; Yeah . Yeah . I like it . ; But let me tell you how I really feel .
Bmr003_1539	s	But really , no , uh w you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he 's saying ; but when you w when you listen to it ; he he ; It was a lot funnier if you were there though .
Btr002_2611	b	Because a lot of people , ; Yes . ; I think we already talked about this last time , ; Right .
Bsr001_1710	b	Right . ; Cool . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro025_292	fa	Rank . ; Oh . ; With the rank ordering ? ; I 'm sorry .
Bed015_477	bk	Mm - hmm . ; but my intuition would be that that 's right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr006_711	2	Now , eh , I need ehm , to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly . ; I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . ; Yeah . ; Duration .
Bmr029_145	%--	So ; But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive . ; No . It 's definitely It 's less than a hundred hours , for sure . ; It 's
Bmr001_334	%--	Well , I know . ; Well , that 's true . ; I mean . ; Except I s got a PDA way before
Bmr008_1115	s	You know , source , destination , relation . ; Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ? ; Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to uh , things that have that bear on the content or the status relations , would be the things ; Without being exhaustive , by any means ,
Bsr001_798	s	Yeah . ; Huh . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And he has a very good system for that
Bmr008_1193	aa	And you might want a tool that used that information . ; Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub ; I don't know what you would call them , but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have ; Sure , absolutely .
Bro019_1598	b	because it was just a question of quantization . ; Uh , we were just you know , storing ; It was We were doing , uh , stored speech , uh , quantization . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_410	bk	That 's it . ; Uh - huh . ; And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it , ; Oh , oh .
Btr001_132	aa	Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be ; No . ; Uh you 've heard , the " crown of pain " . ; Yeah .
Bed006_446	%--	they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room . ; Right . ; OK . ; Then I suggest we move on to the to
Btr002_50	%--	but I also wanted to , uh , share with you a couple of the things that I 've picked up in terms of checking . ; And these are uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts . ; I 'm just doing this cuz I think it 's interesting . ; OK . So , um , I have an example
Btr002_3143	b	Mmm . ; because I y English orthography conventions are just so , you know , uncertain anyway in the first place , ; and , um ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_328	s	That that could be . ; Um So , what about ; So these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh ; Uh , let me check .
Bed014_168	s	Oh , so this was You know , on the generation thing , ; um ; if sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well . ; So it 'll say it 's nonsense with perfect intonation .
Btr002_1124	s	I believe that 's correct , yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Linguine must be the one in the left - hand corner .
Bmr022_375	s	what the person was saying and the number ; In fact , we could put it at the beginning of each utterance . ; We could say " beep one " . ; And then they 'll hear the speech .
Bmr013_67	%--	So it will not take long . ; Um ; Uh , what what do you think ? ; My feeling is that
Bmr025_968	b	and ; you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr022_539	%--	And then , the second p ; I mean , you could do it that way , ; or you could ; It 's it 's
Bed006_901	qy	it it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container ; and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the Source - Path - Goal um you know goal uh goal I guess in this case . ; Mm - hmm . ; So uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity basically between things
Bed012_160	aa	But , maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate . ; So , does he wanna know where it is ? or does he wanna go there ? ; He wants to know where it is . ; Right .
Bmr014_1063	%--	And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias . ; Great . ; Great , great . ; And then then my concern about which
Bmr023_821	b	and So , that might even improve it further . ; Great . ; So , it looks like the P L - fea P features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1243	s	So we 're ; And you just ; It 's based on your se presegmentation , ; that 's the basic thing .
Bro005_463	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Eighty - s ; I thought it was eighty ; Oh , OK ,
Bro005_187	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . ; I ; Um , the uh , baseline system
Bed013_792	s	That would be my , uh ; We we should sketch out the details maybe tomorrow afternoon - ish , if everyone is around . ; I don't know . ; I think so .
Bns002_584	g	if they ; Because of this wall , if they are not neighbors , well , we can represent this putting this node like here . ; But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one . ; OK ?
Bmr014_656	s	Yeah . ; And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , ; a single password . ; Each person will have a single password , user name and password .
Bmr009_1646	b	Oh , this is the new one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , don't Don't read the old one . ; Alright .
Bns001_152	s	Yeah ? ; Maybe I can add something . ; Claudia ; Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site .
Bed014_322	b	but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets . ; Uh , which they call dynamic ; they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . ; Mmm .
Btr001_1118	d	This time is fine for me . ; about ; Yeah , this is a good time for me . ; Good time for you ?
Bed010_276	s	the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week . ; Yeah . ; It 's alright . ; Um . Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,
Bed009_900	b	We have knowledge bases from from Verbmobil system we can use ; Yep . ; and so . ; Right .
Bro012_457	s	and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it . ; OK . ; So . ; I should find that new one .
Bns002_386	ba	yeah , ; let me ; Maybe it 's better to to uh , draw it on the ; Oops .
Bro021_988	ar	Yeah , but the the second expression that you put is the first - order expansion of the nonlinear relation between ; Not exactly . ; No . ; No , no , no .
Bed014_558	%--	The one I sent you was from GMD , out of a European CRUMPET . ; It was terrible . ; Agreed . ; Um , and one of the reas one of the those ideas was ,
Bed005_638	s	And so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item ; um , as soon as we can do it . ; Yep . ; So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this ,
Bed010_990	%	and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape , ; OK . ; so uh and , ; Right
Bmr007_1026	b	but uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones . ; I was thinking about doing that originally to find out who 's the loudest , ; and that person is certainly talking . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_303	s	So , ; the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file , ; even though they 're always sequential . ; And so it does waste a lot of space .
Bmr019_92	s	Um , did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again ? ; I mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well . ; Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i ; it shouldn't have been as surprising as I as as I felt it was .
Bmr002_290	aa	Oh really ? ; Good . ; Cuz Morgan said he asked you . ; Oh , uh he did .
Btr001_250	aa	Huh . ; For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest . ; And the German speakers I found a little bit easier , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1162	bk	Three hundred dollars an hour . ; Oh , I 'm sorry , ; three hundred . ; Right ,
Bmr029_932	b	Synthesizers ? ; You were looking at Festival . ; Yeah , yeah . I was doing something for the SmartKom data collectioners . ; Yeah .
Bro018_1114	bc	which I 'm guessing is the reason why the baseline was so bad . ; And ; That 's ac actually a little side point is I think that 's the first results that we have uh uh uh of any sort on the far field uh on on the far field data uh for recorded in in meetings . ; Oh um actually um Adam ran the SRI recognizer .
Bmr027_633	%--	um , I I didn't anticipate this ; so I that 's why I didn't give this comment , ; and it I this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying " by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date ; and please " ,
Btr002_1752	s	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and it 's it 's difficult .
Bro025_637	bs	And and you can actually do it for final frame - dropping , ; but not for the VA - f noise estimation . ; Mm - hmm . ; You see , the idea is that the , um , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly .
Buw001_740	s	Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier ; Yeah . ; cuz you 'll ; Well , the wireless .
Bmr005_680	b	Yeah . ; Always need more for ; No , no . I I have to go to ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2083	aa	So ; Excuse me . ; you 'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on . ; Right .
Bro023_941	g	When you add the negative to the positive value ; which is the true estimate . ; Yeah . ; But nonetheless , uh , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ?
Bns001_1722	b	Yeah . ; ATM stuff . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_679	aa	s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? ; Mm - hmm . ; But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still ; Right .
Bro014_1481	fa	Yeah , yeah . ; Yes . ; I don't know . ; I 'm sorry ,
Bro026_368	s	Yeah . ; Well , so you could you c ; Or how are they using more than half , I guess maybe is what I ; Yeah , so I I think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects .
Bro021_509	bk	m ; or ? ; Um , well , I 'm gonna f work with TIMIT ; With TIMIT . OK .
Bed011_119	s	And she does know everything . ; Yes I do . ; And she has a way of making this machine talk . ; So she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast
Bmr026_100	cc	That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages ; and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll ; Oh , OK , OK . ; I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .
Btr002_1062	s	Right ? ; But the last couple times , like , you 've stolen Linguine before I can get to it . ; Ooh ! ; So I
Bmr019_1926	aa	we want it synchronized . ; Yeah . ; Hey , you 've done this before . Haven't you ? ; Yeah .
Bro025_433	b	Yeah . ; It ; Well . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . ; Yeah .
Bro010_1	bk	 ;  ; OK , we 're on . ; OK ,
Bmr030_731	s	I have to create the p appropriate sub - directory . ; So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where we put a y a U doctor speech data , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then I 'll either create a sub - directory for , like if it 's Meeting Recorder project , or Hub - five or whatever .
Bro014_1549	s	OK . ; OK . ; So that 's ; That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it .
Bro017_1255	aa	Wow ! ; Is it useful ? ; Yeah ? ; Ye - Yeah .
Bro023_1552	s	I see . ; Mmm . ; So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal , ; so if the the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track better track the noise ,
Bmr016_98	g	Maybe some , but I probably not so much . ; What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ? ; And ; Right ?
Bed015_1072	s	I almost listed " discourse status " as a slot where you could say it 's active . ; You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . ; Yeah . ; It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us ,
Bro024_605	%--	I mean , this is added noise . ; I mean , this is TI - digits . ; I 'm sorry . ; I meant in in the in the , uh , multi - language , uh , uh , Finnish and
Bmr008_1201	b	Exactly . ; It 's sort of a research question , you you 're analyzing the meeting and you 're deciding , " ah , there 's this kind of structure to it . " ; Y Yeah , it 's it 's it 's gonna change ; Yeah .
Bro019_1566	s	but . ; So , um , ; if @ @ Every root that 's ; Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients .
Bmr011_1243	s	Mmm . ; Now I 'm suggesting articulatory features . ; Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it ; but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things ,
Btr002_2640	s	Mmm . ; Um , so cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath , ; Yeah . ; and I 've been taking them out .
Bro012_75	b	uh ; Did somebody notice it during your talk ? ; uh No . ; Huh .
Buw001_2076	qy	but newly collected data would would be natural meetings . ; Actually , th @ @ the CMU folk have collected a lot of data . ; So . ; Is that is that going to be publicly available ,
Bro010_1046	bk	Yeah , ; so there 's a half dozen like that that are ; Uh . ; Yeah ,
Bmr013_295	aap	That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . ; And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , ; because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . ; Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about ,
Bmr006_327	b	Yeah . ; Tape recorder . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1237	bd	and and ; uh ; works OK . ; Obviously it 's not perfect
Bro004_1407	bk	Uh Training is longer . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro026_242	b	Yeah , th then the mel filter bank , ; Mm - hmm . ; then the log operation , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1382	bk	I 'm I 'm probably getting involved a little bit more in this active routing thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So uh I I maybe I will be able to hopefully I will be able to to give you a better answer in the future . ; Oh , OK .
Btr001_1286	b	I found them to be just ; I just I I ended up basically redoing them . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bed005_803	qh	You know Did we ever find m metaphorical use in in questions in in that sense , really ? ; Yeah . ; You will . ; And how soon ,
Buw001_599	s	Do they ? ; There 's uh a person with a laptop at each meeting . ; How many people are those meetings ? ; There are more .
Bmr014_265	s	Yeah . ; So let 's go with that . ; Uh , ; And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like .
Bro013_390	bk	but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD . ; We could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller ; or ; Yeah .
Bro014_1226	s	Right . ; Right ? ; Right . ; And so you just want to find out what the filters are .
Bro024_418	bk	So . ; OK . ; So that was all I had , for now . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_275	aa	And that didn't that seemed to be pretty ; Ouch . ; That doesn't work for you ? ; No .
Bed006_1287	s	So . ; No . ; I it 's easy to go back and forth ; The the reason One reason we 're doing it this way is in case there 's extra structure that 's in the Enter action that 's not captured by the schemas ,
Bed012_193	s	You won't it 'll be hard to decide . ; Yep . ; But I mean , I guess I guess the thing is , uh , this is another , smaller , case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty , ; which makes me think Bayes - net should be the way to solve these things .
Buw001_1252	t3	Hey . ; Ah ; Yeah . ; We 're still here .
Bmr016_1473	g	Onl ; yeah . ; No , only if you don't have lax vowels , I guess . ; Right .
Bmr028_713	b	Well , you know , uh , I All I need to do is mail , um send them m a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time . ; I did that with the last outage . I j I wrote to them letting them know that this w ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_1070	b	Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time . ; Yeah . ; So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription . ; Right .
Bmr026_949	b	By just taking the top whatever ? ; Yep . ; Yeah ; yeah .
Bed005_876	%--	I mean , that would just be a t a um ; Or , as a matter of fact , we need and if we if we ' r eh take a ten year perspective , we need to do that , ; because ; w
Bed006_48	no	and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper . ; Is that a good characterization ? ; u That 's pretty good , I think . ; I don't know .
Bmr003_464	s	The other thing too is from from a ; Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , ; so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . ; The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain .
Bro024_917	s	So they add a random random noise to it . ; To the just the energy , or to the mel uh , to the mel filter ? ; No . ; On - only to the log energy .
Bmr020_310	s	Right . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; You have a lot of a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting .
Bmr013_765	aa	Yeah . ; so you have the networks meeting ? ; Yep , we do . ; Yeah .
Bro014_90	x	So , um , ; I I think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training , ; As opposed to ? ; Good .
Bmr014_456	b	because , you know I mean , jus ; You don't know what they could be . ; Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear ; Yeah .
Bmr027_241	b	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm just saying you should decide something , ; I already did decide something , ; OK .
Bmr009_587	s	Yeah , it would be interesting . ; because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll turn out ; Yeah . ; and , You know , it 's always an interesting question .
Bro010_547	b	No , no , ; it 's based on this kind of method , ; this histogram method . ; Hmm .
Btr001_326	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , he was hard . ; Yeah . ; But that 's really interesting .
Bmr031_590	g	Two or three ? ; If you use both sides and the two layer and all that . ; It 's a lot more than that . ; Right ?
Bed005_642	%--	and the uh , description ; With sugge yeah , suggested improvements ; and ; Well b
Bed014_541	bk	OK , right . ; Right . ; Which one it is . ; Which of that is . Yeah , OK
Bro027_1568	s	So what I 'd been trying was , um , ; uh ; After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . ; So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech .
Bro010_966	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So he hasn't applied it to recognition ; or if he did he didn't talk about it . ; It 's it 's just
Bro027_259	ba	So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that . ; And it compiled fine . ; Eight . ; Oh , eh , great .
Bmr022_561	s	otherwise it 'll take forever . ; I mean , to really run recognition ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Well l I guess what I 'm thinking of is that w that a lot of times there will be they 'll put in question marks , that represent some unknown amount of speech ,
Bro021_163	b	but hurting in quiet case . ; And if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1337	bk	and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side ; Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1362	b	but I remember listening to ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . So actually we started with the words ; Yeah .
Bro007_206	s	Um Oh I see ; the one I was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one . ; Mm - hmm ? ; Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size reduced dimensionality .
Bdb001_839	s	uh , but then you store the data in the database , ; which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there . ; The , uh ; One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store ,
Btr002_2513	ba	Like , how do you transcribe " hmm ! " ? ; It 's like " humph " . ; I 'll put like a ; Really good point .
Bmr014_383	2	and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about . ; Um , for example , i they 'll say uh " ninety - two " . ; And you know , so how you could ; Nine two ,
Bed009_1109	b	you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved ; Yeah ; OK , ; Yeah ,
Bro028_861	%	And I don't remember whether it was filter bank things ; So th ; and I didn't ; Oh .
Bro028_990	2	Hmm . ; Whichever sub - vector , um , works the the best , I guess , he says the the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature , ; Y yeah . ; Gets thrown out .
Bro021_83	b	Yeah . ; And Yeah , it the C - one is ; There are strange strange thing happening with C - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be different . ; Hmm .
Btr002_2029	2	Who won't talk . ; except to say their digits or something , ; or who ; And to breathe .
Bmr018_629	b	I see . ; And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , uh , six out of the eight channels were all , like had a hundred percent error . ; Which probably means like there was a th the recording interface crashed , ; Right .
Bed017_624	cc	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh , in two weeks .
Bed008_1010	h	I think so . ; because isn't the , I mean ; S ; uh ,
Bmr022_315	b	And so , you know , a couple times they got it wrong . ; And there are some cases where there 's , um , very little speech before you hear a beep . ; So you hear a little bit of speech , beep , ; Yeah .
Bed017_118	s	And um . Was that enough of an update ? ; I think so . ; In what order shall we proceed ? ; OK .
Bdb001_1037	%--	Yeah ? ; I don't remember what the " P " is , though . ; No . ; But there are ni they 're
Bro005_679	s	and other good on - line normalization . ; Um . ; With respect to the features , ; with respect to the use of delta
Bro014_605	aap	or tryi ; Right ? ; I mean ; They 're sort of separate .
Bed012_704	%--	Vacation . ; It 's a pretty nice place , ; in my brief , uh , encounter with it . ; Do you guys
Bro014_1514	h	and then just re - synthesize audio ; and then send that . ; This is in order to use the SRI system or something . ; Um ,
Bed003_407	%	That 's how we have it currently set up , ; Yeah . ; but it could be , you know , based upon hour ; Yep .
Bed003_1825	s	So what 's " Economics , the fallacy " ? ; I just randomly label things . ; Ma ; So that has nothing to do with economics or anything .
Bns002_422	bh	Yeah , but eh a node is only is only involved in one transmission at a given time . ; So ; if now two has uh mmm answer with the with the CTS , it will be waiting until the data that has to come . ; Yeah ?
Bed012_850	no	What if I were What if I were to call you Eva ? ; I 'd probably still respond to it . ; I 've had people call me Eva , ; but I don't know .
Bro018_39	s	the with the new code . ; And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum , ; Uh - huh . ; the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero
Bmr020_776	%--	Um ; But yeah , ; I ; we can send I can CC Mari on this so that she knows
Btr002_1900	ba	Yeah . ; Right . ; Oh , yeah . ; You did an excellen excellent job .
Bmr010_1086	%--	So I don't wanna hire a ; Is you mean two thousand one ? ; Calendar year ; or ?
Bro024_1472	aa	it it 's ; i When when you have this , after you subtracted it , I mean , then you get something w w with this , uh , where you set the values to zero ; and then you simply add an additive constant again . ; Yeah .
Bns001_637	s	Uh . ; And my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here . ; But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind . ; I see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of UMTS know how .
Bmr008_635	qh	and uh , you know , not taking too much meeting time , ; and then in addition , add to it the third level of the balance , uh , um this this issue of not being too intrusive , asking in a way that they don't mind . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we release this corpus , what do we want ,
Bns002_70	s	Miguel , please . ; Thank you . ; Well , eh , I I have prepared , eh , a really short talk about some of the topics ; I I have been doing some w some research work uh before coming here .
Bro014_48	fa	and for the last three rounds e e they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three . ; And so , ; you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this . ; I 'm sorry ,
Bdb001_495	s	And that 's exactly what this stuff is based on . ; Since then , they 've developed their own external file format , ; which is , uh , you know , this sort of s this sort of thing . ; Um , and apparently they 've also developed a lot of tools ,
Bmr003_681	%--	How fast am I ? ; I haven't done a ; Yeah i ; s see , I 've been at the same time doing kind of a boot strapping in deciding on the transcription conventions that that are you know , and and stuff like , you know , how much
Bmr019_1132	2	Isn't " burst " is used also ? ; so ; Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other with hardware at ICSI . ; Here .
Bmr019_438	s	Oh , well . ; It 's great . ; So the To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this . ; No this way .
Bro007_356	%--	Yeah . ; and then we 'll operate with that ; and uh how long did it ; I guess if we 're not doing all these things if we 're only doing um
Bmr014_748	no	I guess an email OK is alright . ; Oh that was another thing ; I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient . ; But I don't actually know .
Bro023_166	b	because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component . ; Hmm .
Bns003_79	qw	Uh - huh , ; So you just have to ; And ; Why you are laughing ?
Btr001_2243	aa	Right , ; u Nnn . ; but ; That 's true .
Bmr007_543	s	Um no , when when when there 's backchannel , I mean , just I was just listening , and and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person ; Oh . ; and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel and then they start up again , ; and so I 'm wondering about h I just wonder how much overlap there is .
Bed015_491	s	So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? ; And then I think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y ; whatever ; You could build up an appropriately uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence .
Bro019_1306	bk	But anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ? ; Are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech , ; I mean . To maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds ? ; OK .
Bed015_685	%--	So , um , ; " in " was a good example . ; If you walk " in " , like well , in what ? ; You know , like you have to have the So so it 's only semantically is it
Bmr013_501	%	so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , ; Yeah . ; Actually maybe they 're using phone recognizers . ; Oh .
Bdb001_768	s	Are we gonna assign it to words ? ; Are we gonna just assign it to sort of ; when it 's rising we have a begin - end rise representation ? ; But suppose we dump out this file
Bns001_1058	s	Bu - well , you don't have a mobile phone in in the USA here . ; No . ; No . ; So that 's maybe the reason .
Bro011_470	s	Hmm . ; Right ? ; So it so um he 's got these um uh uh ; he " AND 's " between these different features .
Bmr029_202	bk	Right ? ; Because ; For the test . ; For the test set . Yeah .
Bmr020_1024	s	You know ? ; How how much how much extra would you allow at most ; I I wanted to ; I wanted it to be able to l he be heard normally ,
Bmr019_1637	s	So . ; OK . ; It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand . ; Yeah , three .
Bmr019_344	s	Yeah . But the thing is , uh I mean , w when you it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a a starter task for you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits . ; And I I think the answer is both . ; Well , I don't know . ; And for for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation
Bro018_683	b	it was Broadcast News , or something . ; I don't know . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bro019_1625	%--	Yeah , ; so the actual ; So you 're not getting the actual formants per se . ; You 're getting the Again , you 're getting sort of the ,
Bro024_1370	%--	Mmm . ; I mean , it ; Yeah . ; so the system
Bed008_195	h	Yeah , that 's a good question . ; And uh does it have a lazy mode ? ; I don't remember . ; Uh
Bed003_573	t1	Go ahead . ; and then try to find the probability of other nodes . ; OK . ; Dat - dat - dah .
Bmr007_1276	s	Yeah . ; Oh ; So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ? ; You 'll lose it .
Bmr009_1111	bk	And if you put ; We could ask where they 're from . ; It 'd be pretty simple , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_301	s	So I go home , and then I think ; I 'm not going back . ; Yeah . ; Either that or I think to myself , I can work at home .
Bns002_1379	s	uh some somehow a review of my previous work . ; I know , yeah . ; So eh this eh doesn't mean that ; I 'm I 'm probably getting involved a little bit more in this active routing thing .
Btr001_1497	qh	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's quite right . ; It 's like , " How could they do that ? "
Bns003_926	s	maybe it 's a small NSA group activity itself , with no linkage to the outer world ; maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home ; there 's some linkage ; and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area , uh , with the supported , um , home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area .
Bns001_1639	b	And this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet . ; That 's the basic idea , ; that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1076	b	Yeah . ; and then what 's the discourse history give us . ; Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_326	%--	yeah sounds like a bug . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; so anyway it 's it 's just
Bed011_302	s	off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want , you know , richer data , ; more complex stuff going on , ; people trying to do more complex sets of things . ; I mean you know , if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistic stuff .
Bns001_151	%	Can I ? ; Yeah ? ; Maybe I can add something . ; Claudia
Bmr023_441	%--	it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones . ; But , it will be possible in the future ; Yeah . ; because we we 're , um .
Bed013_59	s	And um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva ; because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough . ; OK . ; So this is so weird it should even make you happy .
Bro010_1153	s	OK , ; well , um , ; there was something that was done by , um , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , um , ; Avendano .
Bsr001_2562	s	It ; For ours it will ; but we have a rear projector , ; so it 's in a separate room .
Bed004_816	s	for uh telling someone else how to go there , ; Getting out of ; whatever it is . ; So that that , the the decision processes are gonna be different
Bmr007_133	aa	Raw counts . ; So it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yes , very true very true
Bro027_1979	s	Uh - huh . ; This afternoon uh ; Oh , right , ; for the Meeting meeting ?
Bmr025_975	s	Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually ,
Bro022_36	%--	M ; Do you want to start , Morgan ? ; Do you have anything , ; or ?
Bmr003_1938	qw	But ; You know , it 's like , it 's that simple . ; " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . " ; b but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking ?
Bmr029_191	bk	Well , I 'm as I said , I just started the recognizer , um ; It will uh , it will probably be a couple hours before before I have some results . ; Oh . Well , that 's not bad . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr012_856	bk	Yeah . ; so shouldn't use you should s you know , get ; Yeah , I mean I 'll I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same , ; OK .
Bro008_82	b	And there 's things that we 're doing that they 're not doing . ; And and they all seem like good things . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr012_657	s	so I brought back just these result files ; and people can look at them ; um so ; We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here .
Bed014_230	b	Um , I suggested to try something that was really kind of ; even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked , ; but it worked . ; Hmm !
Bro012_1245	s	given the constraints of this task , we can't , in a very nice way , feed forward to the recognizer the information ; the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced , ; Mm - hmm . ; where w we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything .
Bns001_141	%	And we wanna put it on the web pages in the next days . ; So , I will send an email , then , to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they 're aligned with , um , their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages . ; And any feedback is then , well appreciated . ; No ?
Bmr019_1222	s	So , ; you know , it 's it 's sort of ; Yeah . ; I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before ,
Bmr006_805	ar	Which catege which category ? ; Like a c ; Where ? Where What is the class ? ; No . By the moment , no .
Bmr006_617	s	And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . ; I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that . ; So . ; So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News ,
Bmr025_457	b	" It 's pretty soft and squishy . " ; Yeah . ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bro028_253	%--	Yeah . ; Um ; Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation ; and th um , maybe try to train uh , the training data for the t
Btr002_2061	bk	Never changes . ; I 'm gonna check out outside to make sure that we 're OK with the , um ; Oh , OK . ; Oh . OK .
Bro019_1222	s	Voiced , unvoiced is like ; Uh , no . ; Oh . ; Or anything .
Bmr015_648	%--	then that really does require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers . ; Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , ; but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . ; So it 's li you know , kind of wondering
Btr002_1135	s	And then the f the far right corner as you walk in ? ; Yeah , r Yeah , that 's that one 's got the the PC keyboard , ; and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard . ; Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you is Amaretto .
Bed003_1127	b	I don't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . ; That might be a bit complicated . ; I think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that , you know ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_580	b	and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . ; An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , " what the space configuration is at the time of utterance " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_122	s	It 's in some ways easier and some ways harder . nuh ? ; Yeah . ; But , um , ; I think it 'd be fun to look at it , or into that question .
Bed004_172	s	So we get nice um data for that . ; Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing , ; so where , even though w we don't tell the person " ask blah - blah - blah - blah - blah " ; they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible .
Bro021_417	s	Well . ; So . ; Yeah . ; So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients ,
Bmr009_1424	aa	Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well . ; Southern , Cockney ? ; Yeah , and ; Yeah .
Bmr020_995	bk	Yeah . ; Looks good . ; They were , um , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight . ; Oh .
Bro026_876	%	And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . ; Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . ; Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1607	s	It it it 's it 's sort of the first - order thing to do . ; There 's , uh , you know , uh , obviously much much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do . ; OK . So , that 's so that was our sort of ; But that 's th that 's the first thing to do .
Buw001_531	qw	Minutes . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? "
Bmr015_826	qh	other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . ; And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope . ; The higher frequencies will be lower energy . ; But so what .
Bmr021_148	b	which I 'll change to mike type , or something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1217	%--	But for me sort of the interesting thing was , " well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? " ; So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , ; and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or or whatever ; To know
Bmr010_1096	s	because the the funding that we 've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year . ; But having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , uh , funding . ; Wonderful . ; And then school will start in in the sixt on the sixteenth .
Bmr018_1575	s	But they hadn't even come close to that point . ; All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion . ; Yeah . ; But they 're all going the same way ,
Bmr019_786	qw	Um , and then use that as a reference ; and tune the parameters of the of the model , uh , to op to get the best performance . ; Yeah . ; G given I I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better .
Bmr008_1768	b	Right , if you 're sending at an integer instead of a long . ; The typecast . ; Typecast from integer , " int " INT or long or unsigned long . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_861	b	I I I understand . ; I think that 's the bad idea . ; I know where you 're going . ; Oh .
Btr002_2045	s	Exactly . ; Definitely . ; I was going nuts . ; I was like , " I cannot take this anymore .
Bmr007_580	2	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I could imagine that as there 's a fair number of um cases where , and this is sort of , not really hostile , but sort of competitive , where one person is finishing something and you have , like , two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to , uh grab the next turn . ; Trying to get the floor .
Bsr001_1276	s	one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is , ; um , ; I mean , y you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards . ; But the the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection , um , is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to a computer in the machine in in the room .
Buw001_1560	%--	I 'm supposed to do this . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; It it doesn't ; Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " ,
Bmr030_229	s	They 're pretty cool , ; No . ; Nope . ; like the prosody demo , we basically w loaded up um , word alignments .
Bro011_278	s	Great . ; Yeah actually um he should uh ; I wonder who else is ; I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation .
Bmr027_1487	b	Mmm . ; Oh . Right , right . ; because you have timed sp at on either side . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_465	s	we take a very ; Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant ; and we we made some recordings there . ; And then we we , uh uh , made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things ,
Bed005_950	s	OK . ; Um , y you guys sort of started fighting , uh , on the Bayes - net " Noisy - OR " front ? ; Hmm . ; Yeah , I thought I should , um , talk a little bit about that ,
Bmr013_357	b	because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . ; Right . ; So people purposely don't add them . ; Right .
Bro016_941	s	How are , uh , uh how are things going with what you 're doing ? ; Oh . ; Well , um , ; I took a lot of time just getting my taxes out of the way
Bmr011_444	s	I I just really don't know . ; OK . ; Is he involved in ; Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project .
Bmr013_101	s	Yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this Aurora , uh data set . ; And , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about , ; uh ; I think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit .
Bmr028_1221	b	I bet it wouldn't change a lot . ; Right . ; What are the nature of most of the changes ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1302	%--	Right . ; So if that 's at an ; Hmm . ; I guess it depends on Jane 's
Bns001_1621	s	So , one somebody or two somebodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project . ; But that the other four should build a service on top of it , that has a clear business focus . ; mm - hmm . ; It means eh a a UMTS service basically .
Bmr014_564	s	Yeah . ; because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person . ; Oh , OK . ; But um the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,
Btr001_1713	aa	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh yeah .
Bed014_1316	b	Yeah . ; But if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world um then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_757	s	yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , ; so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car ,
Bro014_523	x	Mm - hmm . ; which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like , well , more than sixty percent improvement on ; So nobody would be there , probably . Right ? ; on o e e uh
Bro017_265	b	And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions . ; Hmm . ; Exactly , that 's what yeah , that 's what it is . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_1318	s	Yeah . Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Across the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate .
Btr002_2989	s	Yes . ; Oh , OK . OK . ; And of course , potentially they 're codable , ; but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is ,
Btr001_609	s	The women were easy to f figure out who was who , ; and then the men all their voices sounded the same ; except I think there was one British English speaker ; and that was easy
Bmr021_47	s	and that will certainly work . ; The other option is to try yet another mike . ; Find one we like and potentially get six , all the same . ; I have a question about this .
Bmr015_909	qw	But the instantaneous frequency , ; wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ? ; I mean , I think if you ; Does i does it Why would it correspond to pitch ?
Bmr003_1723	s	And sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it ; but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point . ; So I have I have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . ; And then when it uh , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash ,
Bmr018_1414	no	Do a trip report . ; yeah . ; Well , the summarization stuff was interesting , ; I mean , I don't know anything about that field ,
Bmr012_207	s	but I was able to can transcribe ; I don't remember when it is . ; suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent ; but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that
Bro028_1055	s	I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . ; So , you you you you pick the best feature . ; And then you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it . ; And then so on and so on .
Bmr016_442	fa	The Aurora theater . ; OK . ; Go . ; I 'm sorry .
Bed015_1388	%--	And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff ; Mm - hmm . ; is that where you would sa ; I mean , that 's
Bmr023_867	%--	Yeah . Why did that cha ? ; but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's why I wanted to look
Bmr009_750	%--	and Um ; It 'd be worth a try . ; It would be interesting to see what we get . ; Just , you know , low - pass filter the speech and
Bmr026_1146	s	I missed ; What What 's the key issue here ? ; Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors . ; And if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system .
Bro021_18	s	Um , ; I guess there 's the usual updates , ; everybody going around and saying , uh , you know , what they 're working on , ; the things that happened the last week .
Bmr021_85	b	Well , I mean , that 's the other option , is that we could switch the form so it 's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike , ; You know , pretty ; um , and then get duplicates . ; Hmm .
Bro025_429	b	Yeah . But it 's it 's difficult . ; Sometime we we change two two things together ; and But it 's around maybe it 's less than one percent . ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_588	aa	So 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , ; and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , ; um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could . ; No , it doesn't say it at all . No .
Bed005_846	s	And th th the their discourse patterns probably don't follo follow quite as many logical connec ; Right . No , I think that 's one of things that 's interesting , ; Yeah . ; is is in this sort of over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario .
Bmr016_860	s	as long as you can regenerate it . ; Right . ; Yeah it 's ; I mean all of this stuff can be regenerated ,
Bro018_152	br	but I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here , ; so here 's here 's an idea . ; uh What about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ? ; Ah I 'm sorry .
Bro027_844	bk	And then , there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem MLP . ; Oh , oh . ; OK . ; Yeah ,
Bro019_430	s	I see . ; G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway , ; everybody does that , ; and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use .
Bmr014_1122	s	Well and furthermore I ; it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth ; that that uh if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh " OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , " ; uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now
Bmr030_428	b	and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps , ; Exactly . ; and go forward in the file , et cetera , et cetera . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_232	s	Uh - huh . ; Oh yeah . ; otherwise my ear channels , ; That would give you a headache .
Buw001_538	%--	Hmm . ; and then we talked about that , ; and so - and - so talked about " ; And then you 'd have , like
Bed006_1113	b	because uh I mean many actions presuppose some um almost infinitely many other actions . ; So if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry . ; Yeah . ; Mayb - yeah .
Bro014_1077	b	Two hundred and fifty thousand . ; Fifteen hundred . ; Because ; Yeah .
Bed016_584	aa	Et cetera . ; So that 's that 's where this , um , ; So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule . ; Right .
Bed014_877	s	Right . ; Uh ; Good luck . Really . ; So that , so th thi this I mean , so this is the point , is we we 're going to have to cycle through this ,
Buw001_122	%--	Right . I mean , we because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things . ; I mean , cuz I tend to take notes which are summaries . ; Right . ; And so , you know
Bmr006_70	s	And in that uh , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . ; So this this meeting is one of them , ; although I 'm not sure I can participate if I ; You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization .
Btr002_1811	s	Now you did it again ! ; Stop torturing them ! ; No ! ; Let 's not make things hard on ourselves later .
Bns001_1407	s	but uh , I 'm just saying that it will be able It will ; Sorry . ; It will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology . ; If somebody tell us , " OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . " How can I do it now ?
Bmr026_186	%--	Well , we 'll see , um ; Well Yeah . ; I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows ; so i
Btr002_3366	s	And so , in one in one in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred instances of this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So there 's no need to add the " vocal " or the " non - vocal " .
Bmr016_35	s	Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form . ; So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms ; and for meetings in which the " key " file and the transcript files are parsable . ; Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand ,
Bmr001_373	bs	They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work . ; OK . ; So , we 'll just have to see if that works . ; So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps .
Bmr022_319	qh	Mm - hmm . ; a little bit of speech , beep . ; Maybe three of those in a row , ; and was that three beeps ,
Bed016_837	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; I think there was " over " ; but there was also a paper on " out " .
Btr002_1726	s	Wow . ; And you were like , w " That 's fascinating . " ; I remember that meeting . ; I thought it was pretty funny .
Bmr027_160	bd	Uh , well . ; Yeah . Those uh ; NSA . ; OK . I spoke loosely .
Bmr003_2638	b	can you do one more round of digits ? ; Are we done talking ? ; Well it 's a choice if we get a choice , let 's keep talking . ; Sure .
Bro013_599	s	and what we clearly see is that in some cases , ; and it clearly appears here , ; and the the harmonics are resolved by the f ; Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering ,
Bro023_469	fa	And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like , ; um ; So , I still don't have the word error rate . ; I 'm sorry about it .
Bed005_834	b	So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain , actually , ; was that most of the things we talked about are our story understanding . ; Uh , we 're gonna have a short discourse ; Right .
Bmr031_337	s	What happens if th they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources ; I ; or ? ; Well , again the hope is that , uh I mean , it 's it 's looking I mean , I have to ask these folks
Bmr003_1685	bk	Yes . ; But their but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , then i they a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr014_1225	s	It is true that tec that the content is technical , ; I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which ; Yeah . ; I I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own .
Buw001_545	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , ; you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , ; uh , with mult
Bmr027_963	b	I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . ; There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that it 's just that aren't in there . ; So . ; Hmm .
Btr001_2682	ba	Mmm . ; Oh , my ! ; Yes . ; Oh , wow .
Bed016_702	s	as well as , mappings ? ; Right right r ; w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something ; and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions
Bmr022_1327	s	and they were keeping the repository and we were d collecting meetings and sending them to them . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; If I found an error , and I sent them email and said " here 's this error " , and I didn't get a response for a couple weeks , I would stop sending them the my data
Bmr024_57	s	At least , ; yeah , ; Yeah . ; he 'll t he 'll probably be interested .
Bmr020_1745	aa	So just put them on some other channel . ; But , ; when thi when this is sent to to the I M - eh , I B M transcribers , I don't know if if they can tell that 's really ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_649	aa	I mean , ; we didn't dare to say it will be just in a PDA you throw in the middle of a meeting . ; I 'm beginning to feel my heart beat now . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_742	aa	Yep , and then just sort of died out . ; probably chose the wrong scribe ; but it was It 's uh ; Yeah that 's right .
Bed014_750	s	You 've noticed that . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines ,
Bmr016_2084	s	Now I I could have adopted a similar convention for " percent " , ; but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? ; Hmm . ; i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are
Bsr001_229	b	I mean , on on the temple 's the pressure ? ; I 'd ; They really press my temples , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr021_860	ba	what what bandwidth do you use , and stuff like that . ; And uh we could play the same kind of games with the ICSI front - end . ; Right . ; Uh , actually , the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role .
Bro014_1491	ar	After the after , uh , the result for the TI - digits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people . ; Yeah , but ; Y ; Oh , no .
Buw001_282	s	Right ? ; Right . ; I mean , they 're something . ; It 's a a kind of output you 'd like .
Bmr021_159	%--	so ; OK , it 's just I 'm just thinking that if ; It has the same potential for error as everything else . ; it 'd be
Bmr029_848	b	So . ; It doesn't make I don't think it makes that much of a difference . ; It 's just this little detail that if you can take care of that , then you should . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2377	s	Yeah . ; It 's possible , ; now what I 'm thinking ; I didn't have the extra the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the " uh " , which you just which you just did .
Bmr003_1948	s	It 's it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool . ; You y ; I haven't found any tools that I like . ; It 's just as easy to use to edit the raw HTML as anything else .
Bed005_753	%	the Ple - Powder - Tower ? " ; Mmm . ; Uh , you need some mechanism for ; Yeah .
Bed002_1064	s	So it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . ; I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here ,
Buw001_813	s	I 'm not sure . ; we we might try that some ; and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , ; uh , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think .
Bro019_110	s	Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called " run command " . ; " Run dash command " , ; " run hyphen command " . ; And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine ,
Buw001_604	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Y you should also have a record of what 's on the board . ; They 're very sparse .
Bmr020_1692	s	And then we can you know ; Yeah . ; That 'll oughta be a good way to get the pipeline going . ; Oh , I 'd be delighted .
Bro028_435	s	Mm - hmm . ; rather than with with a s periodic source . ; Right ? ; So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise ,
Bed011_1002	ar	By the end of the summer , too . ; No . ; No . ; No .
Bed003_571	s	So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes ; Yeah . ; Go ahead . ; and then try to find the probability of other nodes .
Bed008_305	%--	the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes ; uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . ; So each of those ; the way we had it designed ,
Bmr031_594	b	DVD is eight gig ? ; Well , I think you 'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there . ; S seventeen . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr027_1283	qrr	Whew . ; Or we can move them . ; No . ; Or extra disk ?
Bmr024_867	s	It 's the back - up system . ; Yeah . ; So ; which is near saturation , apparently .
Bed006_1199	s	There a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that , ; um is ; OK , so you have an SPG action ; and and it has three different um uh aspects
Bro019_926	b	I mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro008_455	x	Um ; and , uh ; what I like about it , in a way , is that , uh , the results are still so terrible . ; Uh Uh I mean , they 're much better than they were , you know .
Bed016_795	g	Uh . ; Or , " having " is also , um , associated with location , ; Yeah . Yeah . ; right ?
Bmr008_538	ba	OK . ; and then if you 're American you would just circle the region where ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's the concept ,
Bro025_274	b	channel one which is far - field microphone . ; And ; if we just take only the , um , VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far - field , uh , test utterances , then results are much better . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1136	s	and we have the mel filter banks , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so if we if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , we have something that 's close to the excitation signal .
Bro019_482	bk	so that is when uh , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched . ; And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now . ; And uh , ; Yeah ,
Bmr026_1124	s	It just ; Yeah . ; But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance ; I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .
Bmr011_115	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right , so one th ; Well , so ; uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones
Btr002_1684	bh	It 's really funny to listen to . ; I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers . ; You haven't ? ; Really ?
Bmr021_566	fa	Oh . ; No . ; Hmm . ; Sorry .
Bmr011_309	no	And , uh , that 's that will enable us to do nice um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . ; At present it 's not possible with limitations of of the , uh , original design of the software . ; And um . ; So , I don't know .
Bmr031_726	s	but for other groups too . ; For u the whole institute . ; Yeah . ; So there 's this sort of coordination issue ,
Bmr028_1545	%--	Mm - hmm . ; But we can sort of cheat on that factor ; because it 's somebody else 's research . ; And then we just
Bed002_794	s	and it understands you completely . ; And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , ; dial a number , ; and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve .
Bro013_52	g	And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; It 's tha it 's that much , huh ?
Bro005_757	s	No ? ; With the better ; No ? ; With the O - OLN - two ?
Bro005_1322	s	And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . ; And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . ; Um , but um , uh , ; we only have limited time
Bro022_200	%--	where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy sections ? ; Um , ; uh , ; if you
Bmr025_705	%--	and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . ; On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . ; So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk . ; And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the
Bed003_553	b	That would be a cue . ; what 's the fastest way ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1016	s	No . ; Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . ; They want you to call and and talk . ; So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour .
Bro017_916	b	Do you see what I mean ? ; Let 's see . ; I think What I see What could be done is you don't change your features , which are computed once for all , ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_492	b	Wi ; Oh . ; " Nice walls " is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1186	2	Because I think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it . ; I think you have to have some kind of structure from the ; Hmm . ; Feedback .
Bro004_1013	%--	uh uh , it 's it 's really time to time to choose . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , let me pass this out , by the way . ; Um These are
Bro014_904	b	Mm - hmm . ; Well , yeah , except the variance was big . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bed009_308	b	and I I think that fits in perfectly ; So well , let me Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1209	s	Yep . ; and ; I like that idea . ; And I use it 's it 's , uh it 's an A below middle C beep ,
Bmr031_747	aa	Is is the areal density of the microdrive higher than of a w normal drive ? ; It must be . ; When they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we 'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data . ; Yep .
Btr001_2337	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that .
Bro024_867	b	And it and it and it has significant effect down there . ; That was , sort of the idea . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bns003_496	b	I think it 's a good idea , ; not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense . ; Eh , but I think the idea from Claudia is very good , that the slides from the talks here , if it 's worth to have it on the web , anyway um , should be published in that way that the people can access it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_703	s	Mmm . ; Which is , you know , uh uh utopian ; completely utopian at the moment , ; but slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh contingent .
Bsr001_2139	bk	Yeah , ; Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using . ; that 's right . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bro013_110	x	Um . But just train those H M Ms using different features , ; the features coming from our Aurora stuff . ; Yeah . ; So .
Bro014_1601	b	We can talk more about it later . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_931	aa	I I don't ; So ; if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think . ; Sure .
Bro012_600	ba	Man ! ; Yeah . ; You 're right . ; That 's amazing .
Bmr023_518	2	Bu ; Yeah . But th I mean , the editing will continue . Presumably if if s errors are found , they will be fixed , ; but they won't change the the content of the meetings . ; Content , really .
Bmr009_549	b	and did you have some ? ; I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . ; So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_660	b	And then we can offer up the room , ; and ; Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , ; Right .
Bro005_505	b	uh , d I have found more or less the same result . ; So , it 's slightly better , ; Little bit better ? ; yeah .
Bmr019_554	b	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something . ; Yep .
Bro027_254	s	And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed . ; And so I downloaded the , um ; There were two things , uh , that they had to download . ; One was the , uh , I guess the software .
Bro013_401	bk	Uh I designed a new a new filter ; because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds ; and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s ; Right .
Bmr023_1033	%--	That 's what we did . ; Right ? ; OK . ; So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that
Btr002_1650	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm going " OK . " ; " I 'm just gonna listen to you . "
Bed016_708	s	OK , f let 's let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " . ; I mean , that 's what you started with . ; Mm - hmm . ; So " in the bus " and " on the bus , "
Bns002_1501	b	also these are the official ones , ; Yeah , sure . ; You see that in the ICSI US on the U S A side , I believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_236	b	What happened ? ; otherwise my joints here . ; I mean , depending where I put it , it press different things , ; Mmm .
Bmr028_1636	bk	So , ; if there 's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all , it 'd be much better to go to another meeting , I think . ; I actually think that Thilo 's n in a in a k a You know , when you do the pre - segmenter and you and you run across troubles He he runs across s some of these that are ; Yeah .
Bmr008_129	s	I want it to be self - evaluating . ; You can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's non - threatening ,
Bro011_31	bk	I guess Chuck you weren't there either , ; so the uh ; I was there . ; Oh you were there ?
Btr002_3010	bk	I wanted to mention that one , ; Man ! ; I 'm glad you ment brought that up ; yeah .
Bro005_996	bk	And uh If Cuz what you 're trying to do is come up with a a core , reasonable feature set which is then gonna be used uh , by the the uh HMM system . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro007_141	s	OK . ; Except I don't know because they I think they are still working well . ; Uh - huh . ; Uh t two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector
Bmr014_1167	b	Liz will like it . ; We had a pretty strong disagreement going there . ; Yep , yep , that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bed004_434	bk	but there is some technology you could try to apply . ; So it 's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr028_384	s	OK . So , anyway I looked at everybody else 's stu ; It 's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression . ; Good . ; But if you search your name , you 'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name .
Bmr027_471	b	and now we 're ; it might ; we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? ; Right .
Bro019_280	bk	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Um . ; OK .
Bro011_645	x	I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models ; and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of ; just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . ; Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .
Bed017_238	s	Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's the same kind of information . ; I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net ,
Bro012_672	s	but it 's been a while ; so maybe I can ask you some questions . ; Oh . ; So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday .
Bmr028_1086	ba	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That would be ft quick ,
Bmr006_456	b	Yeah . ; But it als It it it also I think builds up towards the goal . ; It 's a novelty item . ; Right .
Bmr010_1081	s	Hmm . ; I I I think this year we we actually , uh , can do it . ; Oh , wonderful . ; It 's a we have we have due to @ @ variations in funding we have we seem to be doing , uh , very well on m money for this this year ,
Bsr001_1065	b	And then you do improvement on that particular database . ; So even if we don't collect the data to train models , we should collect data at least to evaluate progress . ; So what would be nice is if we could , uh , converge on on formats and conventions , and so on , ; Yeah .
Bmr001_118	qw	So , so where are we in this ? ; Thanks . ; Let 's see , so we now we now have a few mikes that work . ; How long did it take you to set this up ?
Bmr019_700	%--	Um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , so that was one big factor that helped improve things ; and then the other thing was that ,
Bed011_847	%--	I mean th so there 's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things ; right ? ; You know " I want to go there and I don't care if it 's really hard . " ; Or if you 're an extreme sport person , you know .
Bmr024_818	s	So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . ; Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , uh , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen . ; Yep . ; And everything else was sorta committed .
Bmr007_194	s	I mean , I can't say universally , ; but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , um now , uh don't . ; I mean they they also you know , uh uh , ack acknowledge the influence of sub of subcultural norms and cross - cultural norms and things . ; So , um Then it beco though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed .
Bmr011_802	%--	And there 's a web site that has lots of papers . ; But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what he wants me to do
Bmr012_870	%--	I mean I corrected all ; I mean I hand - edited the whole the whole meeting ; so that can be run ; it 's just
Btr001_255	%--	Oh . ; um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language ; and ; But
Bed004_405	%--	Uh I I 'd No , I was gonna wait until ; Oh , OK . ; So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh Bayes - net , ; that is , you know , with fill
Bmr007_865	s	I I think the there is a a great difference in the in the signal . ; Oh , absolutely . ; So s my intention for this is is as an aide for ground truth . ; Um but eh I but eh I I I mean that eh eh in the in the mixed file you can find , uh zone with , eh great different , eh level of energy .
Bmr028_130	s	I I 'll have done I 'm probably doing something wrong . ; OK . ; Sorry this microphone 's moving around . ; I can't put this over my ear .
Bro011_614	b	so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , the long ones versus the short ones . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_689	b	Um . So the scheme that I drew on the board last time where we tried to , um allow reject models for the s speech from other speakers , ; um , most of the time it doesn't work very well . ; So , um , and the I haven't done I mean , the only way to check this right now was for me to actually load these into X Waves and , you know , plus the alignments , and s play them and see where the ; Hmm .
Bns001_310	s	Mmm . ; I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies . ; So , uh , at the physical level , they 're they 're they are not compatible . ; It 's not a problem .
Bro016_736	no	But let me ask you this . ; What what 's the , um ? ; Do you kno recall if the insertions were were higher with MSG ? ; I don't know .
Bed015_2015	bd	It 's uglier and it d doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff . ; That 's right . ; Uh , ; But whatever .
Bro010_88	cc	They were trying to do something different like taking , uh well , using filter that takes only a past ; and ; this is just a little bit different . ; But I will I will send him an email and tell him exactly what we are doing ,
Bro012_550	b	So um I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with . ; So I guess the question is if you can do better than this . ; If you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down . ; Mmm .
Bmr011_13	%--	so , uh , ; we haven't sent around the agenda . ; So , ; i
Bns001_1566	b	eh also within Siemens ; and also with some project there . ; And I believe your routing stuff is also available , ; Hmm - mmm .
Bed011_1167	ba	I mean I I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment , ; but it probably is . ; OK . ; OK , great .
Bmr022_1219	b	Yeah . ; A few months later they listen to it ; and they say " Ope ! They got that acronym wrong . " ; Yeah .
Btr002_1241	%--	It 's a very different interface , though . ; I mean , it seems very strange . ; Mm - hmm . It is different . ; Well , it w it would it had the benefit of it
Bmr019_1282	ba	even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I guess , we 'll try to write this Eurospeech paper . ; Superb .
Bns002_654	s	They they have the same uh signal uh behavior . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; this is not a problem for us ,
Bmr011_1030	s	I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are ; have a lot of cross - ta ; sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk . ; Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition ,
Bsr001_1314	aa	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro024_1714	b	then you have a bad signal - to - noise ratio and then you you would like to have a stronger smoothing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you could you could base it on your estimation of the signal - to - noise ratio on your actual ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1018	aap	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; We done ? ; With that form .
Bns001_610	b	OK , ; I see . ; so . ; Yeah ? @ @
Bed011_11	s	if not , she won't . ; Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every uh , ; it seems to have about at two minute ; Yeah , I 've I uh it 's not that I didn't try .
Bed008_1231	s	So ; Ah , sorry . ; I guess that 's ; You can technically wear that as you 're talking .
Bro005_1042	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And perhaps doing this for cha changing the variance of the streams and so on getting different scaling ; That 's another possibility if you have time ,
Bmr018_322	s	I am too . ; And I think it 's an empirical question . ; Can't we uh couldn't we just have , um , ; I don't know , maybe this just doesn't fit with the software ,
Bed014_1369	s	Yeah . Great . And then we 're gon we 're gonna ; because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff ? ; So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that . ; Yeah , we could talk tomorrow .
Bmr024_1341	s	What ? ; um , I 'm sorry ; in each case how do you determine , you know , the the usual fudge factors ? ; The , uh the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling ,
Bro012_1324	%--	Yeah . ; Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction is good ; and we could u we could use the fine structure to to have a better estimate of the noise ; but still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of of of
Bro026_16	b	Oh , right , I saw I saw the note . ; You probably received the mail . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_111	%--	Mmm . ; And this we 've not uh worked on this yet . ; Um , yeah . ; And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like
Bmr023_906	b	like two , three times the error everybody else was getting . ; And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned " uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . " ; I said " what offsets ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1238	no	or , um , do them together ? ; Um . ; I I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together . ; I don't know .
Bro022_347	bk	Yeah . ; It might just be some artifact of the processing that that , uh , if you 're ; Uh , yeah . ; Oh . OK .
Bro021_752	s	And , uh , th th that 's where I am right now . ; So . ; Oh . How about you , Carmen ? ; Mmm . I 'm working with VTS .
Bmr016_1101	s	And I stapled them . ; OK . ; Alright so , first of all , um , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures ; and and I can tell you first , uh , to go through the steps
Bmr018_1349	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks .
Bmr015_479	s	Yep . ; I see . ; But but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students , ; and so forth , both at at UW and here .
Bro008_304	b	It 's a novel idea . ; Look at the data . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_442	b	so it would have to go on a P C somewhere . ; Yeah . ; Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_376	b	Well , I mean , I I think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number ; to maybe have two or three numbers , ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro022_136	%--	um , ; and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . ; Uh , ; and for that
Bmr016_244	s	And I think , um , the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups , ; and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we 've done , ; which were done by non - native speakers ; so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set ,
Bmr013_958	%--	but we 'll try it this way and see . ; Yeah . ; I mean it 's probably good enough for force - alignment . ; If it 's not then we 're really then we def definitely
Btr001_2129	aa	so , um , ; let 's see . ; I had something that I could bring up . ; Yes .
Bmr030_661	b	Only . ; OK . So I think we just gotta let things slide for now , ; and see see what 's gonna happen . ; Yeah .
Bed004_596	s	Yeah . ; So that that uh ; i if you had the generalized " Go " X - schema ; and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters .
Bed014_116	s	but he understood it . ; I know what he 's talking about . ; OK . ; But Nancy doesn't .
Btr002_929	b	But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_139	s	I 'll wait . ; So , uh ; But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . ; Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say .
Bmr030_166	b	That 's a good idea . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_893	s	I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; Up to now it 's been monologues , uh , as far my understood .
Bed012_261	aa	versus " the Sony " . ; The Crown ? ; Is that the actual name ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1363	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I don't remember the example ; but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago
Bro017_924	b	And then if you want to decrease the importance of C - one you just take the variance of the C - one component in the in the model and increase it if you want to decrease the importance of C - one or decrease it ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr009_660	s	But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right ; you won't even ; Yeah , This is the This is the the idea , to consider only the the small window near near near the the overlapping zone . ; The portion of the of the backchannel won't won't effect anything .
Bro021_386	d	Tell them about the rest of it . ; Like you said the number of filters might be different or something . ; Right ? ; The number of cepstral coefficients is what ?
Bmr021_834	aa	Yeah . ; That 's something we wanted to do ; If we could figure out how . ; yeah .
Bns001_1727	b	and then get rid of SDH . ; There 's the problem is is , you see that the providers eh have always there broken view for for the management . ; If you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system , and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff , in principle , but you still need it , is eh not aligned . ; Yeah .
Bed003_415	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_717	s	I ; So , OK , it sounds like Markham should almost decide when he wants to do it , and tell us , as long as ; was not , um ; So early next week .
Bro013_305	%--	I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something , ; but uh . ; Yeah . ; I I guess e the only thing with these the Meeting Recorder and , well ,
Bsr001_1842	b	but they they seem to be willing to give us time . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_87	s	because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . ; S So ; Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . ; See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting .
Bro026_140	s	And , uh and what do we freeze ? ; And , you know , what do we ? ; So , um . ; I mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part .
Bmr003_908	bk	And it 's not really strictly comparable . ; So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text . ; The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from ? ; Right .
Bmr023_547	no	Right . I forget how we ended up on this , ; but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything ; and Adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . ; And I don't remember who won , Adam or me ,
Buw001_416	b	But th there is this , um There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time ; but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? " ; And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1340	s	which is that " what do you mean by " merge " ? " ; So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , well , what do you mean by " merge " ? ; Right . ; If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it .
Bns002_369	s	because we well , we we only waste really small time colliding . ; OK , ; OK ? ; but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet between neighboring nodes ,
Bmr031_1197	s	Sometimes there are some some words are cut off ; or there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . ; And so there are more insertions ; but most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one .
Buw001_706	g	the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . ; Right ?
Bmr030_57	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And so this this was , how do you map all that information onto that ? ; a onto the meeting domain .
Bmr025_118	b	Mm - hmm . ; um , which I haven't used , haven't looked at . ; Dan says it 's pretty good ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_55	s	Um . ; Yeah , that 's good . ; And uh ; So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form .
Bns001_590	aa	It 's a project of the UC . ; But first of ; Yeah , ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr015_126	b	OK . ; to match . ; Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? ; Yeah .
Bed009_208	s	which was now the closest point of the road network to ; Yeah . ; OK , geometric center . ; But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter ,
Bro013_434	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bro021_990	%--	No . ; No , no , no . ; It 's not the first space . ; Well , we have pfft , uh , em
Bsr001_2503	s	Ha - wha I mean , we could just make make numbers up , ; and , ; I don't know . ; It 's it 's a different task .
Bns002_153	s	But you can of course ask , " but if the nodes are not moving , what kind of topology changes can we expect ? " ; Yeah . ; That 's it . ; Well , eh , the thing is that usually in in a n in a network of sensors , what we have , or the idea is to have um , an important number of sensors , and maybe with a high filer rate .
Bsr001_1019	s	Keep going , ; keep going . ; Yeah . ; good way of saying it .
Bmr007_1235	aa	Yeah . ; One one question . ; Do you do it on all channels ? ; Of course .
Bro016_1122	b	And so it 's sort of a different way of looking . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_194	s	Yep . ; And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that . ; Right . ; And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes ,
Btr001_2566	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; I think
Bmr010_1141	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_861	s	I mean , if in terms of the t the type ; Yeah . ; But you asked me about uh tools and things ; and um There 's this one
Bmr012_1343	b	Oh I think that would be hard , yeah . ; Yeah , I think just adds ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bns003_347	s	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; So maybe ; I don't know if this is different in Spain . ; That would be fine too , to have some information , or in D nnn Holland .
Bro012_551	b	So I guess the question is if you can do better than this . ; If you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_742	%--	Uh , yeah , a good VAD . ; We put the good VAD . ; So . ; Yeah , I don't know . I I j uh , uh pr
Bmr006_1300	s	No ? ; if they 're right next to one another ? ; If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . ; Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA .
Bmr022_154	s	where you c include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are . ; I don't think we could do it on the mixed signal , ; cuz it ; But on the individual channels that would probably work , if they have enough words in the transcript .
Bns001_1487	b	and you set up some Linux or Free BSD or whatever kind of prototype . ; So that is what I have in mind with that . ; And then OK , and then you will see . ; Hmm - hmm .
Btr001_2249	s	I mean , s I just wanna be sure . ; Or I maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa ; When you end with " so " . ; When you end the utterance .
Bmr012_1322	s	and I want it , ; you know k ; yeah ; see what they 're doing and also present what what we 've chosen as ours and and discuss that kind of thing .
Bmr021_325	%--	So . ; Well , that 's not a sound tool , ; right . ; But since since these files are made to be used with the SRI recognizer ,
Bro027_391	s	That 's good . ; Uh , this is slightly off topic ; but , uh , ; I noticed , just glancing at the , uh , Hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing I don't know Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition .
Bns001_1003	%--	That 's the only thing . ; It 's stored in a WAP cookie , ; much like HTP ; in a cookie and from the WAP gateway
Bmr002_1429	s	Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive . ; That 's great . ; I asked if somebody else wanted the lapel mike . ; Somebody else can take it next time .
Bro021_1034	2	Cuz you cuz you up here you have the A plus B ; No . ; I say if I apply log , I have , uh , log of E is equal to log of , uh in this side , is equal to log of X ; Plus N .
Bmr018_1413	s	Yep . ; Do a trip report . ; yeah . ; Well , the summarization stuff was interesting ,
Bro027_339	bk	Yeah . ; uh ; but it 's still worth , I think , just since you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_658	s	Yeah . ; So it should ; No , but there 's a little difference , ; There 's a lot .
Bro022_372	s	Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , ; but maybe in practice it is . ; Hmm . ; That 's something to think about .
Bmr031_256	b	It 's it 's sort of like in , um , Broadcast News ; and see what the difference is , you know , on the others . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_913	s	" John is on the bus and not on the train . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; " John is on the bus " versus " John is on the train . "
Bmr008_725	s	and being able to ask them follow - ups if we need to . ; For now , ; right ; so it 's I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out ,
Bro012_116	aa	Hmm . ; And so maybe maybe that would be more obvious . ; Spectral slices ? ; Yeah .
Bro004_624	aa	Oh ! So this upper third ? ; So Yeah . ; Uh that 's still noisy ? ; Yeah .
Bed006_708	s	and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema , down there . ; Uh one question , Robert . ; When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ? ; Yeah . It 's the shadow .
Buw001_907	%--	um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna ; n ; I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . ; But but having a small percentage of the data with it ,
Bed016_984	qw	No no , I I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um ; and so you can Castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , ; so you can say " Where is the castle , ; how much does it cost ? "
Bro018_401	s	I mean that they 're s probably working with fixed point or integer or something . ; I think you 're supposed to on this stuff anyway , ; and and so maybe that puts it in the right realm somewhere . ; Well it just , yeah , puts it in the right range ,
Bro012_1060	s	So um . ; This there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? " ; Mmm . ; set uh of features ,
Bed013_1092	b	Well actually more m more the other way around . ; We wanted something that represents uncertainty uh we in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is , for example . ; Some generic information . ; OK .
Bed008_1273	s	right . ; So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E ; given that these guys are ; I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something ,
Bed017_582	b	Right . ; with that FrameNet base . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1203	co	I ; Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ? ; That 's right , ; Well , but you know we have to try .
Bmr011_713	s	Has Don have you s did you si ; I thought you did actually . ; Didn't you read a digit string ? ; I was Yeah , I was I was here I was here before once .
Bmr006_991	x	And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . ; So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort uh , or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time . ; Yeah . ; Context window ?
Bro018_1097	s	I take the current frame and the four past frames and the four future frames ; and that adds up to six seconds of speech . ; And I calculate um the spectral mean , of the log magnitude spectrum over that N . ; I use that to normalize the s the current center frame by mean subtraction .
Btr001_169	bk	And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there . ; Hmm . ; So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back . ; Right .
Bed016_1070	%--	Uh ; Oh , you can do that ? ; Really ? ; Of course that 's that that 's definitely a , uh
Bsr001_754	s	So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power . ; Right . ; I mean , the the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance . ; And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get any better .
Bns001_193	bk	yeah . ; Yeah , but but what is planned is that I do something like a previous , you know , layout , and give everybody the , uh , opin uh , the possibility to the chance to put his content inside ; Sure . ; OK ,
Bns003_586	s	so it 's like I have to sort everything out when I 'm back in Germany ; Yes , ; but you have no ; but I won't go back to the university
Bed006_600	s	Mm - hmm . ; And most of them are going to be Hollywood movies . ; Hmm . ; So , " American Beauty " is " American Beauty " ,
Bmr009_1599	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Now , tha Now , if we develop further then , y uh , I don't ; I mean it 's I think it 's a nice feature to have it set that way .
Bed006_522	aap	But uh ; just make a ; But it 's not like we need to be with them twenty - four hours a day s for the seven days that they 're here . ; Not not unless you really really want to .
Bns002_1514	s	Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it , ; and I got the statement ; uh they are very interested in that . ; They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom
Bmr026_517	s	but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . ; I mean does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and ; Yep . ; So I was assuming he was gonna take over that .
Bed015_19	s	OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . ; So , um , ; So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on ; but I 'll just pass out as is right now .
Bmr028_326	s	Well , it is wonderful . ; It is , for prototyping and user interface . ; It 's just really the language is awful . ; There you go .
Bro027_1330	s	Maybe that they 're a lot worse . ; You know ? ; And , um ; But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow .
Buw001_1686	d	I thought so . ; But they have a verification . ; No , I mean , it 'll be ; Mix ?
Bmr026_978	s	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh it was I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . ; When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh at the time .
Bsr001_1763	s	Um . ; But I mean , i i ; Yeah , ; recording it 's easy .
Bed004_406	%--	Oh , OK . ; So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh Bayes - net , ; that is , you know , with fill ; you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh
Bed013_1007	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , the discourse can maybe tell us w what 's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements . ; And so we can hard code " for opera , look for tickets , look for this , look for that , ; OK .
Bmr024_594	d	projector We were not saying we are not doing it . ; Yeah . ; S ; No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ?
Bed013_1030	b	Yeah , e ultimately that 's also what we wanna get at . ; I think that 's that 's the correct way . ; So , of course we have to keep memory of what was the last intention , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_939	s	And for example w i s I Irena Gurevich is going to be here eh , end of July . ; User . ; She 's a new linguist working for EML . ; And what she would like to do for example is great for us .
Bed005_93	s	That , uh ; yeah , so we might actually , ; um ; S i Jane may say that , " you know , you can't do this " ,
Bro005_1215	s	Yeah . ; but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , ; and using less CPU was better . ; Something like that ,
Bed006_1246	s	or not necessarily ; We would put a new action in the m uh in the categories that in which it has the ; um ; Well , every action has a set of related schemas
Bmr016_1869	s	Thank you . ; Because he was saying , " How many E 's do I have to allow for ? " ; You need a lot of ; What I meant was " beep " .
Bmr026_147	s	So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . ; Uh The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . ; And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . ; So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .
Bmr010_1160	s	Something like that . ; Maybe an elaborate one , ; cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments , ; which will also clear things up .
Bro027_1559	s	I think you were . ; Yeah . ; Does something . ; It doesn't work as well .
Bmr002_1106	s	But , um ; You know , we we may or may not talk before then on that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . I I think we won't probably talk until we have more data ,
Btr001_2383	aap	However , the context fits . ; I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think ; Mmm . ; It 's possible .
Bro019_1319	b	Mmm . ; So . ; Um . ; Mmm .
Bro028_755	qy	I mean , they started off with um , when they were building their system they were always comparing to HTK to make sure they were getting similar results . ; And so , it 's a Gaussian mixture system , ; uh ; Do they have the same sort of mix - down sort of procedure , where they start off with a small number of some things
Bmr029_273	b	So , um , you parallelize across different speakers , ; Mm - hmm . ; but you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh who who speaks a lot , then effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process . ; Right .
Bro023_143	s	Yeah . ; but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can . ; Right . ; And that 's actually what we 're planning to do in
Bmr018_253	b	Well I I I mean , I don't know . ; That was the question . Though . ; So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1124	b	just about the um ; oh yeah , ; I see , ; yeah yeah , really .
Bmr014_336	s	Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now .
Bns001_961	qh	I have a an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS . ; I mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing ; and uh I 'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation . ; I mean , are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology ?
Btr001_2183	bk	um , ; but , I do do that because ; I think partly because I want to make sure that people know that my my thought my utterance is finished , ; Yeah .
Bro019_1568	bk	if @ @ Every root that 's ; Since it 's a real signal , the LPC polynomial 's gonna have real coefficients . ; So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is gonna be a c complex pair , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_465	b	Um , I I haven't I haven't decided on on the initial thing . ; Probably probably something like PLP . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro004_306	h	So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using TI - digits on a TI - digits test . ; OK ? ; Hmm ? ; Um and um
Btr001_1707	s	Yeah . ; And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things , ; those kind of vo vocal cues . ; And sometimes even laughs .
Bed008_308	s	the way we had it designed , ; now we can change the design , ; but the design we had was ; there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations
Bro005_355	ba	Mmm . ; We select these these these tasks ; because it 's the more difficult . ; Yes , good .
Bmr013_1008	s	and , uh , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . ; And this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it . ; Hmm . ; And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike .
Bro018_1194	bk	That 's that 's the ; Uh - huh . ; but uh but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here . ; That 's that 's Yeah , that 's true .
Bns003_730	s	So it 's kind of , uh , dependent on the funding we have in some projects . ; So ; w ; it 's not sure ,
Bro027_589	s	I mean , the LDA ; Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D - uh , VAD ? ; Or ; The VAD use , uh , LDA filtered features also .
Bro024_865	s	Well , see if you add something everywhere , it has almost no effect up up up on on top . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it and it and it has significant effect down there . ; That was , sort of the idea .
Bmr015_396	s	boy , I forget , ; I think , more than , ; uh , ; more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that .
Bmr018_1120	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No I mean , i in in your case , I mean , you were joking about it , but , I mean , your case the fact that your talking about similar things at a couple of conferences , it 's not ; these are conferences that have d really different emphases .
Bed015_1995	%--	or three or four different ones . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz the problem is that then you have to
Bns001_994	s	the terminal has a WAP stick . ; And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick . ; So yeah . ; And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address .
Bed014_437	s	Yeah . ; Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t ; Yeah , I have a busy weekend ; but after that Yeah ,
Bmr014_1110	bk	I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes ; I don't think so . ; and I uh it 's uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email . ; Ah .
Bsr001_1824	s	If you doubt , don't do it . ; Cuz we 're very naturalistic here . ; Yeah . ; But it , um , and there will be a lot of people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people ,
Bmr028_276	s	with at least , like at least with , you know , being able to search over c certain amount of meetings , ; just , like , really basic stuff . ; Just asking fo looking for a word , and looking through a bunch of different meetings . ; And if we have time , I 'll also add , you know , like , choosing which speakers you wanna include , and stuff .
Bmr016_696	qw	Yeah . Exactly , so it 's it 's a ; So . ; yeah . ; So why do you want to do echo cancellation ?
Bro017_1109	s	Yeah . ; And we 'll just ; Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with . ; But then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them .
Bro007_550	ba	I 'm not sure these are great ideas . ; But they 're ideas . ; Yeah ? ; Oh , that was good .
Bro014_1356	%--	because of the first lobe of of each each of the harmonics . ; So this one inclu is a longer Ah . ; So , this is like yeah , fifty milliseconds or something like that . ; Fifty millis
Bed011_375	%--	So let 's do this . ; Let 's plan next Monday , OK , to have a review of what we have so far . ; and ; This means audio , but
Bmr010_1027	ba	And , um , and other than that , it 's w word level . ; But , you know , the fact that they noticed , you know , the " nnn " . " He said " nnn " , not " and " . ; What shall I do with that ? " ; I mean , they 're very perceptive .
Bmr007_604	g	You know , the other thing I was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data . ; Ach . ; So , um I wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um a a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people . ; Right ?
Bed015_305	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; I I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h ; if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know that 's kind of weird .
Bmr019_1279	s	Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point ; and yo then you can bring in the other person . ; So it 's actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal , ; even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order .
Bmr020_1282	qy	Well , OK . ; She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here .
Bmr031_188	s	Because , like like Macrophone wasn't that much data . ; You mean ; Right ? ; And it helped .
Bed011_594	qw	Right . ; That 's enough . ; I don't know . ; What is the uh the the English co uh um cognate if you want , for " Sankt Nimmerlandstag " ?
Bro016_114	bk	for different numbers of states per phone . ; Yeah . ; Um , but , uh , that that 's all I wrote down . ; OK .
Bed008_1313	qy	Now ; Um ; Yeah . ; Is that all OK ?
Bmr015_999	%--	um , aside from the fact that they 're obviously very time - consuming to encode , ; uh , the fact that there was some ; I had the indication from Dan Ellis in the email that I sent to you , ; and you know about ,
Bmr025_71	s	Is my mike on ? ; And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK ; Yeah . ; and we get the transcript back
Bro017_828	aa	Because that would then your model would be unlikely . ; Your likelihood would be low , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_88	bk	OK , so if if everybody can get here at six . ; At six . ; Yeah , I 'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time . ; Six , OK .
Bsr001_1248	b	I mean that you know , that like you said , the fundamental thing is it doesn't have to be this hardware . ; It 's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data ; Right . ; Mmm .
Bmr030_532	bk	Mm - hmm . ; It could be either . ; I mean , there are lots of different places . ; OK .
Bro012_1403	s	Yeah . ; I see . ; S But we could use uh the the noisy version that TIMIT , ; which you know , is similar to the the noises found in the TI - digits um portion of Aurora .
Bed010_740	b	It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism . ; Yeah , ; Oh . Wow . ; yeah .
Bmr016_1791	s	So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are . ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the um , the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language ,
Bmr020_1263	s	And he starts at minute such - and - such , ; and goes on till minute so - and - so . ; OK . ; And then meanwhile , she 's listening to both of these guys ' channels ,
Bro010_763	s	they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections ; and getting some , uh ; Yeah , ; they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate ,
Bed008_1550	b	Right . ; Yeah , sure . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bed004_791	%	So he he dislikes the term . ; Well , I I don't like the term either , so I have n i ; uh ; i i y w i i
Bro028_778	no	They 're they 're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the other , uh , Aurora thing maybe is ; I I dunno if any of this is gonna come in in time to be relevant ,
Bmr025_416	2	Start and end of each ? ; Uh ; Yeah . ; Utterance .
Bmr027_1425	fa	Yeah . Well , I 'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow , ; so this is just a good example of the sort of thing I 'd like to hear about . ; Wait . Why is everybody looking at me ? ; Sorry .
Bed003_1583	ba	I mean but , they 're even like I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc . ; It 's a even distribution . ; Like , ; whatever .
Bmr012_456	s	Right . ; and I guess Ramana , ; so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from ; it 's it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount
Bmr029_252	b	Right . ; Um , because we 're gonna be using the just the male , uh , model ; short training set for the male . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_991	s	I mean w yeah , one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets ; and you have um some reasonable database , ; um ; but then which is um copied over many times with a range of different noises ,
Bmr007_1147	s	The , uh say again ? ; I well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence . ; Something like that . ; Um so , uh I a lot of that was from , you know , what what what you two were doing
Bro017_76	s	Mm - hmm . ; But And French Telecom was saying " no , no , no , ; there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh cannot be protected and you guys will take them , " which probably is also true . ; I mean , you know , it might be that people will take uh uh th the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that .
Bro004_1183	s	Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And so um ; Plus it 's gonna introduce delays .
Bmr022_633	%--	and if the score is good , then you say it matches ; Right , you can also ; In fact that 's what we do ; Right . The individual segments between the beeps
Bmr001_153	no	Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , how much are we talking about here ? ; Um . I don't know .
Bmr025_134	s	I Can I ask a question ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So um as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . ; You can find a searched string and play .
Bed003_650	%--	right . ; We were like " hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , ; OK . ; fifty per " Like , you know .
Bmr006_1457	b	Um . ; So ; Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . ; OK .
Bmr007_1014	b	Two to the number of people in the meeting . ; But Actually , Andreas may maybe maybe just something simpler but but along the lines of what you 're saying , ; Anyway . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_294	ba	a lot of them are ; some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants , ; and . ; So , they 're very competitive ,
Bed009_1050	b	So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level . ; And from there to the appropriate decisions . ; So another one of these primitive , what are called " image schemas " , is uh goal seeking . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_462	aa	We need ; OK , so that will get us through the next couple days . ; We need another gigaquad . ; Yep .
Bro012_541	ar	It doesn't hurt . ; Yeah . ; Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something . ; No .
Bmr022_1323	co	and if it were an acronym , then I would I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things , ; but I wouldn't want them to be changing ; I 'm just ; Imagine that we reverse this
Btr002_2241	s	Mm - hmm . ; It 's that was really surprising to me , that you it 's that tangible . ; Yeah . ; That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too .
Bed015_1242	b	OK . ; May come from a few places . ; but but by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that . ; Right .
Bro028_213	s	Hmm . ; Oh ! ; Um ; That might be the key , actually .
Bmr016_1612	s	yeah . ; Yeah . ; So what is the difference between " papers rustling " and " rustling papers " ? ; IP ,
Bmr001_179	%--	But I 'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative . ; Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps , I would think . ; Yeah . ; It 's just it eh
Bmr002_1036	bk	OK . ; So that , you know , the fact that , yeah , it 's U Penn and all that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_664	b	I don't know if that was in the ; You know , uh ; Start . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_2297	s	Um . ; Including , I mean , every little aspect . ; I and when I tell people what I do here , ; and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " .
Bro024_1303	bk	So there are like some some s some parameters you wanted to use or something ? ; Yeah , ; but ; Yes .
Bed011_142	no	four ? ; one ? ; Tomorrow , ; well we don't know for sure .
Bmr026_416	g	That 's also where we store the The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , ; Oops . ; No . ; right ?
Bmr026_536	s	Right . ; So . ; Right . ; So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave ,
Bro028_528	s	But on this one , ; I I don't know if these are word error rates ; because they 're really big . ; So , under condition one here it 's ten percent .
Bro016_220	b	I don't have this in ; I 'm sure it 's more balanced , ; but it it it wouldn't surprise me if there 's still ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2769	b	So yeah , you 've s they slip through . ; Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice . ; but I 've seen a several " breath " 's too . ; Hmm !
Bmr024_222	s	Hmm . ; maybe he 's gone , ; I dunno . ; He didn't even reply to my message .
Bed011_7	s	OK . ; Alright . ; Yeah , let 's get started . ; Um Hopefully Nancy will come ,
Bed006_1074	s	So uh there 's there 's um a single event of which they are both a part . ; And they 're independently they they are events which have very different characters as far as Source - Path - Goal whatever . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; So when you identify Source - Path - Goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be a desire , whatever , eating , hunger ,
Bed015_333	b	And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum . ; Right . ; And you could get , you know , " the kicked dog " or something like that , meaning " kicked the dog " . ; Right .
Bed013_604	co	Four thousand lines . ; It 's ; I mean . Isn't a isn't it about fifty s fifty five , sixty lines to a page ? ; I d don't quote me on this .
Bmr020_744	s	If you don't know the file names you can't ; Is that a dash or a dot in there ? ; I mean you can ; Don't don't don't say .
Btr002_2929	b	You know ? ; S ; I I think I 've only noticed a couple times where there 's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time . ; Yeah .
Bed016_1000	%--	So you know it 's ; you you can sometimes use " where " f for " when " ; O ; in the sense of , you know ,
Bmr024_237	s	Hmm . ; And , um , I 've prepared , um , uh , a set of five which I 'm which I 'm calling set two , ; which are now being edited by my head transcriber , in terms of spelling errors and all that . ; She 's also checking through and mar and and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber .
Bro012_698	b	A boom . ; Well that that that 's OK . ; But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again , ; Yeah .
Bmr001_42	bk	OK . ; Right and I 'm now talking on microphone number two , ; uh , the wireless microphone number two . ; Yeah .
Bro010_183	s	But ; What were they thinking of changing it to ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low uh , very very very narrow , uh , latency bound .
Bro022_1157	no	And ; Well . I am working in that now , ; Uh - huh . ; but I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful .
Bmr026_830	s	Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower ; and so if ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .
Bro021_1106	ft	Now it 's correct . ; Right . ; OK . ; Thanks .
Bmr007_1229	aa	But I mean if you just replaced it with silence , it 's not clear whether that 's really silence or ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I agree .
Bmr014_93	%--	I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part . ; Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard ; because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated ; and and
Bro023_694	%--	You sometimes will figure out what the noise is ; and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that ; rather than ; and sometimes people
Bed013_854	s	Oh , oh , oh , oh . ; I know , that was horrible . ; I 've blocked every aspect of Phil Collins out of my mind . ; Sussudio .
Bdb001_781	%--	You want sort of a grep that 's that works at the structural on the structural representation . ; You have that . ; There 's a standard again in XML , specifically for searching XML documents structured X - XML documents , where you can specify both the content and the structural position . ; Yeah , but it 's it 's not clear that that 's
Btr002_435	s	you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to " mmm " , you know . ; Nnn , I guess . ; You 're getting the closure of the lips . ; So maybe that 's what they were do getting .
Bmr008_1226	s	but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database ; and if you 're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l uh s uh whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , you could just grep for " role " and and you know , some some particular value . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it sounds like having the facility is great ,
Bmr003_2258	ba	Yeah . ; So ; So what 's the schedule on these things ? ; Wow .
Bmr014_608	qw	But basically that 's one of the main changes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ?
Bro024_326	s	I mean , what do comp what do people do who really face these problems in the field ? ; Well , they have companies ; and they don't tell other people exactly what they do . ; But but I mean , when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this .
Bmr006_423	bk	So . ; I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1171	s	So , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what ; Yeah . Actually all those things could could could could , uh could affect it as well . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one ,
Bro023_479	ar	No , I don't think so . ; Is it on Italian ? ; Y i ; No ,
Bmr007_242	cc	Oh , about how much is it ? ; The the duration of eh of each of the overlaps . ; O oh , what 's what 's the what 's the average length ? ; M I I haven't averaged it now
Btr002_3165	s	I agree . And I think there 's another problem too , ; Yeah . ; OK . ; and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative .
Bmr001_370	s	Uh , there 's one in my office . ; So . ; Right , right . ; They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work .
Bro019_716	%--	I mean the the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits ; where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also . ; It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something . ; The well - matched has also some some mismatch in that which is other than the
Bsr001_1485	bk	Mmm . ; Um , it 's also to a large extent , ; Oh , right . ; Oh .
Bro017_20	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So I guess that what may be a reasonable is if I uh first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1435	b	Yeah . ; uh ; This is this is a schema that defines XML messages that are passed from one module to another , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_212	qw	but , uh ; Yeah . ; I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um , ; how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ,
Btr002_69	no	Now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad . ; That 's what I was just thinking , ; or maybe it was really quiet or something ? ; I don't know .
Bed011_391	b	I mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , ; right ? ; I mean it 's it 's not like ; OK .
Bro019_672	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; So the ; the MM
Bmr024_1630	bk	I haven't done it . ; OK . ; So , uh , the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines , ; Alright .
Bmr003_696	b	And ; so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take . ; D does uh this tool you 're using is strictly ; Yeah .
Bed013_138	qw	No . Let 's we have to we have some some top - down processing , given certain setting . ; OK , now we change nothing , and just say ask something . ; Right ? ; What would it ask ?
Bmr011_1509	b	Yeah . ; with with with potential use from the defense department . ; Well , OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_82	s	I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . ; But in general instead of the word " construct " , th here you might have " meaning " or " form " as well . ; OK ? ; So if there 's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning .
Bmr011_569	b	So ; I mean , it seems ; Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_852	qy	Yeah . ; OK . ; What about these ; And then also , should we go ahead and get another wireless system ?
Bmr020_1104	s	maybe using those as references ; because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters . ; And to get an object You need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech . ; And that 's where your your data would be very important to have .
Bmr024_167	b	That 's what I thought . ; so . ; I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_573	bk	But you know ; so . ; For forced alignment . ; Uh oh oh
Bed013_497	b	And the ad and and the deadline is the fifteenth of June . ; I don't know about it . ; Yeah that 's pretty soon . ; Mmm .
Bro013_215	b	Um . ; So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even . ; So . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_901	%--	Yeah . ; But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer . ; Right . ; But for the purposes of finding the speech
Bed015_1720	b	Yeah . ; No , but there 's there 's a Gricean thing going on there , ; that when you say " I think " you 're actually hedging . ; Mmm .
Bed002_1218	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , ; I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , " Here 's the package , ; here 's the current one we have , "
Bro012_1464	s	They just work on the code book ; and find out the best excitation . ; They work on the code book excitation . ; Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis .
Bmr010_517	g	So that , you cou yo ; Yeah , although the the ; using the close - talking I think would be much better . ; Wouldn't it ?
Bed006_1688	s	but you can definitely figure out where ; Yeah , sometimes things belong and ; So actually I 'm not sure ; I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system .
Bmr023_918	ba	No . It 's just , it it 's it 's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets . ; Or just ? ; Huh . ; It 's it 's , you know , no big deal .
Bro022_471	s	we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it . ; And we were getting these terrible results . ; And then we were talking to somebody and they said , " Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ? ; Everybody knows that .
Bro016_590	%--	Uh . ; Right . ; I mean , again , i if you had the whole system you were optimizing , that would be easy to see . ; But if you 're supposedly just using a fixed back - end and you 're just coming up with a feature vector , w w I 'm not sure
Bmr007_1036	t3	I I have found that when when I I analyzed the the speech files from the , eh mike , eh from the eh close eh microphone , eh I found zones with a a different level of energy . ; Sorry , I have to go . ; OK . ; Could you fill that out anyway ?
Bmr010_1042	s	and I also ; m I ; think they know that the data p source is limited ; and I may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month
Bed009_178	s	even though all the recording is done here ; and so it 's a sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information ; Mm - hmm . ; tells you how to get places .
Bns001_290	s	Uh , maybe I will write a few keywords on the on the whiteboard ; Sure . ; OK . ; Of course , it sounds strange for a company that does UMTS to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to WaveLAN
Bmr011_1449	s	So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group ; but even there he hadn't ; What he 'd said " no " to was for the main meeting . ; But they have several smaller meetings a week ,
Bro026_121	%--	Well , I mean , I think maybe the thing to me might be I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting , ; right ? ; And so ; Mmm , since the meeting ,
Bed011_497	2	mm - hmm Yeah . ; all of these d do have this kind of " tour " um aspect about the way you would go to them . ; And uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a " attend " et cetera . ; Attend ,
Bns002_224	s	At at at a at an at a given moment this eh node , this dash node is is transmitting ; and uh , the arrows are representing this transmission ; and the receiving nodes , these three nodes , are receiving the transmission , ; and I 'm trying to uh show the area , the covered area , for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle .
Bsr001_2546	bk	Huh . ; The projector is much louder than the air conditioning . ; This is the first time we 've done it with a projector . ; Yeah ,
Bro018_981	s	Hmm . ; I mean , ; um , um ; what you can do is um you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one ,
Bed005_618	s	That 's th that was my th first sort of step . ; Mm - hmm . ; I w ; No matter how we want to call it , this is sort of our playground .
Bro003_2077	d	it 's actually sigmoid - X ; Yeah . ; for the ; So if you choose sigmoid it 's o it 's OK ?
Bmr029_955	b	uh , what we wanna do . ; Right . ; This was a business about , uh , um , coming up with something that that was purely prosodic . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_197	%--	So , are we the only ones who are giving demo ? Or is , uh , Washington gonna have a demo too ? ; I could ; I assume . But they 're all doing Communicator stuff . ; or ?
Bed013_1427	b	And , um ; and that 's also maybe interesting for Keith and whoever , if you wanna get some more stuff into the data collection . ; Remember this , we can completely change the set - up any time we want . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_785	s	be um , because that would be interesting ; especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . ; Right ? ; I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for .
Bns001_74	s	Hi . ; and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime . ; So , but , anyway , I would like that Miguel Sanchez will introduce himself a little bit , concerning his background , what he intend to do . ; And Because I discussing with him uh , uh many things concerning , uh , his skills and what the NSA group intends to do .
Bmr002_343	s	" She can't speak ! " ; " It 's terrible ! " ; OK , So um ; Oh , you 're meant You 're meant to speak naturally .
Bmr019_1572	aa	It seems like too many too much coming and going . ; It 's just ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1127	s	We don't have to go into the codes . ; No , I d ; I mean , it doesn't . ; I mean , that not for the topic of this meeting .
Bro023_1675	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; What what what point does the , uh , system stop recording ? ; How much
Bmr010_1200	bd	Excellent . ; I guess there 's another aspect , too , ; and I don't know ; uh , this this is very possibly a different , uh , topic .
Bmr020_1068	b	Mmm . ; And um , that would be , you know one speaker . ; The discourse the people who look at turn taking often do use ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_870	s	But , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say . ; But . Um . So s So if you are a d ; Well it 's very tricky . ; So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities ,
Bro019_1585	s	It 's Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner .
Bmr008_573	b	Just ; and It 's just the wording of it . ; And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_119	s	No . ; Oh ; We have a separate ; They 're separate things .
Bed006_1103	b	and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week . ; OK . ; It 's also a question of the recursiveness and and a hier hierarchy um in there . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1747	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that violates our privacy issue . ; Yeah .
Bed010_348	aap	Yeah , ; that should be fine . ; Yeah , I ; Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .
Bmr029_722	s	Just , you shake them and they fall down . ; They 're popping up . ; Yeah . ; He went to put them on and then something happened .
Bro007_418	s	Uh No mitigation . ; Wow . ; Do you know what no what no mitigation means here ? ; Um it should be the the problem with the error channel error
Bsr001_881	b	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; So , uh , what we what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News . ; Right .
Bro021_738	%--	but @ @ ; S so , I don't know , ; I was h ; I 'm I 'm I 'm , like
Bed010_590	s	And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , ; so I I I ; It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect . ; The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .
Bro003_1973	2	You won't really have these overlapping things and so forth , ; So the targets of the net are these ? ; but ; Articulatory feature .
Bed013_822	bk	Oh , yeah . OK . ; a and outside of it , ; and ; OK .
Bed003_153	bk	It was a long time ago . ; There 's a lot of those . ; But if you looked at it real close , you could see the the in intricacy of the of the walls . ; OK .
Bmr028_1727	s	Right . ; but these are imperfect , ; Yeah . ; because of the f you know , the batteries flaked . "
Bro028_93	b	OK . ; It 's still in terms of computation , if we use , like , their way of computing the the maps the the MIPs , I think it fits , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_780	ar	To set it up and then anonymize it ? ; No , it wa n not , um ; We 're not talking about a movie . ; No , no , no , no .
Bmr015_609	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I 'm a little confused . ; I thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , uh , the the other transcription , uh , thing was that that we were using the mixed file .
Bro012_277	%--	and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone ; and ; Well . ; I did notice uh something
Bmr005_283	bk	And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that . ; Yeah , we really can't . ; But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push finish this off . ; I understand .
Bro023_891	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum , ; but sometimes , of course , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary ,
Bsr001_2587	ba	Mm - hmm ! ; Modern technology . ; Oh , I see . ; Perfect .
Bmr013_874	ba	y it 's and so , um , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that ; but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , ; and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase ; but that 's OK .
Bsr001_1343	b	So like saying , like " Hal ? " ; and that ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_155	%--	and you 'll cycle through all the open applications . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Ah . OK . And then it won't
Bro028_804	bk	Um , it was a poster . ; Or ; Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper . ; Yeah .
Bed003_225	g	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , ; right ?
Bmr007_260	s	and ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to to because the the overlap is , uh on is only the in the final " S " of the of the the fin the the end the end word of the , um previous speaker with the the next word of the the new speaker .
Btr002_1366	bk	and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds . ; Cuz they were reading from a script . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed004_201	s	Uh . ; And um ; So , some some work needs to be done , but I think we can uh ; And this , and in case no you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection .
Bro024_744	%	Yeah . ; And , uh , I I found the same problem . ; Just taking um , what we were used to u use , I mean , uh , some type of spectral subtraction , y you get even worse results than the basis ; Yeah .
Bmr025_903	b	Well I 'm sure there would ; Yeah . ; where like one one button was " uh - oh " ; Yeah .
Bmr026_63	s	Yeah . ; It 's only two ; Yeah . ; As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think .
Bmr018_861	b	That was sort of another possibility . ; You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts , ; or at least a single phrase ; Mmm .
Bed013_811	s	Remember I came in and I started asking you about how we were sor going to sort out the uh , decision nodes ? ; Yes ! ; What 'd you say ? ; I remember you talking to me , just not what you said .
Btr002_708	s	and like not listen to them . ; I do remember those , actually . ; And then you see it , ; and off with the headphones !
Bed005_1422	s	It 's an inter sort of a kind of a it ; The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter ; and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form , ; and if you say , " hey , we 're gonna make a different kind of data structure to stick in there "
Bmr012_985	s	I don't know . ; I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . ; I I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort ; because it 's one board with two digital channels .
Bro026_287	b	Uh . ; There 's a question about exactly how we do it . ; We probably will go to something better later , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1146	bs	yeah . ; Yeah . ; Which makes sense , ; but , uh , you 're saying Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy .
Bed014_1270	%--	Yeah . ; OK . So has he been been involved with this , ; Just maybe not today . ; or ?
Bmr026_342	s	Oh . ; And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room , ; they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . ; And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .
Btr002_254	s	" That would be a problem . So . " ; Right . ; It it ; I think the second one where the " so " is all by itself , it 's like , " So that would be a problem . So . "
Bed005_55	s	and get them interested in stuff . ; That 's a good idea . ; And , um . ; So that 's as far as our brainstorming was concerned .
Bro004_341	b	Um . Yeah . ; There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA ; is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition . ; Mmm .
Btr001_581	%--	you could switch signals , ; like you could listen to a different one , ; Mm - hmm . ; but you couldn't really
Bmr001_57	s	Then there 's ; I know , but yeah . ; It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out . ; This is at the middle of the table
Bed017_147	s	And so ; this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . ; And ; So I tried to construct the dependency models ,
Bmr015_264	aa	so it 's ; Yeah . ; So the moderator actually did repost it . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_317	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , he was in s ; He wasn't there at cof ; Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him .
Bed003_267	s	So . The mode basically has three different outputs . ; The probability whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter . ; Um The " context " , we simplified . ; Basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown .
Bro017_40	s	And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " . ; Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either , ; Right . ; cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months
Bmr002_294	s	and and I approved . ; Mm - hmm . ; but I think that I was uh proposed before I was asked ? ; And that doesn't matter
Buw001_2290	ba	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Perfect .
Bro017_287	qw	And ; Well how do you how do you uh convert this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ? ; It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , time t ; Yeah but what 's the number ?
Bro024_983	s	because it 's a it 's not a symmetric filter anymore . ; This is for the LDA ? ; Yeah ; so so this this is like So this makes the delay like zero for LDA
Bmr009_1227	%	And and had he had a pretty noticeable drawl . ; OK , so . I propose , take out Northern add , don't know . ; Oh . Yeah . I I would say more more sweepingly , " how would you characterize your accent ? " ; Yeah .
Bed014_894	s	Usually , he can . ; Usually he has no real constraints . ; So ; And the NTL meeting moved to Wednesday ,
Bmr009_210	ar	Interesting ; Here I I ; Oh that yeah that 's a good q ; in No I I I haven't the result
Bro013_671	s	So , um . ; Yeah . ; Just ; that 's about it .
Bmr027_837	s	But but , no . This was different . ; Ins - in the mail , there was a ; Oh , just a button . ; uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail .
Bro005_989	s	Yeah , if you i i It 's interesting thought ; maybe if you just trained up ; I mean w yeah , one one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets ; and you have um some reasonable database ,
Bro027_2009	%--	I guess , just ; I mean , you guys should probably meet . ; And maybe Barry Barry will be around . ; And
Bmr024_1190	aap	And ; Yeah , I got confused by the results . ; It sai because uh , the meeting before , you said " OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent " . ; That was on males .
Bmr026_913	d	Right . ; Well , that was that . ; And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system ; and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ?
Bed015_979	%--	or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . ; There 's there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on . ; Mmm . ; Now I don't know whether
Bro018_465	%--	Um , So that 's going on . ; And also , just uh working on my uh final project for Jordan 's class , ; uh which is ; Actually , let me
Bro003_1223	s	Depends on the corpus . ; Yeah . ; How big is the net ? ; For Albayzin I trained on neural network ,
Bed009_675	bk	Yes ; OK . ; It could be y ; Sure ,
Bmr031_1402	s	Right . ; I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do . ; In the Aurora thing , we have we have a little bit of a handicap in that they they don't let you , uh , adjust the tis the statistical models . ; So y you have to you have to do everything at the feature level .
Bro003_1721	s	What was it ? ; What was happening with his thing ? ; He was running through these models very quickly . ; He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was ,
Bmr026_1159	s	I was wondering uh you know what size net I should ; Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? ; Uh , how much training data ? ; Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set .
Bro023_1341	s	but , mmm ; By how much ? ; it ; It 's around three percent , um , relative .
Bmr028_136	s	I can I can do that ; but there 's no orientation where the ; Darn ! ; Anyway . We 'll all watch Liz play with the mike .
Bed015_1014	s	OK , side one . ; Yeah . ; Now we 'll go back to s ; OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it ,
Bmr009_129	aa	um sampled ten minutes randomly . ; Right , OK . ; So then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence . ; Yep .
Bed003_850	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; So we would have ; What does it mean , then , that we have to
Bmr031_235	ba	Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is . ; H how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus ? ; A test set , training set division ? ; I mean , it it 's really weird .
Bmr020_731	s	Um actually Oh and this directory , is not readable . ; It 's only uh , accessible . ; So , in other words , to access anything under there , you have to be told what the name is . ; So that 's sort of a g quick and dirty way of doing access control .
Bro026_1067	s	I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . ; You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there .
Bed005_170	s	S ; Yeah . We ar we can sh er I can show you the templates . ; The former end g " ; I I also have it running here ,
Bmr002_512	s	Oh , it 's very common . ; So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them ; Yeah . ; and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost ,
Bed016_872	s	I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes ; Oh , the thesis ! ; it 's just for one guy . ; Oh , I meant this ,
Bmr006_1345	b	Yeah . ; Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_58	s	Um . So , w what follows ? ; At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? ; No . ; We had spoken w about this before
Btr001_2480	%--	Yeah . ; Definitely . ; Mmm . ; It 's hard to
Bro004_630	b	Mm - hmm . ; and , well , the ; I see . ; Mmm .
Bro012_1441	s	Mm - hmm . ; and and getting a very good handle on the features . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing
Bns001_845	g	OK , OK , well , they will I didn't want to get a discussion now . ; And it 's really , really ; yeah ; You know ?
Bro022_426	qy	we have the new LDA filters , ; and ; I think , maybe I didn't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . ; Uh , eh Do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component ,
Bmr028_176	no	I 'm not sure whether you wanna do the demo live anyway , ; or just screen shots of what we have . ; The problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load , that , um ; I don't know .
Bro010_709	b	You 're saying , cheat . ; But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1008	%--	Yeah . ; I mean , you have , uh , uh , variance only , ; so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , um , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture . ; So it 's
Bro018_280	ar	I will do that . ; The targets for the neural net , uh , they come from forced alignments ? ; But ; Uh , no .
Bed010_294	s	and they r they they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , ; what what we have been thinking about , ; and they 're more than willing to to um , cooperate , by all means . ; And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal " group - ware " server at EML ,
Bmr028_404	ba	Er OK . ; I couldn't find the the keywords for things that I thought I had said wrong . ; So . ; It 's hard to find .
Bed003_1752	s	except we st I think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard , ; just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . ; Mm - hmm . ; But um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further
Btr001_1521	b	and I think that that 's by intention , that @ @ not just me who thinks that it 's that proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business ; Mm - hmm . ; and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it . ; Mmm .
Bns002_1378	%--	However , eh you know I 'm just doing this presentation ; uh some somehow a review of my previous work . ; I know , yeah . ; So eh this eh doesn't mean that
Bmr027_122	no	That makes it easy . ; We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want . ; OK . ; I just didn't remember ,
Bro027_19	%--	let 's see . ; Yeah , Barry 's not here and Dave 's not here . ; Um , I can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU . ; This is for
Bro026_229	%--	because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . ; And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects ; but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . ; So we have to start
Bed015_1564	%--	You know , which which , uh you know , you you you ; You could do that . ; for instance , um ; So , I guess ,
Bmr031_211	s	Um , and ; n you know , it 's just basically , ; uh uh ; You know , I I don't have to time to to do too much these days
Bro003_111	bk	Won't even do that . ; I mean , just go down Martin Luther King . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_414	s	Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd I shouldn't say that . ; Yeah . ; They uh that , you know , i if you say " Optional " then it 's sort of ; if people who get nervous about the age question then they realize that " Oh well , but they 're not trying to ask me lots of things . "
Bro027_1515	b	I mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . ; Yeah . ; I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_713	s	You haven't seen new disks pop up , ; have you ? ; Nope . ; I was wondering if they were in .
Bmr030_122	b	he ; Right . ; I think the problem was that , I was t saying " hit Alt Tab " with the assumption that he knew what I meant . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1871	ba	and being , like , " What 's this ? ; This ? " ; You know , and then doing the sounds , ; Aw !
Bmr008_1604	b	You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold , ; right ? ; and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked " SPK " , and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them , ; Uh - huh .
Bns003_415	bk	Uh , yes , ; eh But ; I see there your point . ; OK .
Bro018_1051	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer ; which sort of implies that the networks are bushier ,
Bro018_37	s	The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature . ; Uh - huh . ; the with the new code . ; And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum ,
Bed016_251	bk	That 's done . ; Mmm . ; You have to change those strategies , ; OK .
Bed008_805	s	Well you tell me , ; so in terms of the uh planner what 's what 's a good one to do ? ; Well let 's th this ; go there or not I think is a good one .
Bmr005_633	bk	So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , ; but you have you have time uh , uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it . ; Yeah . ; Got it .
Bro003_867	s	And the French from France . ; OK . ; Yeah , ; the No , the French is f yeah , from , uh , Paris ,
Bns001_1376	s	And if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money . ; Yeah . ; That 's just the same question just other way around . ; Let let me put an example .
Bmr002_292	b	Cuz Morgan said he asked you . ; Oh , uh he did . ; and and I approved . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1163	aa	which ; uh , uh , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one , ; but ; Yeah .
Bed016_562	s	And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . ; And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , ; that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors ; so that all of the projections of it also should work .
Bmr009_584	ba	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a research effort in and of itself , ; Yeah , it would be interesting .
Bmr008_1104	s	So th so the sorts of questions I had were one Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting , ; I mean , will we re will we require it . ; I would tend to leave that e spontaneous , ; I think that e at the stage of uh Uh , sc scanning the transcripts after they 've been produced by by our by IBM , At that point , I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important ,
Bro027_1783	%--	OK . ; That 's a good point . ; Yeah . ; Now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that I I I The the fact
Bmr020_1303	ba	since as you say you have to do stuff with the other end anyway . ; Yeah . ; Well yea ; OK , good .
Bmr031_1228	s	Yeah , you 're both , you know , sort of He 's he 's coming back to the heartland ; and ; Yeah , right , exactly . ; I did my tour of the heartland .
Bed002_1284	s	So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . ; Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building , ; Mmm . ; which is what they do now .
Bro004_1255	%--	i w Or something ; but I mean it 's ; That 's right . ; But something that
Btr002_1454	bk	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something , ; OK .
Bed016_533	aa	and I don't think it 's there yet , ; about we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . ; Is that in there ? ; Yeah ,
Bed006_1057	s	and then I get a commercial action which takes place in a bakery , ; right ? ; Uh - huh . ; and and and they they are obviously , via identifiers , identified to be the same thing here .
Bmr031_1434	s	So that 's good . ; Right . ; So these offices are being , uh , very busy ; Don 's and the one across from him .
Bmr015_633	s	um , ; having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I did discover a couple other things by doing this though ,
Bmr010_1431	s	And that 's just a data reduction step , ; so that you 're not trying at every time interval . ; OK . ; And so those are the putative places where he tries .
Bro005_386	2	Yeah , it 's ; Yeah . ; the French and the Spanish . ; The Spanish .
Bmr009_1427	%	Yeah . ; Is that a real accent ? ; Sure , yeah ! ; Yeah .
Bro021_404	aa	Uh , so the the right now , the the system that is there in the what we have in the repositories , with uses fifteen . ; So ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_721	bk	they nnn they they they didn't ; I 'm not too experienced with harmonics ; they think that the experience is not enough to ; I see .
Bmr002_1167	%--	Um . ; so . ; That 's what I want . ; Of course , there are different kinds of recos
Bro027_1028	qw	What is the ; You said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? ; Mm - hmm . ; What 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ?
Bed002_809	co	OK . ; And then ; Or after the fourth . ; Some find @ @ Forget that for now .
Bmr005_57	%--	Um , I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit , ; maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , ; uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that that uh that uh Jane had with Lokendra ; uh about some some some um uh work about
Bmr016_1168	b	I don't remember . ; OK . ; So so it might not have been It might not have been you , ; Hmm .
Bmr030_605	s	Where you could send them audio files over the web ; and they send you back text files over the web . ; Really ! ; I should look that up again .
Bmr026_905	b	But but yeah certainly if we , um ; If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . ; I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1166	b	So that might actually be useful but they 're all non - native speakers . ; So we could compare before and after ; and see ; Yeah .
Buw001_498	b	Mm - hmm . ; I think it serves two purpo purposes . ; One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_579	s	without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters , ; and ; Uh - huh . ; Well there are slight modifications ,
Bmr030_358	ba	Yeah , it 's done now . ; And , how was it ? ; She said it was much faster . ; Great .
Bed011_627	b	" Who is the the tour is the person ? " ; So it might be a tourist , ; it might be a business man who 's using the system , who wants to sort of go to some ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_365	b	Oh , OK so we just have to c wander around and collect them up . ; Yeah , yeah . ; I think we have three of those . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_508	b	what is here , ; what is there , ; what is " ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_96	s	because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; And uh we will run again
Bmr009_1335	no	Is it Midland Midland Midland , Texas or Midland , Kansas ? ; Is " Midwest " one word ? ; Y yeah , one w ; I forget .
Bro022_961	s	So , we substr I subtract more , um , noise than the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . ; So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . ; And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , ; and I also try different , uh , noise , uh , values
Bmr008_850	b	I don't know . ; Oh that 's interesting . ; from five to fifteen or something , is a ; yeah
Bro024_719	b	But the but the , uh , forty - seven point nine percent which you have now , that 's already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal . ; Yeah . ; So we had forty - four percent in the first proposal . ; OK .
Bed006_349	2	OK . ; so . ; OK . ; Talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on .
Bsr001_944	s	Like ; Yeah . ; I yeah , ; But the but the worst the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all .
Bmr003_1012	b	But it 's gonna be horrible . ; They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this . ; What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ? ; Right .
Bdb001_106	aa	whatever you want . ; So you 're essentially defining a lattice . ; OK . ; Yes ,
Btr002_879	b	Oh . I see what you 're saying . ; OK . OK . ; I 'll move it move the line back . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_472	s	But we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that . ; Yep . ; I could certainly see it going either way . ; Yeah , that would be good to know ,
Bro003_1090	s	and and , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; So , what it it blows out is the number of uh testings . ; And , you know and the number of times you do that last part .
Bro012_483	fa	Well I don't I 'm not talking about the baseline here . ; Oh . Oh . ; I ; I 'm sorry .
Bro012_1353	bk	It it i ; Uh . Has not . ; has not , ; yeah .
Bmr010_286	s	So . ; I also wanted to be sure ; I mean , I 've I 've seen the ; this this is called Praat , PRAAT , which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something .
Bmr016_569	s	um , it 's pretty preliminary in terms of ASR results ; because we didn't do anything fancy , ; but I think e just having the results there , ; and pointing out some main conclusions
Bmr012_317	ba	right ? ; There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . ; Yeah . ; Oh , interesting .
Bed004_313	b	because I was I I took I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out ; so what I did was I took ; I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector . ; Yep .
Bmr019_1142	s	But tha that 's good to know . ; Was thi it 's Chafe ? ; So maybe we should talk ; Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development .
Bmr007_894	b	In the PDA . ; Absolutely . ; Yeah , no question . ; Yeah .
Bed010_303	s	the , uh ; If I find someone at in EML that is interested in that , um I I may even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them ; because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . ; And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction .
Bmr007_237	%	I was about to ask ; Yeah , yeah , I h I have this that infor I have th that information now . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2735	s	break it up more finely . ; Yeah . ; But if you can clearly hear pauses and there 've not been transcribed , we should be adding the commas or not ? ; Though the one I 'm working on now is like that .
Bro003_1793	s	So , ; um ; And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , ; uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it .
Bed013_1012	qw	or look for Mozart , look for thi " ; but the smarter way is to go via the ontology ; and dynamically , then look up u stuff . ; OK . But you 're still doing look up so that when the person So the point is that when the person says , " where is it ? " then you sort of say , let 's go back and look at other things and then decide ,
Bmr008_1430	b	OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal . ; Right , right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed008_1203	s	Yeah , but ; Uh ; HTML ? ; Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing
Bmr028_645	s	Uh , do we know about disk ? ; and ; But th ; Oh , yeah . There 's that pressure .
Bmr028_1048	ba	Yeah . That 's an interesting ; because I think it would be a pretty big difference . ; When you listen , you can sort of tell where people are , ; It 's a big difference .
Buw001_2262	s	or ? ; Hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics
Bmr023_567	no	but some people might be really interested ; and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . ; You decided you were whispering Satanic incantations under your breath when you were ; Well , I don't know what happened to the small heads thing ,
Bed005_1017	s	Wri - write it out for for ; Yeah . ; I mean ; Enter ,
Bmr019_1371	s	That would be pretty pretty ; i it has ; Yeah . ; S That wouldn't work .
Bns001_1684	%--	and and so on , ; but for me , you have not the end to end parts of for for IP functionality . ; We are far away from that . ; And if you take a really look to the GPRS protocols texts and I believe also they apply for UMTS but I 'm not
Bed015_1414	%--	OK . ; and to think that there are , um , ; That comes in ; discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , " oh , when you focus something " then
Bro022_1193	aa	I mean , you can just sort of normalize the ; No . ; We could normali norm I mean , remove the median . ; Yeah .
Bro024_759	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So here here I mean , I found that it 's if I changed the noise estimate I could get an improvement . ; So that 's so it 's something which I can actually pursue , is the noise estimate .
Bmr018_810	s	One is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments . ; Another one was to try to get ; somehow align Thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have . ; But then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation .
Bro013_321	s	So th so so we have a couple a couple little things on Meeting Recorder ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers .
Buw001_1508	bh	I I 'm not so sure I agree with that . ; But ; It But it may well ; Really ?
Bmr010_1370	b	But if you included , uh , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr030_413	%--	Then maybe it would be OK . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; And then we could send If if we had that process down , of putting the audio onto tape ,
Bmr021_639	aa	doesn't need to reflect everything , ; yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr025_185	bk	So , uh ; Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable . ; Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format . ; Right .
Bmr003_2406	bk	In in theory . ; but I mean that 's fine . ; That 's that 's what it does , ; OK ,
Bmr008_588	s	so . ; Somebody 's gonna have to do some data ; Well , there could be a circle one . ; It depends .
Bed006_927	b	Yeah . ; The way we absolutely have those means that are even part of the M - three - L A API , ; Oh great . ; s Uh - huh .
Bro005_335	b	And the multi - English , does ; uh ; So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_557	s	You don't even ask . ; I I there are huge differences you know in the others ; what ; Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down .
Bmr026_849	qw	Not all of ; No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . ; The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that . ; A fifth of it is how much ?
Bro004_466	s	And then the lower part is for Italian ; and it 's the same the same thing . ; So , so the upper part is training TI - digits ? ; So . It 's it 's the HTK results , I mean .
Bmr011_1399	s	Yeah . ; And I 'm willing to try to learn . ; I mean , I 'm I would do my best . ; Um , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,
Bmr012_850	co	Yeah , it 's it 's really not a problem . ; and I 'll rerun it with ; Actually , no . ; Don't stop .
Bro007_353	b	so if we can know what how many words are in each ; and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed008_234	s	OK . No no no , ; No , that 's that 's a ; EVA . ; Missed that one .
Btr001_1536	b	and I had a lot more ideas , like you were saying , hypotheses of what 's going on ; Huh . ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2350	b	which are sort of semi - conventionalized , ; but you wouldn't think that you would write them down . ; Yeah , the one I kn I kn get all the time is " tsk " ; Yeah .
Btr002_573	bk	Cuz , you know , telephone transmissions , um , there 's some filtering going on . ; You don't hear the full the full band of frequencies . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bro004_210	bk	So let me let me ; Um , so , um ; Mmm . ; OK , fine .
Bro028_298	s	Um , ; well , you can argue , that , uh that this is not speech , ; Yeah . ; so the ear is not trained to recognize this .
Bns002_1024	s	and eh every routing de decision is eh just eh looking up the table , ; and sending to the proper neighbor node ; and , eh the other the other set of protocols are using a reactive uh approach ; and these protocols are trying to work on demand ,
Bmr019_794	s	Oh , it was painful ; because the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common , ; so ; And you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech .
Bmr009_748	s	That might be good enough . ; Yeah . ; and Um ; It 'd be worth a try .
Bed013_279	s	Yeah , i that would the g the bald guy . ; Oh ! My advisor ! ; And um . ; so this is just an idea that 's floating around
Btr001_2330	s	and then after the laugh they say , " uh " . ; I mean , ; if you ; so it 's like , " ha - ha - ha
Bmr016_698	no	yeah . ; So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? ; Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation ; which I don't know enough about to talk about .
Bmr002_1404	s	I mean , I suspect My normal s . ; Why ? ; I don't know why . ; I had noticed that you were talking quietly ,
Bmr021_707	s	and uh , um . ; So , first , uh , you know , we had we figured out sometime last week how to um ; and and Chuck wrote this really nice little script Perl script that takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c so - called uh cepstra file , ; which is what the SRI system uses to read features .
Bro017_348	qw	Yeah . ; But it 's but for but for instance , th uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it . ; Hmm . ; Is what 's happening
Bmr005_1142	s	Um , that 's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , ; and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and and uh goes to infinity . ; So it 's so there 's there 's there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents ; I mean there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .
Bro018_512	s	Yeah , you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is , you could maybe take some subset and you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand ; and then see how different it is from you know , the canonical ones , ; Right . ; just to get an idea a rough idea of h if it really even makes a difference .
Btr001_24	s	thanks very much for coming . ; OK . ; So um ; let 's see ,
Bed009_676	s	OK . ; It could be y ; Sure , ; ye yeah I I think that 's that 's the um concept that people have ,
Bmr019_316	b	That would be the , sort of probably the safest way to do ; I might have to do that anyway to to do ; because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right . ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_1462	t1	n ; I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . ; And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . ; Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me .
Btr001_1754	s	And you can ; Um , ; cuz everyone 's laughing . ; Someone has just said something funny
Bro011_561	s	This is ; that I looked at ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now .
Buw001_1337	b	So , I don't I don't know . ; Well , I That 's hard to generate ; Do we ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1165	s	Oh , right . ; W would not be ab able to observe ; What ? ; I if it 's a a a discar Discourse Initial Phrase , we will have nothing in the discourse history .
Bmr014_1131	s	I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . ; The problem is a lot of them are really short , ; Well ; and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line .
Bns002_52	s	and ; uh ; Maybe it was my fault that I assumed that the pointer of Miguel concerning UMTS services was deployed to everybody , ; but it was only sent to me ,
Bmr008_75	qw	Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other . ; So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels . ; and may need some help to translate what that means . ; How fine a resolution do you need on that for this ?
Bed010_453	b	OK . ; Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr028_1551	s	Right . What would this be like if w it were perfect ? ; If someone else ; If this component were perfect ? ; Right . Eh or w But we really can't work on that problem .
Bmr019_314	%--	Or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings . ; Right . ; That would be the , sort of probably the safest way to do ; I might have to do that anyway to to do
Bed011_345	b	Although , obviously th so so that sa s does suggest that ; Uh , now , I have looked at all the data , and it 's pre it 's actually at least to an amateur , quite redundant . ; That that it was it was very stylized , and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing . ; Yeah , Yeah .
Bmr020_741	%--	Beta ? ; And then then in there I have a file that lists all the other files , ; so that someone can get that file and then know the file names and therefore download them . ; If you don't know the file names you can't
Bmr002_726	s	I I I 've got no idea what that 'll look like . ; Right . ; but ; Well I know that I know that um the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce does not come out in STM format .
Bmr006_1295	b	Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_115	s	you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , " the big th " , you you know , " the big the tall dark man " , you know , " walked into the room " . ; Mm - hmm . ; But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind ; but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal ,
Bmr027_1121	s	Well , but ; But but ; And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . ; But we don't I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow .
Bed006_337	s	Like so So it 's just based on like the materials you had about Heidelberg . ; but I I imagine I 'll c just catch on . ; Um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data ? ; Based on the web site ,
Bns001_243	b	Yeah . ; No , this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks ; OK ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr030_421	no	Yeah . ; I mean It would Once we got it set up it w it ; Well , u u ; So , I don't know where the bottleneck was .
Bed014_924	s	To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible . ; OK . ; But I mean . I don't know . ; Whatever .
Bro022_636	%--	maybe a little worse . ; Ye ; with the SRI system , ; I
Bns003_777	s	and , uh , ; in the relation of USAIA I also have the activities with Georgia Tech . ; They have now a PHD . ; It is settled ,
Bmr026_3	s	Yeah . ; OK , we 're on . ; So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , ; three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .
Bmr016_406	s	Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it , ; but then you don't get the the same effects . ; Yeah . ; Well , what I mean is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically ,
Bns003_470	%	A page , we have discuss dis this discussed still a couple of months ago ago . ; I think the best solution is really to put a link on the ICSI page to this stuff . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr016_774	ba	because the way people filled out names is different on every single file ; so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . ; Right . ; Cool .
Bmr006_1413	b	It was yeah , it was interesting . ; But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . ; And you can't just always go , " well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up " . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1204	b	We don't care . ; Yeah , or you can split it up . ; So , y ; Hmm .
Bdb001_967	b	We 're about done . ; yeah , ; wrapping up , ; Hmm .
Bmr019_1085	b	That 's r ; So , we will try . ; don't do as I do . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1423	bk	It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . ; So that 's why it doesn't add up down ; I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker . ; OK .
Bro003_538	b	uh . And that 's something you could ask , ; Mm - hmm . ; but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_290	%--	And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling ; Right . ; Right . ; and it really ,
Btr002_1512	s	Cuz I noticed when Jen and I have totally different resolutions , ; Maybe we do . ; cuz hers moves so much quicker than mine , ; I tend to make it move fast .
Bmr010_501	s	Hmm . ; Fantastic . ; So . ; Cuz there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic , um , channel identifier .
Bro023_1602	bk	Right . ; So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , uh , something that might be better . ; But ; OK .
Bns003_551	bk	I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that . ; Yeah . ; Huh ! ; OK .
Btr001_433	b	Much different . ; A lot of the pronunciations are different , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1553	cc	Yeah . ; This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on . ; OK . ; OK . Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see
Bmr007_993	b	I ; to make marking easier . ; Or ; Yeah .
Bed003_247	s	right ? ; Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry . ; Right . ; Or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place .
Bro024_246	%	and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ? ; Can ; I think what they do is they do it always on - line , ; Go ahead .
Bro026_943	s	You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . ; I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . ; Yeah . ; And you 've been thinking about it more now ,
Bmr006_1432	b	All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , ; Interesting . ; I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_136	s	Adam , Dave , and I , we did , ; for that dialogue ; and I trained it on that . ; And I did some pre - segmentations for for Jane .
Bro018_98	s	Yeah , yeah . ; Right . S ; S ; Well , I can also th use this .
Bmr016_616	b	Right . ; That 's ; Yeah sure . ; Yeah .
Bed015_369	s	You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . ; So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations , ; Mm - hmm . ; those could intersect with these
Bed015_1064	s	And I changed to " reference " ; cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . ; And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . ; For instance , I know it 's going to be plural .
Bro005_1308	bk	Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could . ; right ? ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1112	s	Is is there any way we can have you know like a a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wanna talk that ; I mean ; That 's a good idea . ; That 's not a dumb question ,
Bmr018_816	s	Well , I guess I I wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments ; because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , you know , actual numbers . ; Like if we if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper . ; It 's not that we need it to be automatic .
Buw001_937	s	I think it it it will again depend on Landay , ; and if he has a student who 's interested , ; and how much infrastructure we 'll need . ; I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it .
Bmr029_665	bk	right ? ; when he creates these . ; Right . Exactly . ; OK . OK .
Btr002_246	s	" So . " ; And how does it change the meaning ? ; What 's what are the two different meanings there ? ; It seems like because if I was just reading that thing , I would say , " So that would be a problem . So . "
Bed015_1642	s	Really ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; You 're kidding . ; There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption .
Btr002_1304	s	But i it was , um , really rather minimal . ; I mean , I I like that interface . ; Very efficient , ; and really is , um I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins .
Bed006_1242	%--	right ? ; Right . ; So if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category . ; Then this category would we would put it
Bro007_248	s	It it d ; but sometime the sentence have only one digit ; Seven digits . ; and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that .
Bed006_1171	b	Every SPG every SPG action either is an Enter or a View or an Approach , ; is it change ; Right , right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_768	%--	Uh - huh . ; But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the K or whatever and a little bit of the R . ; Mm - hmm . ; So
Bmr009_1034	s	Yeah . ; Um And I don't know how they filled that out . ; But th if Midland ; Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess .
Btr002_3003	s	I shouldn't do that so often . ; I 'm sorry about that . ; They do this sound , ; and then there 's a pause ,
Bed015_1804	g	we just won't deal with sarcastic people . ; Yeah , I mean ; I don't really know what like ; We we don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ?
Bed006_1282	s	You didn't tell me to ; also for a while for ; Uh - huh . ; But now you guys have seen the light .
Bro027_1753	%--	Or you can say , " It 's silence ! ; Go away ! " ; I mean , ; I mean , i
Bmr006_1125	b	Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . ; It makes sense to start with the simpler signal ; because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . ; Yeah .
Bro013_13	s	So . ; Um . What are we talking about today ? ; Uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh Meeting Recorder digits that we tested . ; Oh , yeah . That was kind of uh interesting .
Bed006_375	%--	th the q first question for the subject is , " so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . ; Is there anything that interests you ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; And the person can say " yeah , sure sh
Bro018_446	s	Oh ! ; Just briefly , or Or anything else ? ; um uh Yeah . ; So . I I guess some of the progress , I I 've been getting a getting my committee members for the quals .
Btr001_1060	aa	Yeah . ; Huh . ; yeah . ; I agree .
Bmr005_841	b	I 'll be in touch . ; Thanks . ; S See ya . ; Yeah .
Bro013_218	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah it it 's not that surprising . ; But to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh ; Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number ,
Bro026_426	s	Yeah , probably . ; Some kind would be good . ; You know ? ; I would think .
Bmr021_757	s	They subtract ; Doesn't matter ? ; No , just would be a sign change . ; Except you get a lot of negatives the other way .
Bed010_1027	bk	Great . ; I 'll let you know . ; S I 'll send you email . ; OK .
Bmr002_474	ba	We don't have to give them money ? ; Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for you know . of some of some sort . ; Oh , you do have to pay them . ; Awesome .
Bro026_589	bk	OK . ; Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , uh , all the digit stuff , uh , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the ; Mm - hmm . ; Sure .
Bmr021_557	b	That 'd be good . ; So that 's what I was saying . We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr001_506	s	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; and ; and it 's hard to catch what it is
Bro003_1676	%--	Good . ; Um . ; So , I guess , ; yeah , th the other topic
Bmr003_1773	s	It 's something you wanted to indicate that it that I this was the end of the phrase , ; this was the end of that particular transcript , ; but it was continued later . ; And I picked up with an ellipsis .
Bed015_1390	s	is that where you would sa ; I mean , that 's ; OK , that 's where the information structure is ; which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this .
Bmr031_719	bk	shuffle it around . ; Mm - hmm . ; because that takes about a day to get off back - up tape . ; Oh .
Bmr008_1713	s	sorry . ; Yeah . ; What what happened with the different contexts ; because eh eh you are talking about eh the period or the the duration of the the window to eh the the long of the window to to consider normalization
Bmr010_263	%--	And they basically said they have they have , uh , a tool they developed themselves ; and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone , ; and had it 's not supported , ; a a a and
Bro014_58	s	maybe I should write it on the board . ; So , there 's four rounds of training . ; Um , ; I g I g I guess you could say iterations .
Bed002_1000	aa	Well . ; Like , Tango 's really close . ; Yeah , cuz a tango ; Yeah .
Bmr012_346	s	Yeah . ; um and what 's which ; So that 's very encouraging . ; this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,
Bmr019_670	s	and and W we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring ; and um , ; some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , ; which is a um , I think was both a a pruning problem
Bmr008_1389	b	Yeah . ; but ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bed008_669	b	see that se ; Yeah . ; cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_787	b	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , great . ; Yeah .
Bed005_123	s	It , uh I didn't measure it , ; but it was about an hour and ten minutes . ; Yep . ; Something like that .
Bmr005_267	x	It 's just that i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of of of slandering anybody , ; But , then it won't I mean , if we if we ; but ; It 's not a meeting .
Bmr006_551	b	So . ; Yeah . ; One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1399	aa	Another suggestion . ; Yeah . ; Rather than have circle fill in forms , say " Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . " ; OK .
Bed014_267	%	It doesn't The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph . ; And so on . ; Hmm . ; That
Bmr011_725	bk	I 'm pretty sure . ; I don't know . ; Well I 'll I 'll get another one before the end of the meeting . ; OK .
Bro005_1120	s	Yeah . ; Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb ; But ; I 'm I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . that
Bmr022_1254	ba	The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying ; and if the changes don't overlap each other , they can just do it . ; Hmm . ; That 's interesting .
Bmr015_845	b	and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point , ; but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_270	co	I don't know . ; I don't I 'm not sure but I remember @ @ that I can't show that . ; OK , but that 's a That is a a good check point , ; you should do that anyway ,
Bro019_1051	b	But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News . ; So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation ; and some of the focus conditions were noisy ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1159	fa	for unvoiced . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; I 'm sorry .
Bsr001_926	s	So it 's just got a d ; it 's a lot easier . ; Yes . ; I think there are some programs in TV .
Bed009_840	no	uh ; It That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way . ; uh ; but I dunno .
Bmr025_579	cc	Now ; But ; y yeah . ; Well I 'll turn off the screensaver too .
Bed002_806	bk	And ; Right then ? ; After the third task . ; OK .
Bed003_1215	%--	Mm - hmm . ; uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up . ; I think we ; I think a a sort of general strategy here
Bro011_560	b	What which test set was this ? ; This is ; that I looked at ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_82	bk	OK . So , what are we g else we got ? ; You got you just wrote a bunch of stuff . ; No . That was all , um , previously here . ; Oh .
Bdb001_1096	s	Uh , you know , anything you can envision . ; Yeah . ; So what I was imagining was um , so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons . ; And so put , uh , a a green ribbon on for an overlap code .
Bmr028_1750	b	Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power . ; we can afford we can a ; We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have energies diverted . ; Hmm .
Bmr013_527	b	Well , you know , I mean they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , ; so I mean I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_84	b	So the uh the people can go to code and say " well listen this is what you stole from me " ; Right . ; you know ? ; Right .
Bro003_1286	bk	a a Am I am I interpreting this correctly ? ; Is this sort of what what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ? ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bsr001_800	b	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And he has a very good system for that ; and and he wants to use this corpus . ; Yeah .
Bed004_404	s	go do it . ; Uh I I 'd No , I was gonna wait until ; Oh , OK . ; So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh Bayes - net ,
Bmr026_737	ar	Yeah . ; Ugh . ; So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting ; I don't .
Bmr003_2333	ba	Wow . ; Uh , let the record show at uh at f four thirty - five Adam Janin says ; Well w yeah , exactly . ; Tempting .
Bmr022_1058	%--	Does that solve anything ? ; Uh , n n not really , ; because then we have the coordination issue . ; I mean , so one thing they could do
Bmr031_801	%--	OK . ; Any other items ? ; So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff . ; Uh , transcrip
Btr001_1223	aa	T ; Right , ; yeah , ; oh , yeah yeah .
Bro021_1287	b	Uh , or is there some adaptation ? ; no , no , no . It 's not completely ; No , it 's I am doing something like an adaptation of the noise . ; OK .
Bro005_38	s	Uh . ; OK . ; Uh ; OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done
Buw001_773	%--	Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera . ; sp spatial organization ; And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . ; You know , I mean , this is
Bro003_2078	%--	Yeah . ; for the ; So if you choose sigmoid it 's o it 's OK ? ; You ,
Bro004_1372	s	You don't get the don't get the visuals ; but ; I is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down ? ; Uh , I think yes .
Bed004_631	s	too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially . ; Right . ; So we wanna think about which ones we really care about ; and what they really most depend on ,
Bed011_1022	s	yeah . ; Right . ; Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . ; I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from sort of as general as argument structure constructions .
Bmr013_824	s	OK . ; So they 're really running out of , data , prett I mean that 's good . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that first set .
Bmr014_909	s	You - you 've talked me into that , ; but I I just think that we should make it harder to do . ; The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . ; Whereas this web interface , I just get email ,
Btr001_2559	%--	Oh my God . ; Oh , no . ; They have this really nice ; You know , it 's really
Bed008_152	b	Great . ; There it is . ; Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1078	s	You 're never gonna be copying them around and making working copies of them . ; Right . ; And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues . ; That right now , lots of people create the files
Bmr018_1405	%--	so they ; um , ; You mean they have some . ; yeah , we should probably what would
Bro026_1043	s	uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of ; Mmm . ; and , um And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon ; So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that ,
Bro026_433	co	Right . ; Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . ; But I I w w ; My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it .
Bsr001_1723	b	Yeah . ; You get a little slightly different estimators ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1086	%--	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Even you have reported actually zero delay for the compression . ; I thought maybe you also have some different
Bed003_836	b	Mm - hmm . ; So Tom Cruise 's house is not a public building ; but it has a door . ; Right .
Bns001_657	s	You can even request it in GPS ; but it 's not end - to - end quality of service . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; It is only um what the gateways get .
Bed012_483	s	And then , so , the only reason way we would know what question he 's asking is based upon ; Oh , so if Let 's say I had a construction parser , and I plug this in , I would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction was ; Mm - hmm . ; and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately , in response .
Bmr025_1019	b	Anyway . ; Do we have anything else ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr015_1188	qw	you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well . ; The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart . ; OK , fair enough . ; I guess , um , I uh , what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem ?
Bmr009_970	no	Because is different , the Span - uh the Spanish language from the the north of Spain , of the south , of the west and the ; Sure . ; But . ; So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety .
Bro005_571	s	Yeah , you have to change the ; No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training ; And then you can vary it . ; Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances
Bmr021_26	b	Yeah right . ; I much prefer these . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1348	b	Yeah , that 's what I would be worried about too . ; Well , I think ; yeah , I think there are probably ways that you can say that , you know , only certain users are allowed to change things . ; Yeah .
Bed015_957	cc	Yeah , ; OK . ; and , infer and I don't have I don't have a great way or great examples ; I 'll - I 'll wait .
Bed005_435	bk	" Goodbye " , causes it to c to create basically an " Action Goodbye - End - Action " . ; Which is a means of telling the system to shut down . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed006_1414	s	Yeah . ; um that 's kind of a contentious point between the two of us ; but this is one wa so this is a way to link uh the way these roles are filled out to the action . ; In my view .
Bmr009_546	%--	Uh OK . ; So maybe uh since w we 're trying to uh compress the meeting , ; um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about ; and did you have some ?
Bns002_609	%--	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; It 's a assumption it 's it 's clear . ; But on the other hand , um , in a real world it isn't , or ?
Bro017_119	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And so , so now they want to say " we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . "
Bro018_166	b	Yeah . ; So I mean you 're you 're you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should we should get about this difference ; but uh in fact , you know maybe just feeding this in or or feeding both of them in ; Hmm .
Bed013_1058	s	it 's hard coded , ; like Srini , sort of hand parsed , ; hand crafted , ; but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances , and from ontologies ,
Bmr016_284	s	So I don't really know how it compares . ; Yeah . ; But it but ; But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus .
Btr002_776	aa	Yeah , I mean , it 's very useful in like all senses ; cuz ; Oh yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1554	s	So . ; And that 's w that 's where I added comments . ; Hmm . ; The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who
Bro011_609	s	what is the uh what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? ; And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix ; Mm - hmm . ; and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that
Bed015_1104	b	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's unclear whether ; I mean , you could just have in your scenario , " here are some extra few things that are true " , right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_12	ba	Uh , agenda items , number one , I wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues . ; What the heck are we gonna do about microphones ? ; So uh I got passed on that the EDU group doesn't like the uh , Crown mikes . ; Oh .
Bro022_416	s	Yeah . ; Two point seven . ; I know in the meeting , like ; On the meeting we have two point seven .
Bed005_293	s	I mean it 's sort of ; Yeah . Yep . OK . ; And " see this " is exactly the same thing . ; OK , so it is set - based .
Bro017_107	co	Right . ; And nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement . ; So they agreed that uh there will be a twenty - five percent improvement required on on uh h u m bad mis badly mismatched ; But wait a minute ,
Bmr013_196	b	OK , so , um , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . ; And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2905	b	You gotta be the one who you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's true . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_671	b	We would actually ; I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1928	bk	I 'll I 'll borrow the head back and and agree . ; Yeah , ; I wi I I will do that next week . ; Yeah ,
Bro014_1305	bk	But not here . ; But presumably you 'll see something that won't have this kind of , uh , uh , uh , regularity in frequency , uh , in the ; But ; Yeah . Well .
Bmr030_669	s	What will that do ? ; And so , uh ; Is that going to ? ; Give us a couple more wireless channels .
Bmr008_1771	b	Yeah . ; eh it 's ehm No , no , it 's unsigned . ; I think it 's ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1351	t3	I I think , ; yeah . ; of of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics . ; Erase that part .
Bed004_581	ba	Uh , " approach " , you called it , I think this time . ; uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in . ; That 's what you said ; Yeah , that 's fine .
Bro021_936	s	That doesn't follow . ; Well , if E restricts ; It is y ; Well , this is this is in the ti the time domain .
Bns002_1027	s	and these protocols are trying to work on demand , ; so they are trying to solve on only these routers that are needed ; so when I want to send uh , a packet to a a given destination , first of all , I have to figure out the proper route for this packet . ; And then , uh I 'm using soft routing .
Bmr006_1714	aap	Yeah . ; That 's that 's the issue . ; I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . ; Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse .
Bmr013_817	b	but the next , m m ; I was about to need to assign a new meeting ; and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , ; OK .
Bro026_945	aa	Yeah . ; And you 've been thinking about it more now , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_465	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , someone 's gonna have to downsample . ; But then they 're just they 're just there 's just deferring the problem to later
Bmr024_603	%	That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording . ; Um ; Nnn . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_1717	b	Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . ; Well . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro028_156	s	So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units , ; and the tandem network has five hundred . ; Um . ; So it 's smaller
Bsr001_738	%--	and , you know , some of it may go into something , depending on , you know , your scalable power . ; That 's right . ; So so the ; As I said , the Meeting Recorder project ,
Bro003_1161	d	Yeah . ; Really ? ; Well . ; Running on what ?
Bro019_602	b	But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , ; and we don't know where exactly ; but , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1589	b	right , ; and the PTA was in these , uh , topics about children , ; That 's not bad . ; Yeah .
Bed014_62	s	Oh , then it 's just gonna be the five of us ? ; Well , he he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four . ; Yeah . ; But you know , that was before he knew about that George lecture probably .
Bmr009_741	b	I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News . ; So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think . ; Great ! ; Good , good .
Bns001_524	aa	How 's it start ? ; I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz . ; Uh da it was another related project called Daedalus . ; Yes .
Bro012_1103	b	I mean if it ; the compared to the small or the big network . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1618	b	And , um , ; w one thing that the , um , LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that I I might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . ; Um , Stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order IIR filter . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1004	ba	Oh ! ; Yeah , ; Och ! ; good point .
Bmr019_1850	ba	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Is , eh , a another acoustic event . ; Nice .
Bmr010_713	b	Mm - hmm . ; So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1769	g	Right . ; Right . ; but it 's still a laugh . ; you know ?
Bro010_1206	bk	um ; not in the time domain ; but in the uh the stream of features uh I guess . ; Yeah ,
Bmr023_599	b	Yeah . ; that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_332	aa	But . ; But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_190	s	It 's just easier to read . ; The spaces already bias it toward being separated . ; Right . ; And I know I 'm gonna find this easier than words .
Bmr019_762	b	and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between ; you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . ; So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues . ; Right .
Bmr026_930	%--	Yeah . ; And that that that will probably help , actually , ; So it 's a little different ? ; because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um , um
Bro017_169	s	Uh it may be that that ; Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .
Bro012_49	%--	and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe ; filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , ; even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , ; but it 's
Bmr014_752	s	Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ? ; Yes . ; I also ; If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that .
Bro018_1109	bk	And on meeting rec recorder far mike digits , mike on channel F , it went from um forty - one percent error to eight percent error . ; On on the real data , not with artificial reverb ? ; Right . ; Uh - huh .
Bro022_66	aa	Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . ; Oh . ; Soon . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_510	t1	uh , filled pauses ; So disfluen the D 's are for , um , the interruption points of a disfluency , ; so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there . ; Uh , what else do we had .
Bmr011_127	b	Is ; The good way . ; So you want to ; Yeah .
Bmr019_831	%--	and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I didn't do it word level , ; but but in terms
Bro023_776	b	Mm - hmm . ; so we c ; so I mean , which which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the VAD ; Yes .
Bed013_1421	s	Mmm . ; Also we 're getting a a person who just got fired uh , from her job . ; Uh a person from Oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once Fey leaves in August . ; And um , she 's gonna look at it today .
Bmr026_996	%--	Right . ; Roughly ? ; Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error . ; And uh it was
Bed013_1201	s	and this makes something also something here true , ; and this makes this True - up , and this makes this True - up as well . ; I kinda like it better without that extra level of indirection too . ; You know with with this points to this points to that , and so on
Bmr003_2655	s	or or or or or a little , uh you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist . ; I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time . ; Mmm ! ; Or both .
Bro025_715	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , I 'm I 'm , um , taking a look at some of , um , Sangita 's work on on TRAPS . ; She did something where , um w where the TRAPS learn ; She clustered the the temporal patterns of , um , certain certain phonemes in in m averaged over many , many contexts .
Bed003_1393	%--	but um um we can sort of ; It has a very clear interface . ; We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn ; and and the turn before that or you know
Bed002_99	bk	Um , but uh , ; um , it w uh , ; I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . ; OK .
Bro023_615	bk	if you have two channels . ; Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the noisy signal . ; And then you try to minimize the error between these two . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1660	co	The th the ; It 's network services and applications . ; They are hard to understand . ; Wait .
Bmr015_640	b	As you might expect , ; Mm - hmm . ; because when it 's ; Sure .
Bmr031_583	2	And then shortened . ; you know , it 's if you use D V Ds or something , that 's ; Yeah . ; A lot .
Bmr008_1798	bk	Oh , digits . ; and and uh ; OK . ; OK .
Btr002_1223	s	It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it , ; and then it grew really big . ; So like " four " and " five " and " three " all had this same characteristic , ; and " six " and " seven " o both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings .
Bro021_1211	t1	v ; What 's that variable ? ; Uh , this is the ; Weak .
Bed015_349	s	I mean , we we we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh with , a p ; Uh , we don't mind either , ; so ; I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of of phrase structure .
Bmr009_1029	bk	So . ; but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because um I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard . ; This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions ; Oh . OK .
Bns001_998	s	But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all . ; It 's l just a thirty - bit number ; Mm - hmm . ; that a actually is an assigned number .
Bed008_1023	b	If you needed it to do that . ; Yeah . ; But uh OK I was just thinking ; Yeah .
Bro022_11	s	Yeah . ; Uh , uh , we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point ; and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done . ; It was very very believable schedules , too .
Bed002_1017	s	Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them , ; Mm - hmm . ; and see ho how it worked , ; and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .
Bmr024_1334	b	We can ; Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check , ; because we save all the intermediate models ; Yeah .
Bro012_1090	b	Mm - hmm . ; I mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1146	s	I mean , uh , we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in ; and and and , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; we kept the number of parameters the same and so forth ,
Bed003_809	s	" Is it Can it be entered ? " ; then of course , this is sort of binary as well . ; Yeah . ; And then um , there 's also the question whether it may be entered .
Bed004_864	b	so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , ; that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately . ; Should be decoupled , yeah . ; OK .
Btr002_1556	s	That 's kind of interesting , though . ; Yeah . ; Well , we 're coming kind of close to the end of our time here . ; Um , I did ask about dessert
Bro013_603	s	Mm - hmm . ; and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . ; Yeah . ; It 's around one hundred , one hundred and fifty hertz Nnn .
Bns001_1276	s	But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success , ; impossible to change . ; You see the difficulties with IP version six , ; eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast .
Bmr016_1160	s	so that it 's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one , ; and a couple of others , ; not many . ; So " wanna " is another one ,
Bmr029_977	b	And it saves it in a ; and then ts get gives out a a waveform , ; and I I want to manipulate the the waveform , then . ; I see .
Bmr008_1502	s	Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ? ; That 's what I just wondered .
Bed008_259	s	cross ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Climb , rob .
Bro008_247	s	So , ; um , uh , that 's one one aspect of it . ; And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering Uh , ; I mean , the VAD stuff they both had ,
Bsr001_2169	%--	Yeah . ; I mean , both I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this . ; No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts for Mari . ; And if Mari 's too busy then
Buw001_173	%	PDA - right , ; PDA - left . ; OK . ; Thanks .
Btr002_2232	b	and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens ; and the inbreath and stuff ; and it and how extremely audible and and visual , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_965	%--	Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ? ; The cross pads ? ; Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads . ; Cuz I was thinking you know if if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know
Bns002_855	s	so , eh , you know , everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted by the receiver . ; So ; in fact , eh nnn some people proposing this mechanism is is showing a a b a big improvement ; and eh there are a lot of other mechanisms , also regarding and a time - out mechanism , or the time - out algorithm for these retries when you try to send something and you don't succeed , uh , what what you the amount of time you have to wait until you retry again .
Bro017_307	bs	They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So there 's a very high correlation .
Bmr019_103	s	Well , it 's Yeah , sort of the bre the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that , the lapel 's gonna be better on . ; Or the cross - talk . ; Yeah . ; The lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling ,
Bmr023_244	s	So , um Yeah . We just used those . ; And do you splice them into the waveform ? ; Or ? ; Yeah . He then he d I recorded Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked .
Bro003_938	aa	Oh , there 's a there 's Spanish testing in the Aurora ? ; Uh , not yet , ; but , uh , yeah , uh , e ; Yeah ,
Bro004_87	bk	He 's facing this way . ; What ? ; OK , this this would be a good section for our silence detection . ; OK .
Bro015_24	b	July or August , or . ; Yeah , I mean it may not happen . ; I mean he wants uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's he 's uh thinking of going someplace , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_189	s	Well . The other system are for instance . ; For Italian is at seventy - eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch , ; and this new system has eighty - nine . ; But I don't think it indicates something , really .
Bro021_1295	bk	um ; I estimate mean and variance for each one of the Gaussian of the codebook . ; No , I 'm talking about the noise . ; Oh ,
Bro004_764	s	Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is ; you 're ignoring ; you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , ; you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context .
Bmr027_206	ba	Mm - hmm . ; So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record . ; We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . ; Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .
Bed004_320	s	And then I um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot , ; um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then the bottom layer is just the Mode .
Bmr013_242	s	Yeah . ; Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , I mean , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , uh , you know , uh , tense lax . ; Mm - hmm . ; Some things are really difficult .
Bro025_16	ba	Oh , good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Excellent .
Bed005_1260	s	and we 'll write it down in a flat file . ; No . ; So , i is ; Well , let me say something , guys ,
Bro003_614	s	i It 's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like like , say thirty - nine , phone symbols , ; So . ; right ? ; Uh , and then they get the variety by by bringing in the context , the phonetic context .
Bro003_1614	s	so so you ; yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network . ; Right , ; so es so especially if you 're right , if you 're if you 're taking some piece of the training corpus , which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the on the , uh , file server , uh , then , yeah , it 's fine if it 's not backed up
Bed003_572	bk	Yeah . ; Go ahead . ; and then try to find the probability of other nodes . ; OK .
Bed016_145	s	Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it , ; OK . ; but . I already read half of it , ; Um , I don't I , uh I don't need it .
Bns002_391	s	So , maybe my idea first . ; So this is what , node one ? ; This is node two ; and this is the source ,
Bmr023_699	s	So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , ; but was sort of trying to , uh , get a general idea
Bmr007_341	s	That 's really neat . ; Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of ; Yeah . ; This is really interesting data .
Bmr021_44	s	So the question is , the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more , um , Sony mikes . ; Just two more of those , ; um . And that that 's easy ; and that will certainly work .
Bmr012_137	s	Anyway . ; I still don't see the problem . ; Either way ; yeah I think I think age is alright
Bed004_429	%--	and ; there 're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness . ; Mmm . ; Uh , so . If you co you could ima and I
Bmr010_966	bk	Uh ; Yeah . Why don why don't we just since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , uh , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions ; and ? ; OK .
Bns002_592	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; We are assuming all the nodes are exactly the same .
Bro012_217	b	This really happens . ; I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_163	qw	Mm - hmm . ; So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , how do I do it with " run command " ?
Bmr012_1282	aa	and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you know could tell us about it . ; Yeah . ; Give us a status . ; Yeah .
Bns003_296	%--	You are definitely right . ; It was in a good shape , but it , uh , then we disturbed . ; OK , ; And then maybe the the ICSI logo could be could be could be ,
Btr001_1854	b	Um , ; I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . ; And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are ; Yeah .
Bro003_1340	b	It 's it 's , uh instead of doing RASTA with a log , you 're doing RASTA with a log - like function that varies depending on a J parameter , ; uh , which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is . ; So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is . ; Hm - hmm .
Bed015_1078	s	the thing is that that I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . ; It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been , ; Yeah . ; or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active .
Bro019_879	s	the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad . ; It 's ; I see . ; it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .
Bed008_398	co	OK . ; given that he knows it , of course . ; Alright . ; So let me suggest this .
Bed016_226	s	they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? ; Uh , ; which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , ; or in the Bavaria example ,
Bro004_763	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is ; you 're ignoring ; you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features ,
Bmr006_453	b	Yeah . ; I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro014_360	s	I I guess what I 'm ; I mean , I I was thinking about it in terms of , if I were building the final product ; and I was gonna test to see which front - end I 'd I wanted to use , ; I would try to weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in .
Btr001_1399	no	So they can't get clues from the other channels ? ; Well , you know , the The way they 're listening to it is they they get a they get ; Or can they ? ; I don't know .
Bro005_703	s	um , ; the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . ; but when the M - MLP is trained on the um is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . ; Except if the features are bad
Bmr029_515	s	And ; It 's not just speaker adaptation . ; It 's the whole norm feature normalization process . ; I it 's spea uh , all that is speaker - based .
Bmr014_718	s	I mean unless you 're searching . ; Searching , of course , should be electronic , ; but if you 're not ; so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,
Bmr025_200	s	because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's um , ; I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . ; Mm - hmm . ; So getting them to compile on Windows might be challenging .
Bns002_148	s	Well , ; You know , it 's an interesting question . ; Uh , the the main thing about an ad - hoc network is not that nodes move . ; It is the way of topology changes can happen .
Bro024_1166	s	Yeah . ; One curve 's for the close - talking microphone , which is the lower curve . ; Ah , OK . ; And the other one is for the distant microphone
Bro021_153	aa	but but , um , ; just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough . ; It may be that they 're making them better in some ways and worse in others , ; Yeah .
Bmr006_679	s	Because you have the the the distribution , now . ; But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . ; I 've seen it already . ; It 's a real problem , a frequently problem uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time .
Bro019_327	h	Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's what 's up with you ? ; Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1315	%--	And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side . ; But you 're d ; Right . ; It might be that one more iteration would would help , but it 's sort of
Btr001_2527	s	He 's very funny . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; I I started laughing with something he said the other day ,
Bmr006_827	qw	OK . ; " Why ? ; Why ? ; What 's the reason ? "
Bmr012_834	no	There 's there 's your answer . ; But but it wouldn't hurt to try , ; Could easily try ; That 's what I would assume but you never know ,
Bmr006_193	s	Uh , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . ; If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , uh , language model , ; Uh - huh . ; this is the worst case scenario .
Buw001_1171	aa	m i Even if that much ? ; Uh , less . ; Less . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_695	s	The demo ? ; Something about ; The demo was one of them . ; Demo and IBM , I think .
Bmr022_1375	s	even if they were listening to it . ; So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong , ; Yeah . ; sometimes it 's multiple interpretations ,
Bed003_123	b	their being nice w ; feature . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro004_794	%--	It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that uh the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , sure ; but
Btr001_453	b	isn't it Catalan ? ; Catalan . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_104	s	or training material , ; or what ? ; Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , ; so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours
Bmr001_38	s	Mm - hmm . ; Hang on , let 's let 's OK let 's just let 's just name the microphones . ; OK . ; So I 'm speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing .
Buw001_1195	s	but ; Yeah . ; Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " , ; um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything .
Bmr020_1043	%--	and this includes things like going from one sentence into the u one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next , ; um , ; w without really stopping . ; I mean i they , i
Bmr016_2155	s	And he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . ; He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data ; Yeah . ; and found segments that would be useful .
Bro004_1331	co	That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN ; Tonic . ; uh But it won't be installed for a little while . ; U Go ahead .
Btr001_987	qw	And it 's so time - consuming . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that , ; and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ?
Bmr027_1018	s	and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , ; and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to . ; So , ; um . And now the first one .
Bro003_476	x	I see . ; Right . ; I I I get in the picture about the cube . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_327	s	And then others were connected digits . ; Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think . ; OK . ; The I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using .
Bmr007_906	s	Um another another research thing , different groups , eh working , eh on Broadcast News prefer to , eh to consider hypothesis eh between each phoneme . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , when a phone changes . ; Because , I I I think it 's more realistic that , uh only consider the the the the silence between the speaker .
Bmr020_332	%--	you still have significant overlap . ; You know , it goes down from maybe For Switchboard it goes down from I don't know f um I don't know f fourteen percent of the words to maybe uh I don't know , eleven percent or something ; it 's it 's not a dramatic change , ; so it 's
Bro012_855	b	So if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the ; So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance . ; Oh , OK . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_790	bk	I d ; I don't know . ; Well , it 's both both uh , cases can i ; Oh .
Bmr006_834	b	We 're just ; We just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_424	b	Right . ; However , not only was the common census were among all participants of Friday 's meeting was it 's gonna be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things , ; all the different actions , if at all possible , ; Right .
Bmr016_2191	s	Two two or more . ; And that the master is gonna be the channelized version . ; Right . ; So right now we 've taken this i initial one , it was a single channel basically the way it was input .
Bmr013_331	b	So I think it would be be best to have all of it if we could . ; But um , ; But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1555	s	There 's There 's more amount speech ; uh , more amount of ; Yeah well , the detector says there is speech , ; but there is none .
Bed009_325	b	what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1530	%--	it , ; uh ; Well , ; to
Bed008_128	b	but I think I 'm following it . ; So far . ; So here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2422	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh - huh . ; it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_1042	s	So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . ; OK . ; So . ; And then it we have to go to the planning session for that workshop .
Bmr015_864	%--	Uh , uh , ; you 're looking at f at the phase derivative , ; um , ; in in , uh ,
Bmr011_774	ba	So , you know , that means ; you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on ; Uh , right now all eight of them have differe uh , uh , additional data sets . That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month . ; Hope so .
Bed014_213	b	Hmm ! ; Very long . ; Hmm ! ; Hmm .
Bed016_211	bk	OK . ; That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr016_1622	bk	Yeah . ; But , I I 'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless I actually listen to them . ; Seems so . ; OK .
Buw001_108	s	La - Landay ? ; Landay . James . ; So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk note - taking things , ; then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit .
Bmr022_1287	s	So that , when you 're developing it and it 's really rough , you don't put it in the repository . ; Yeah . ; You wait to the point when you 're ready to release it , ; and then you put it in the repository
Bed014_1310	s	So it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to communicate this story ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , internally , we should just do whatever works ,
Bed008_1485	s	well you have a ; can you bring up the function thing ? ; Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of ; That 's on the added variable ,
Bed010_68	bk	So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you . ; OK . N , ; N , V ; yeah ,
Bro018_964	no	and um ; Right . ; But I I think in ; I don't know .
Bro019_1414	s	So , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is , ; it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced ,
Bmr016_2008	qw	Good . ; Great . ; Yep . ; Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the " NUMS " on it ?
Bed003_231	s	like " I 'm " the the abstract idea being " I am a tourist ; I want to go to this place . " ; Right ? ; So we 're gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go
Bro012_86	s	but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do . ; So , I mean , it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise ,
Bmr019_986	s	Mm - hmm . ; and embedde embedded in overlaps . ; The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal , ; which , you know , I mean , you c not not too surprising .
Bmr027_652	s	rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , ; and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late . ; Yeah . I was ; I was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this .
Bed017_462	s	And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be ; now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . ; So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . ; And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach ,
Bmr020_947	s	That 'll only be if it 's the background speaker . ; Right . ; So you 'll you 'll have a chunk of , you know , channel A which starts at zero and ends at ten , ; and then the same channel starting at eleven ,
Bed006_151	s	But ; Yeah . ; uh ; So it was really Carol Snow who was confused , not me and not Jerry .
Bmr009_496	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; So it 's So , uh if you i i So i if there if there close to things it does ; Yeah .
Btr002_1169	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Excellent . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_112	g	And then , uh and then these also have I Ds . ; Right ? ; So you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like , um , oh , I don't know , uh , " noise - type equals door - slam " . ; You know ?
Bmr016_1403	aa	Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; You say arg - C and arg - V all the time . ; That 's right .
Bed013_541	s	What what do we actually ; Because I mean , it I don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do . ; I mean , it 's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation , ; and have no you know , we can't write an ACL type paper where we say , " OK , we 've done this
Bro028_992	s	Y yeah . ; Gets thrown out . ; Yeah . ; so we 'll throw it out
Bed014_841	b	Right . ; That metaphor is not going anywhere , you know . ; So ; Yeah .
Btr001_1572	s	Yeah . ; But , um , ; yeah , I did I did like actually doing the transcribing a little bit more . ; You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing ,
Bmr016_1072	bk	Right . ; It 's good to think towards scratch . ; Yeah , so these wouldn't be backed up , the ; Yeah .
Bmr006_549	b	And so one That that will be done , like , in about two hours . ; And so uh , at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_212	%--	Yep . ; Couple times . ; a couple times , ; so , um , yeah , the transcribers notice
Bns001_1168	s	So , multicast . This means that there are many things done . ; Oh , what was it ? ; Maybe I was routing mobility management ; But no one actually put them together .
Bro019_1006	%--	Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , ; and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then ,
Bro027_1567	s	with , like , less latency using SNR and energy , um , after the cleaning up . ; So what I 'd been trying was , um , ; uh ; After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean .
Bmr011_1220	s	I mean , I would think that that , uh , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . ; Which one . ; Mmm . ; I think vowels vowels are I think harder .
Bmr005_31	s	Umh . ; Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information . ; And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that , ; but uh I think that would be a good thing to add .
Bro013_447	b	but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT , ; Mm - hmm . ; and is not ready yet to use on , ; Yeah .
Bns001_264	s	But , anyway , if we come to a certain kind of uh , common work within the core of the NSA group , I think that 's really beneficial to everybody . ; And uh , especially , Wilbert , if you have in mind to go in the mmm , uh , really from the project proposal view , I think we can build it on this this core . ; You know , ; and go to the outer world with , and and and align it in a certain way .
Bed003_68	s	Of course . ; Mm - hmm . ; and then if I do that it 'll mess everything up . ; I was wondering .
Bns001_1534	s	because the road map for the the next generation networks is is eh is for many years . ; And b before UMTS will be deployed very well , I believe eh it will be common t uh two thousand four or something like that . ; So . ; And and have an intermediate project , which is related in this direction , something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever .
Bmr008_547	s	Yeah . ; So that 's ; That 's right . ; Well that you know that was the concept of having the region thing ,
Bmr008_1442	qw	so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway . ; Right . ; Right . ; What about doing it with just the single channels ?
Bdb001_937	h	but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the ; Oh , maybe ; Yeah ? ; um
Bmr016_68	s	So I can't imagine why anyone would care . ; So the other topic with digits is uh , ; Liz would like to elicit different prosodics , ; and so we tried last week with them written out in English .
Btr001_2112	qw	I 'm wondering , ; um , ; so we still technically ; uh you know I mean , what should we do in terms of tea ?
Bro022_420	aa	Right . ; Oh . ; That 's with the new IIR filters ? ; Uh . Yeah , yeah .
Bro017_74	s	I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; But And French Telecom was saying " no , no , no ,
Bro012_832	qw	What 's the rationale ? ; We ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Why why do it ?
Bro021_1246	s	Now . ; And this is fixed . ; Mm - hmm . ; If I never do an estimat a newer estimation of the noise , this mean as mean and the variance are fixed .
Bmr007_319	b	Ah but , yeah . ; And then it would be harder ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_803	s	But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what he wants me to do ; and what we what we will do and uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting
Bmr011_1702	s	I had as my fourth thing here processing of wave forms . ; Yeah . ; What did we mean by that ? ; Uh , Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing .
Bmr009_644	aa	You you want it around the overlapping part . ; You want it to include something that 's not in overlapping ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1066	s	uh , sum the differences ? ; OK . ; So . ; And I think the variance is computed only from , like , two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred .
Bmr028_710	s	Yea ; OK . ; But , uh , I think the per the people it disrupts the most are the transcribers . ; Well , you know , uh , I All I need to do is mail , um send them m a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time .
Bmr011_1209	s	You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , ; there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth . ; Um , as opposed to doing phonetic uh , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , ; and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those those things .
Bsr001_806	b	Exactly . ; So . ; I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1090	bk	yeah . ; Just order it . ; It 's a lot of money for a handband . ; OK
Bmr012_1215	b	and and uh ; Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other ; Pretty soon . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr003_1440	s	So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this could be something that was handled by a table or something ; but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever .
Btr001_1297	b	I think it was a little bit faster than just transcribing it , ; Wow , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_180	%--	Oh . OK . ; I mean , we didn't mention Morgan by name ; and he talks a lot . ; we just
Bmr015_1164	%--	u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . ; Mm - hmm . ; See , in a in a way this is a really key point , ; that for speech recognition , uh , research ,
Bed015_2179	qw	In the process thereof , or whatever . ; OK . ; So , what 's what when are we gonna meet again ? ; When are you leaving ?
Bmr016_1792	s	Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah so th th there there 's a few cases like that where the um , the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language , ; but there 's not very many of these .
Bmr024_1289	aap	Well , what 's the standard ? ; Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males . ; That 's what I thought , too . ; Um , that ye overall , yes ,
Bmr023_1240	bk	I I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together . ; I don't know . ; Should we just ? ; OK .
Bro014_472	s	Same microphone ; but ; Yeah . ; but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions .
Bmr016_795	b	So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan , ; So ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_395	d	Right . ; So , why not ? ; Sure . ; That was it ?
Buw001_1448	b	Uh , you might want to mention something that that you brought up . ; " Thing that was discussed . " ; And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1156	s	Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . ; But we have s f for this kind of task , I would think , sort of a modest amount . ; I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . ; We have a modest amount of of uh training data from a couple different conditions ,
Bro024_1106	co	It 's ; Yeah , ; we have to take ; Wait a minute .
Bro014_1571	s	Yeah . ; Um . ; Sure . ; I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman .
Bed014_907	b	yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah , I thought it was just this week that we were changing it . ; Mmm . Yeah .
Bmr031_1383	s	There 's some work , um , that ; Do you remember this paper or poster by , um , some CMU folks at , uh , HLT ? ; They were talking about ; and and they s they referred to an upcoming ICASSP paper , I think , at the time .
Buw001_1284	%	Yeah . ; But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_147	b	I keep on hoping that they 're gonna get done but they don't . ; Well , I I can help them get done um one question is budget . ; I ; Yeah !
Bmr018_144	aa	Will we have time to , um , to prepare something that we in the format we were planning for the IBM transcribers by then , ; or ? ; Oh yeah . ; Absolutely .
Bed002_91	b	Oh , I see , ; but the a but the but the ; Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? " , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the " Jerry "s . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1253	s	So , this is a project that um has time - aligned spoken data ; which is um I see it as sort of in - between um these fields ; because a lot of the time when people do rich um intonational and and stress - oriented transcription they don't have the digital record at the same time ; and the don't have it time - aligned .
Btr001_2053	ba	What would be the point of that ? ; Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback . ; Oh . ; Oh , wow .
Bro018_774	b	and then later on , once you have these phonological features , then uh map that to phones . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm I 'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff . ; Mmm .
Btr002_186	s	Mm - hmm . ; Because it really seems like it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; And then often , you know , i it 's , um , i there 's ex the parentheses are used ,
Bro004_251	s	That 's interesting . That 's interesting . ; Do you see ? Because Uh , ; Uh . ; so No , that that 's important .
Bmr018_609	aa	Oh was it fifteen ? ; This is error you 're talking about ? ; whe ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2120	s	Yeah , every word has only one , yeah e one version ; even if even if it 's ; A actually even like the word " read " and " read " ; Those are two different words .
Bed016_476	bk	Yeah . ; Uh , as a model . ; They are w now building it ? ; Hmm .
Bmr005_236	qrr	Do Sh - Can I say ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; or or is that just too sensitive ?
Bed003_841	%--	But the thing is ; OK , sh ; explain to me why it 's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public . ; Or , if something
Bmr030_342	s	Yeah . OK . ; OK . ; I I gave you a c couple examples , ; Yeah , I m didn't have time to to look at that ,
Bmr010_796	s	Mm - hmm . ; Anyway . ; I could say something about about the ; Well , I don't know what you wanna do . Yeah .
Bmr024_715	%--	So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ? ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; You can you can
Bed002_90	qw	Since it it does isn't attributed . ; Oh , I see , ; but the a but the but the ; Right , so if I said , " Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? " , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the " Jerry "s .
Bed002_178	s	And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . ; So , the most important form is the consent form , ; so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . ; I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,
Bmr028_372	s	I put that in just for you . ; Terrific . ; Well , since you didn't answer the emai ; So there was a q question I had asked Adam whether it 's possible to search only for your own name your own utterances ,
Bmr016_1239	ba	And ; Because ; Yes . And that 's why there 're different tags on the glosses , ; OK . So , then it 's fine .
Bed002_567	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there .
Bmr008_975	aa	Yeah , that 's a good one . ; Yeah . ; That 'd be OK . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1785	s	But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that , ; and you worked on for few months , as I recall , ; and you got to , say ninety - three percent , ; and getting to ninety - four really really hard .
Bro017_1026	bk	Well , you know , that 's ; We 've got five processors on that . ; that 's yeah , that 's a good thing ; Oh yeah .
Bsr001_2191	b	so we have no problem with that . ; I mean , there is no LDC database . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_153	b	The the the point is that we will use it , as it is uh described several times , that we will use it as a local network , in principle , ; but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of uh , media transportation f to put some stuff you need from your PC or your LS to this , uh uh , uh , to this testbed , ; you know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1290	s	I ; That was what I was wondering . ; Uh , yeah , time is the ; Time is unique .
Bmr009_1079	b	Yeah . ; I agree . I agree . ; I really am . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1485	%--	Oh . ; and then you got the cha the different channels come out . ; So right at the right and left of that ; So r right in here you have this bar that you move and as y as you go along it
Bro017_1083	s	Yeah . ; and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above , ; and so that was the only work which they had . ; They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there ,
Bed009_1033	s	OK . ; You could do this . ; But uh from our point of view this is also a research project ; and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,
Bmr001_791	s	Mm - hmm . ; Wow . ; Yeah . ; And uh we 'll see which one of those seems closest to right
Bed006_757	s	Eee . ; Yeah I I um have I have no ; Robert likes to be abstract ; and that 's what I just thought he was doing .
Bns003_394	s	I I just I ; people ; normally that 's was my my , uh ; In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example
Bro010_338	b	but I imagine you could , um , uh , predict a , uh um , a label , uh , from more in the past than in than than in the future . ; I mean , we 've d we 've done some stuff with that before . ; I think it it works OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_395	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; Then ; that would be whatever building they referred to .
Bed003_1641	bk	Sorry . ; I was just reading the screen . ; OK . ; Oh .
Bro016_37	s	it was sort of an obvious thing ; is , um , adjusting the , uh , sca the scaling and , uh , insertion penalty sorta stuff . ; I did play with that , actually , a little bit . ; Um . What happens is , uh , when you get to the noisy stuff , you start getting lots of insertions .
Buw001_2297	bk	Quiet sobbing . ; So I think we 're done . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro005_1280	s	uh , we say , " OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . ; So now uh um what 's your newest version ? " ; And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better ; and then we we 'd combine it .
Bed006_123	s	Didn't take a vote ? ; OK . ; OK , um , why don't we get started on that subject anyways . ; Um , so we 're about to collect data
Bro027_372	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; i that was a particular version . ; SUSI
Bro023_708	bk	Y Yeah , ; we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques ; Ah , ; I see .
Bro026_63	s	Good idea . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Actually I I tried wh while when I installed the repository , I tried from Belgium .
Btr001_2493	s	and they started off kind of shaky , ; Oh , right . ; they were like , " Oh , do we wanna do this at the same time , ; you know , that 's @ @ you know , wh let 's not all start laughing "
Bmr009_60	b	Um And uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain , may not be the right thing to do . ; Hi . ; Hi Jane ! ; Yeah .
Bmr016_30	s	I 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth . ; We have about two hours worth . ; I extracted out about an hour 's worth ; which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms ,
Bmr013_663	%	uh , because of the normalization , yeah . ; OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bed008_584	bk	Yeah . ; I think you have to be in move mode before ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bed002_589	b	Mm - hmm . ; which you have as DH , ; I don't know what the H means . ; Nuh .
Bmr003_1525	aa	so so he was checking the meter levels ; and and we were handling things while he was labeling the the whatever it was , ; the PDA ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2001	bk	You mean when you leave here ? ; When you 're somewhere else ? ; No , no . While I while I 'm working here , ; No , no . OK .
Bmr025_546	s	Yeah . ; Yeah that 's cuz you kn ; I 'm not doing anything . ; I I know why .
Bed004_781	s	Maybe we sho ; should we a add then the " what 's this ? " domain ? ; N ; I mean , we have to
Bmr024_1268	s	Yeah . ; And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test , ; and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test , ; and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results .
Bed006_1203	s	um ; because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something . ; Um now you define uh another action , ; Forced action or forced motion .
Bmr013_1024	aa	Excuse me ? ; Right . ; I said " For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown " . ; That 's right .
Bed005_318	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; be nice . ; No , no .
Bed002_525	s	because um , sometimes people just say things ; This you find very often . ; " Where is the city hall ? " ; And this do they don't wanna sh see it on a map ,
Btr002_1148	aa	Yeah . ; Right . ; OK . So now , ha ha who would 've ; Yes .
Bmr018_1134	s	Or some or some ; but ; I mean , I would see Eurospeech if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions . ; These will be things that are particular things ,
Bed002_1197	x	Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; But um , maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked ,
Bmr019_506	s	In the H L T paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned , ; which is now h being changed in the transcription process , ; which is good , ; and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,
Bmr016_124	s	because the digits are easier to recognize . ; They 're better trained than the numbers . ; Right . ; So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " .
Bed016_1143	bk	Right ? ; Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , ; that 's sort of one level higher . ; Oh , you want a lexical example .
Bmr016_849	b	Alright , I did know that . ; Um , so the the only question is how much of it ; The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_515	s	Nein ! ; You scream it . ; Nein ! ; Oh . In German ,
Bmr003_1519	d	So you take a bathroom break in the middle and and keep your head mount ; You have to turn off your mike . ; Yeah . ; Oh , you do ?
Buw001_2079	bk	Is that is that going to be publicly available , ; As far as I know , they h have not . ; or ? ; OK .
Bed006_1375	no	Well uh it 's it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on , and would be interesting . ; Yeah . ; um nevertheless um ; Mayb - Well maybe I 'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to .
Bdb001_677	bk	Well , I think I 'm I think w I had better look at it again ; s let 's let 's ta so let 's ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed002_131	s	and there are lots of different aspects of the project . ; Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . ; This is a mock - up of one . ; Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood .
Bed012_304	s	In terms of , these would be wha how we would answer the question Where - Is , ; right ? ; We u ; This is i That 's what you s it seemed like , explained it to me earlier
Bmr026_464	s	We need another gigaquad . ; Yep . ; At least . ; There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button .
Bmr027_1504	qw	Um , ; but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , ; which should be an interesting ; When 's it due ?
Bmr021_1020	aa	Right . ; Um . ; So maybe it 's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal . ; Yep .
Bsr001_1685	%--	of course . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; But , uh , just mixing the
Bsr001_777	s	So , Adam has a you know , a particular agenda , ; um , but obviously there are lots of other things . ; Mm - hmm . ; And you know , it 's the way that a project like this works
Bed003_503	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Uh - huh .
Bro005_418	b	Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other ; Which number ? ; cuz this is , uh with multi - English , uh , training . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1185	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; But it 's O K . ; You start off with that and the statistical system
Bmr014_770	%--	I think it is . ; I mean , because if I object to the conversation . ; If I say " we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , " and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side . ; The
Bns001_217	s	OK . ; Um . ; From my point of view , As I mentioned before , we still in the starting position . ; I think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on on f current um , available wireless networks and , uh , also for future generations .
Bed014_780	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz this is clearly part of th ; Yeah , we 've we 've done quite a bit of that .
Btr002_1603	b	I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time . ; When people get really loopy , ; and start telling lots of jokes , I think . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2240	co	So . ; Um , ; so I 'm gonna pass for the moment ; but y come come back to me .
Bmr026_523	b	And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . ; And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " ; So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " . ; Yeah .
Bed014_859	%	Really ? ; But , yeah , a second that would be great . ; So , uh , a sec I mean you 're gonna need it anyway . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_1190	bs	and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad . ; Oh , excellent . ; OK . ; So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot .
Bro008_433	s	Uh , you y I think in some case you got some little improvement , ; but it was , you know , sort of a small improvement , ; and it was a a big added complication , so you dropped it . ; But , um , that was just sort of one try ,
Bro018_501	ba	Mm - hmm . ; but but ; uh it 's uh ; It 's probably a good place to start .
Bmr019_1341	s	Right . ; Well ; That 's true . ; That 's another issue ,
Btr002_1961	ba	and he still had his microphone on , ; and then you could hear the the the r the women behind the desk talking to him , ; and just sort of stuff like that . ; It was just really bizarre .
Bed014_579	qw	But Keith suggested that a a much cleaner way would be is , you know , to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you if you know that something like that ha has been mentioned before , this just a continues to add up , ; you know , in th in a ; So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . ; And then when someone asks " where is X ? " you 've already got the the Enter schema activated
Bed003_110	s	And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls . ; The context , which in this case we 've limited to " business person " , " tourist " , or " unknown " , ; the time of day , ; and " open to suggestions " , isn't actually a feature .
Bro018_437	b	Uh . ; And then there 's these other meetings , like HLT and and uh ASRU ; so there 's there 's actually plenty of meetings that are really relevant to to uh computational uh speech processing of one sort or another . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_825	bk	Um . Yeah . U um ; Some ; Or if uh , you know , in the future , if Linux machines become like way cheaper , than , uh , you know , Solaris machines , then you know , that wouldn't be a reason not to use Linux anymore . ; Yep .
Bro012_461	bk	I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever ; Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different ; but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall . ; OK .
Bed008_818	no	s ; Mm - hmm . ; and so ; I I don't yet know how to do this ,
Bro005_427	s	So ; Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net ; Yeah . ; and straight features with delta - delta .
Bmr001_671	aa	Jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group , some of the AI meetings do it as well . ; And we should have like we should have Decoder meetings and stuff . ; And uh ; Exactly exactly .
Bmr002_393	bk	OK . ; I mean , given that we 've already got them digitally it would be ; you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing . ; Oh , OK .
Bdb001_852	s	And so that might be ; I mean , it 'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily , um , input that to some database if other people are using it . ; Yep . ; Something like that .
Bro005_596	b	Yeah . Yeah . ; So , um ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_965	s	This is this is not what I was suggesting to do . ; u Look , I I think this is a ; Really ? ; One once It 's a I used to work , like , on voiced on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this kind of thing .
Bmr029_370	ba	OK . So , do we w also want to run that bottom experiment without retraining the short male models on his thing ? ; Did you want that ? ; Or ? ; Um , I I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do ,
Bro004_1309	bk	It 's OK . ; Well this table took uh more than five days to get back . ; We ; Yeah .
Btr001_1248	bk	Yeah , ; that 's right too . ; Yep . ; Oh , OK ,
Btr001_2220	aa	Mm - hmm . ; kind of , ; yeah , yeah . ; yeah .
Bro027_1441	b	But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different . ; So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space ; but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else . ; Uh - huh .
Bro016_69	s	Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so the next question to ask , which is I think the one that that that Andreas was dre addressing himself to in the lunch meeting , is , um , we 're not supposed to adjust the back - end , ; but anybody using the system would .
Bro005_1426	bk	but mmm , ; I don't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know ; We just select what works fine ; OK .
Bro024_1165	bk	Yeah , there are two curves . ; Yeah . ; One curve 's for the close - talking microphone , which is the lower curve . ; Ah , OK .
Bed015_1558	s	Yeah . ; So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which aren't . ; Right . ; And again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that .
Bed011_790	x	You could say " some " in there . ; I must say that thi this one looks a bit strange to me . ; Um maybe It seems like appropriate if I go to Las Vegas . ; Well but I decide k kind of how much money uh I 'm willing to lose .
Bmr006_95	s	OK . ; But maybe that 's enough . ; So , in general , I was thinking more data ; but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar ,
Bro011_548	x	You 're playing ? ; Huh ? ; You 're playing ? ; Yes , I 'm playing .
Bro024_1010	s	Uh , there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um , uh , having a further constraining of the latency . ; So we 're s just continuing to keep aware of what the trade - offs are and , you know , what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies ? ; Mmm . ; But since we always seem to at least get something out of longer latencies not being so constrained , we 're tending to go with that if we 're not told we can't do it .
Bro010_1114	s	And , uh ; Hmm . ; Yeah , ; I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time .
Bmr025_548	cc	I 'm not doing anything . ; I I know why . ; And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , " oh what did Chuck do , ; OK I 'll do that " .
Bro007_530	s	so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh we won't be changing the training on anything
Bmr013_301	s	They came up with some compromise . ; Because that really wasn't what it look like . ; Right . ; It didn't look like a sequence of phones
Bro027_227	b	So , ; um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr021_747	s	So the SRI system also does um vocal tract length normalization ; and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features . ; So that 's one difference . ; And the other difference is that in the , uh in the SRI system , the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest .
Bed009_513	s	Yeah . ; Right ? ; So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi , ; let 's say .
Bmr016_1610	aa	So CTS is really big here , ; Yeah , I wonder what it is . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_475	b	so , ; Mm - hmm . ; there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things . ; Right .
Bed017_264	t3	i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ? ; Yeah . ; Um , uh these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ? ; I can't really see the whole thing .
Bmr028_1171	%--	uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too . ; I wanna ask , um So , you know that the data I ' v I have upgraded it considerably . ; So I 've probably made I probably corrected something like , ; well , s
Btr002_746	s	No , a I think ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully .
Bmr019_1836	bk	Well ; Mmm . ; Wow . ; Oh .
Bro025_722	s	Hmm . ; Um , silence was by its own self . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , um , v vocalic was clustered .
Bmr014_44	%--	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Huh . ; And I don't know what the e electronics is but .
Btr001_1448	b	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed , ; and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_630	%--	One suggestion I have is that um I think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these , ; right ? ; Right . ; I think we should read some more because because this is very f
Bmr028_1372	%--	And it 's not a very smart system . ; It it only knows what we give it . ; And if w If it knows more than we would really give it when it runs , we call it cheating . ; But it 's
Bmr031_852	%	the total meeting time is seventy - five hours . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um So , ; Oh .
Bed002_1258	bk	n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , ; in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro014_327	aa	i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first ; and then do the ; Combine error rates ; Yeah .
Btr002_689	b	Oh . ; Hmm . ; i in al an uh an irrelevant non - wanted artifact . ; Yeah .
Bed014_349	aa	so that the ; Um . ; And sometimes it 's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one ; Yeah .
Bed005_735	s	Right . ; and all those things . ; Right . ; Now , we hav the the whole Unfortunately , the whole database is , uh , in German .
Bmr005_1432	%--	it 's like , you know , the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks , ; it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small . ; And um a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . ; Well , even I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about
Bmr003_555	s	So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it , ; and identify the speaker . ; And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker . ; But other people are interested in for example stress marking .
Bro023_1001	%--	Actually I have a recursion that computes ; Yeah , let me go back a little bit . ; Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , uh , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . ; You can uh compute ,
Bmr024_1400	s	Well , now it 's the same . ; It 's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz . ; Yeah . ; Exp - one 's triangular , one 's trapezoidal .
Bro023_1747	aa	and Yeah . ; The energy also . ; The energy . ; Yeah . Of course .
Bmr011_1716	aa	I guess Dan Ellis and you ; Dan , ; yeah . ; Yep .
Bns002_748	fa	That 's the main thing . ; And as , uh ; And how do you ; sorry Miguel
Bed010_419	%	and ; Doesn't matter . ; Um , just any like like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best . ; OK .
Bmr031_1368	s	And noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation . ; So , um , uh , there 's that one thing that @ @ been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the in the Aurora , uh , team . ; And so , uh , they 've got some software ; and I 'm think of of just having us integrate that in ,
Bro003_1247	s	Ad - Adam Adam did some testing . ; Or either Adam or or Dan did some testing ; and they found that the SPERT board 's still still faster . ; And the benefits is that , you know , you run out of SPERT and then you can do other things on your your computer ,
Bro017_487	b	Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection , ; we say " well you know how come ? " ; Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1609	qw	Do you know what I 'm saying ? ; " The person who 's doing the transcript " The IBM people ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ?
Bmr027_833	b	No , no , no . This is different . ; This is not So , I I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bed011_1076	b	And so , exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sure . ; OK .
Bro018_885	aa	So . ; Yeah . ; So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out . ; Yeah .
Bro022_1159	%--	Uh - huh . ; but I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . ; I don't know . ; It 's k it 's k
Bmr016_536	s	and I wouldn't take the inflated version . ; So he talks about the woman being " two - derful " , ; and ; and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read .
Btr002_1571	bh	But ; Yeah , there 's some Those are those are nice . ; I 'm not a big ice cream fan . ; Really ?
Bed014_1356	aa	Yeah . We actually have I think we have been making progress , ; and its sort of surprising . ; Yeah . ; I I I I definitely get that impression . Yeah .
Bmr020_365	s	Right . ; Right ? ; So we scored everything , ; and I must say the NIST scoring tools are pretty nice for this ,
Buw001_1119	aa	the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? ; We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? ; Are are we gonna try and o ; Yeah .
Bro016_737	no	What what 's the , um ? ; Do you kno recall if the insertions were were higher with MSG ? ; I don't know . ; I cannot tell .
Bmr022_689	s	so if you have if you have a th if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred , or or you know . ; Just ; Just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth ? ; There 's one file .
Bmr003_2110	b	No . ; And leave them loose ? ; That looks like a semi - circle . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1140	%	and you 'd add up the total evidence for " V " , " E " , and " A " . ; Mmm . ; I don't think you can do this , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_680	b	Which I 'm interested in . ; I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed003_212	%--	Right ? ; Right . ; Yep . ; And uh , so we
Bmr019_1954	ar	You mean that the the grouping is supposed to be synchronized ? ; Yeah , sure . ; No . ; No , no .
Btr001_1517	b	Yeah . ; It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , ; and we don't know exactly how they do it ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_519	no	using the close - talking I think would be much better . ; Wouldn't it ? ; Yeah . ; Um . I I don't know .
Bro014_1407	qw	Mmm . ; Hmm . ; The spectral subtraction is being done ; at what level ? Is it being done
Bmr014_1145	s	Mm - hmm . ; What it comes down to but ; Yeah I think actually ; my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good .
Bro023_1231	s	Uh , ; people d done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets . ; And it 's not a bad thing to do . ; It 's another approach .
Bro017_202	ba	Because you already uh had the noise uh in a ; And it was working at the time . ; It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but ; if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious .
Bsr001_2340	s	Um , ; Oh , cool . ; and so we 're just having we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know , you know , " there was a big gap in time here ; but , they " you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done ,
Btr001_2106	b	and they 've d actually done some they 've had some good results in terms of the digits ; which they do in terms of having a r a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing , meeting after meeting after meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bed005_968	cc	and , so , I r really knew this at one time . ; Ugh . ; But , I I It 's not only uh Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together . ; So I 'll dig up some more stuff from Dekai .
Bmr024_879	s	What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ? ; Yeah . ; That was me . ; I was the one who said it was not reliable .
Bmr031_166	ba	OK . So also , um ; You mean , pi will be close to one half ? ; Well , not mathematically . ; That 's new .
Bmr009_1598	%--	So . This one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Now , tha Now , if we develop further then , y uh , I don't
Bmr016_80	s	Mm - hmm . ; as opposed to connected digits . ; Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set , ; but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff .
Bmr007_108	b	So , six is , uh two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_588	s	Mm - hmm . ; and and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something ; and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti ; so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power
Btr002_3131	s	So if it 's " er " , I write an " R " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; If it 's " mmm " , I can tell it 's
Bro027_615	%--	but , nnn ; So ; Yeah . ; So if you if you put the delta before the , uh , ana on - line If
Bro005_706	s	Except if the features are bad ; uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . ; In this case the tandem is still better ; even if it 's trained on not on the target digits .
Bed008_853	s	For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . ; That 's what we talked about . ; um ; well , I think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have ,
Bmr008_646	qh	And in terms of the more open ones , we have the we 're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who will be participating in the meeting data . ; We can find it We can resolve certain issues later , if ; Mmm . ; Yeah , and the question is how extensive this gets .
Bmr011_1418	%--	and I don't really know what would exist in it . ; But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , ; Mm - hmm . ; or
Bed015_156	s	which I thought was a little bit too order - biased ; Well ; Th ; and " semantic bindings " ,
Bed011_1122	bk	but ; Well the th the thing is there 's a lot that needs to be done to get this right . ; OK , I th ; OK .
Bmr003_1059	aa	Why ? ; Because they wanted a lot more detail ? ; No . ; Right .
Bmr022_63	ba	I 've noticed that . Yeah . ; One of the things that Adam said that I thought would be a good idea would be , um , if we g used different beeps . ; And so there may be ; Which makes sense .
Bro024_1559	s	wha what I observed is that for Italian and Spanish , when you go to thirty and twenty - five DB , uh it it 's good . ; OK . ; Oh . ; It stays In this range ,
Bmr012_1101	%--	so . ; Uh y right ; Without getting more stuff . ; cuz
Bro023_577	%--	which is ; which is , ; um , ; t
Bro005_619	s	we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , ; um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , ; um . ; So we 'll perhaps start something next week .
Bro025_169	s	So it so , um , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before . ; Uh , but , you know , looking at it another way , maybe more importantly , uh , we didn't have any explicit noise , uh , handling
Buw001_208	%--	Right . ; We can go back . ; So , ; uh , u u
Bro011_567	s	and got the same results that um that uh Stephane had . ; So um I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to uh to improve it . ; So . ; One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models
Bro027_1438	s	And PCA doesn't do that . ; It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically . ; Right . ; But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different .
Bmr024_1568	t1	Yep . ; and ; Thank you for the box , ; and I 'll just go buy their process .
Bed016_1048	b	Hmm ? ; you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , ; I don't know . ; Mmm .
Bed009_1029	b	OK ? ; And and we could you could do this . ; And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know ; Mmm .
Bro018_77	s	I don't use that ; I can't use ; No , ; I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use .
Bed008_1410	fa	A vector of the weights as the se ; Yeah , it could ; oh . ; Sorry ?
Bro022_321	no	Right . ; I trained on clean TI - digits . ; I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . ; But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .
Bed003_1027	ar	I didn't n Is there an ampersand in DOS ? ; Nope . ; Just s l start up a new DOS . ; We - That 's alright .
Bmr022_1122	s	it just some user like " meeting - root " or something . ; Oh , OK . ; I don't know . ; I mean , I 'm not too worried ,
Bro004_643	s	and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to HTK . ; Um Mmm . ; So basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , ; these are the results we obtained for Italian uh with straight mmm , PLP features using on - line normalization .
Bed008_1538	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro021_836	b	That maybe , ; well , it 's too clean ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2399	b	Your your junk is our , uh , training data . ; Treat especially ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_629	qy	Is is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ? ; Yeah . ; What they ; or , is is that our data which we are collecting here ,
Bmr031_990	s	but I I 'm pretty sure that there 's nothing this week . ; OK . ; OK . ; And then I 'll also re - number
Bro027_1964	s	When ; When do you leave ? ; Uh , I 'm leaving next Wednesday . ; May or may not be in in the morning .
Bed012_652	s	U Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Or the earthquake and the alarm . ; Sorry . Yeah , I 'm confusing two .
Bmr024_244	s	I sort of thought if I do it in sets groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current . ; Uh - huh . ; And and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , for the for the , um , the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . ; So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is .
Bmr014_537	aa	Yeah . ; But she knew that she didn't know it . ; Maybe it was a technical ter ; exactly .
Bmr008_695	ba	Yeah , so this is why I ; Well , It 's that 's not a problem though , ; So so th ; I mean . That would be a good question to ask ,
Bed003_510	b	but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ? ; Well , we ; To do that we would add another uh value for that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_463	s	Well . Uh , what was supposed to happen ? ; I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones , ; so , um , you know , I don't have a write - up of or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about ; Hmm , yeah . I think I think we already came to the conclusion that we have two alternative paths that we two alternative ways of representing it .
Bro010_290	%--	it was something like that . ; I don't think you can really tell . ; A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , ; and
Bmr012_1079	2	Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK ; it 's just the the ; Right , ; it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .
Bed010_261	bk	Oh ! ; But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something . ; Yeah . ; OK ,
Bsr001_1381	aa	But I mean I u u as long as that makes sense , then it 's nice to have a variety of tasks , right ? ; To have sort of , you know , different ; Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar . ; And Yeah .
Btr001_2707	d	Right . ; and you know , maybe there 'd be ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's optional .
Bmr007_884	bk	And probably is not so easy when you use the the PDA , eh that Because the signal is , eh the in the e energy level . ; Right . ; in in that , eh eh speech file is , eh more similar . ; Right .
Bmr006_1174	s	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right ; But that 's ; that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one
Bmr011_826	s	Uh , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . ; I need to acquaint myself more with it . ; But , um , there there is a way of viewing ; Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each each of them .
Bmr012_647	ba	um ; Sorry can't remember . ; anyway it 's ; Congratulations
Buw001_1505	no	Mm - hmm . ; and and if someone becomes more interested we could work our way up . ; I I 'm ; I I 'm not so sure I agree with that .
Bmr003_711	aa	Well , a couple things . ; First of all the time marking you 'd get you could get by a tool . ; Wow . ; That 's true .
Bro013_481	s	and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two , ; For this one . ; For the noi ; this big , to here , they are to signal .
Bmr011_1570	qh	Yes . ; I bet he did . ; American English ? ; Oh , really .
Bmr011_348	%--	Yeah . ; That would be really neat . ; but they might wanna just , uh , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them ; Um , I also had a discussion
Bmr020_905	s	And that 's the purpose . ; Yeah . ; So tomorrow , when we go to make the um uh , chunked file for IBM , we 're going to actually compare the two . ; So he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting ,
Bro025_712	b	Yeah . So , um , a better way would be something more more data - driven , ; Mm - hmm . ; just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_804	aa	So , i this is gonna mean ; Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1904	b	Yeah , but I don't actually remember what it was . ; But that was Eric did that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_239	bk	Yeah . ; Oy ! OK . ; Uh , so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent . ; Ninety .
Btr001_1685	aa	sometimes the segmenter will ; I mean you 've said things that weren't caught on the pre - segmenter , ; like whispers , kind of . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1468	b	They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Alright .
Bed011_975	aa	With nothing . ; No , no . ; Just talking into a box and not hearing anything back . ; Yep .
Bro005_710	b	Yeah . So it sounds like yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization . ; Yeah . ; But if you can do good normalization it 's it 's uh OK . ; Yeah .
Bro025_451	%--	and So . ; I think it 's OK . ; OK . ; You have , um
Bed006_1178	s	It can be either A , B or C . ; Um . So is it a fixed number or or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen ; uh ; it 's it 's it 's flexible .
Bro026_211	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1559	ba	Cou - i e I mean , y ; So . ; Yeah . ; but it 's definitely great to have the other one .
Bro028_576	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . It 's it 's gonna be hard . ; Um , ; they 're I I 'm still waiting for them to release the , um , multi - CPU version of their scripts ,
Bdb001_688	s	f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences . ; And another segmentation is in terms of , um , I don't know , prosodic phrases . ; And let 's say that they don't nest . ; So , you know , a prosodic phrase may cross two sentences or something .
Bro013_535	s	I think that this is good . ; This is quite similar . ; this is this is another frame . ; ho how I obtained the envelope , this envelope , with the mel filter bank .
Bmr029_348	%--	Yeah . ; The big variation is by whether it 's a native speaker or not . ; Yeah . ; And whether it 's , um
Bmr006_1269	qw	Yep . ; Oh yeah yeah . OK . ; Yeah . ; What looked different ?
Bns002_666	s	So , uh ; our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values , ; these uh the area , the covered area , for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value , ; so we can reduce the not - used space for other simultaneous transmissions .
Bro003_1393	bs	I necessary to convert . ; And someti ; well ; So you 're just having a problem converting the labels .
Bro007_539	qo	uh uh so ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; What ?
Bmr007_461	aa	No , I I agree with that . ; That 's all . ; I 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting . ; Oh yeah .
Bsr001_2409	%--	Right , ; right . ; uh . ; There 'll be a common
Bns001_439	%	So , this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme ; or ; Now , I would like not to hear only three opinions . ; Hm
Bmr018_1664	s	that 's that 's gonna be better . ; Yep . ; because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on ; and then that 's it for the r for all of time .
Bmr003_615	b	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money ; Right .
Bmr010_1379	b	Ah . ; it 's only speech or it 's it 's it 's nonspeech . ; That 's right . But I think Javier 's ; Yeah .
Bed005_1303	%--	we have to get them to ; So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to , either ; We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields , ; or some way to associate
Bro008_139	s	of of and the I mean it 's not To to look in speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech , ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; that 's p that 's not that uncommon .
Bmr014_36	aa	so I ; Oh really . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed006_774	b	which is ; Which which we 're abbreviating as " RAD " . ; Good . ; Hmm .
Bro007_9	s	So combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network ; and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the MSG features . ; And so these low - pass filtered goes through M eh another MLP ; and then the linear output of these two MLP 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this KLT .
Bmr031_144	s	Yeah . ; And then of that , there 's , uh , a little sliver ; I could try and draw it ; but it 's probably better to describe .
Bed010_895	s	Just checking . ; No sir . ; Alright . ; Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK .
Bro014_1035	b	Uh , we distend the we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f filter , ; Mm - hmm . ; and we extend these coefficient between the all the frequency range . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_961	%--	It if i loo it it it it it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops , ; It things don't converge , yeah . ; uh R recursive action ? ; you just you have to
Bmr031_339	b	or ? ; Well , again the hope is that , uh I mean , it 's it 's looking I mean , I have to ask these folks ; but , uh , my impression is that the , um , IBM path is looking , you know , more promising . ; Yep .
Bmr014_614	aa	now as they ; before there were they were some in in the log domain and I I changed this to the to the ; Cu - Cube root ? ; Yeah .
Bro010_1073	s	Well , yeah , ; but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , ; right ? ; So you 'd get the word right .
Bmr019_1172	b	We 're ; from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files , ; which essentially has it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration . ; Great .
Bmr023_1045	s	I forget . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean these were all different databases and different you know , in HTK and all that ,
Bmr010_1427	bs	And so I I think it would work fine for detecting overlap . ; It 's just , uh , that i it ; he has the two - pass issue that ; What he does is , as a first pass he he p he does , um , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates .
Bsr001_172	ba	Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine . ; Ah ! ; Oh . ; But it it 's really good .
Btr002_3039	bk	Hmm . ; So like I I 've been doing that ; because like that 's what I can hear . ; OK .
Bmr014_289	s	So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect . ; So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave . ; Right . ; I 've already done five or six sets .
Bmr025_1020	s	Do we have anything else ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs
Bed016_171	cc	OK . ; Sorry . ; current formalism thing that you presented . ; OK . I will .
Bro026_803	s	and , uh , you know , ; Would it be better if I asked Hari to ask Joe ? ; Uh . ; Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , " Hari , hopefully this is OK with you " .
Bmr012_658	s	and people can look at them ; um so ; We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . ; That 's you know if if there are more machines um uh here
Bed013_598	s	OK . ; Well , ; We 'll just uh ; I would say that 's closer to six pages actually .
Bmr012_227	bk	yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , ; That 's not good . ; um ; Yeah
Bed005_421	%--	Yeah . ; And so whenever I just say , " Write " , it will it will put this in here . ; Oh , so it always just ; Is it So it
Bmr031_1311	s	Um , and apparently they get reasonable results ; except in some portions they get very high insertion rates ; even higher than we get with with the , um like even , you know , on lapel mikes with , uh , background speech . ; And so they were trying to track that down ,
Bmr003_1914	s	Well so then th ; Try try to s consolidate . ; I mean , who wants to do that though ? ; the other side is , yeah .
Bmr029_288	%--	Oh . ; Uh , I I ; I don't have I don't have a good gue ; I mean , is is it like a day or is it a few hours or
Bro007_285	qw	Um what else is there here ? ; Um see the second second from the bottom it says SIL , ; but this is some different kind of silence or thing or ; what was that ?
Bmr003_1682	aa	Right . ; And it can be m edited after the fact , ; can't it also ? ; Yes .
Bro013_788	s	OK . ; Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it . ; But I realized that that um when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero . ; And uh cuz because uh i it 's two syllables .
Bmr003_1195	bs	Mm - hmm . ; That 's right . ; Um , ; so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to to do graduate students .
Bmr013_725	b	I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . ; Wow , interesting . ; That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . ; OK .
Bed011_1131	aa	And I responded to him , also rather lengthy , how he should do the action planning . ; And ; " Action planning " meaning " Discourse Modeling " ? ; Yes .
Bmr006_293	s	Eh and probably . I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device .
Bmr012_618	s	there 's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well ; so ; but but there 's other phenomena , ; it 's a meeting ,
Bro015_129	s	I guess it was just the result that he sent , ; so . Um . ; What was that again ? ; He just used the spectral subtraction and the LDA filters I guess Mmm .
Bns001_573	s	just to see if we are doing the same , or if we are doing something similar . ; It would be important for us to to highlight the differences . ; Yeah . ; Because if not , well , they can say , " Oh , you are doing the same thing . "
Bmr009_792	s	One 's a digit form , ; one 's a speaker form . ; Oh ! ; So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits .
Bro012_889	ba	and that 's what uh we 've already observed . ; But uh , ; yeah , ; voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither .
Bsr001_1627	aa	You p you plan to to train actually models based on this data . ; Mmm . ; That 's good . ; Oh , absolutely .
Btr002_301	s	Yep . ; You know , but I never usually put period and then new word " so " unless it 's like , end of the sentence and then , " So . " ; " What are we gonna do now , " ; but they don't say that .
Buw001_1345	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about . ; And also , I like the idea of going around the room ,
Btr001_306	b	yeah . ; Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting . ; I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1392	bk	You you happy ? ; You 're happy . ; OK everyone should be happy . ; OK .
Btr002_701	b	Exa - I agree . ; Uh ; And that 's that 's th you know , I would watch the visual sis signal to avoid that . ; Oh yeah .
Bmr021_642	s	Right . ; Um , ; Thilo , you had you wanted to talk about the ; Yeah , I had one one short point .
Bmr013_928	s	you did one ? ; I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , ; and that was just without looking too hard for it , ; so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer .
Bmr020_765	%--	Or ; You n Remember she was ; Oh she wanted that also ? ; Well she was saying that it would be nice if we had they had a
Bro016_263	s	Even though it 's it 's it 's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back - end , and it 's ar artificial here that we 're not adjusting those , you certainly don't wanna be adjusting those all the time . ; Hmm . ; And if you have a nice front - end that 's in roughly the right range ; I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level ,
Bed011_489	b	tourists maybe a bit different ; Yeah , I guess so . ; and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_825	ar	I OK . ; I have to ask you something , ; is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , that would help . ; No .
Bmr010_1540	s	But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ? ; Eh , I mean , the , uh the , uh the BIC criterion , ; the the t to train the the Gaussian , ; eh , using the the mark , eh , by hand , eh , eh , to distinguish be mmm , to train overlapping zone and speech zone . I mean ,
Bro016_440	%--	But you ma you may really wanna add other things later anyway ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; because you
Bmr016_1853	%	A lot of these are me ; He he s he said he said get ; the the " beep is said with a high pit high pitch and lengthening . " ; To head .
Btr001_1672	b	but also if they have it all pre - segmented and they can only hear the segments , they often miss what 's in between ; because they didn't even have the option of listening to what 's in between . ; You mean the transcribers ? ; Right .
Btr002_2448	co	Ah . ; but , um , ; The one you 're talking ab ; and and you said , " Don't do " lipsmack " ,
Bro010_1022	h	Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? ; Other low level detectors ? ; Yeah . ; Um ,
Bro014_840	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So we have the mel f filter bank , ; we have the FFT ,
Bro008_97	bk	And the best result of any system was about fifty - four , ; where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate . ; Oh , ; OK .
Bed015_2103	s	which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh ; Grout out the things that that you need . ; Right . ; then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper .
Bro012_1454	b	So I would I would believe that uh it was quite likely that ; um ; looking at envelope only , that we 'd be significantly worse than that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_600	s	They don't discuss the admission fee . ; Make that false . ; Alright . ; And it 's night .
Bmr007_902	b	And the the another question , that when I review the the the work of Javier . ; I think the , nnn , the , nnn , that the idea of using a neural network to to get a broad class of phonetic , eh from , eh uh a candidate from the the the speech signal . ; If you have , eh uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh only consider , eh like candidate , the , nnn , eh the silence , because it is the the only model , eh eh , he used that , eh eh nnn , to detect the the possibility of a a change between the between the speaker , ; Right .
Bro018_826	s	I guess I don't think that the normalization difference is gonna account for everything . ; So what I was working on is um just going through and checking the headers of the wavefiles , ; OK . ; to see if maybe there was a um a certain type of compression or something that was done that my script wasn't catching .
Bro018_70	aa	Another one is but the other one is the spectral shape . ; I I 'll ; The spectral shape , ; yeah .
Bmr016_1596	s	Right and sometimes , I mean , you see a couple of these that are actually " OK 's " ; so it 's it 's may be that they got to the point where I mean it was low enough understandable ; understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said " OK . " ; You know , so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym ,
Bro012_258	%--	Yeah . OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results ; on other test set or it
Bsr001_2477	b	Yeah . ; Greasy wash water , ; I know the numbers that were used ; oh .
Bed003_580	bk	Just like uh , maybe the fact that they use a certain verb ; OK . ; Actually forget the verb . ; OK .
Bro023_1061	b	But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , so , it 's , uh , three point , uh , eight . ; Uh - huh .
Bro005_1025	s	And if you know that ; So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . ; Assume that 's the p the feature . ; look at these different ways of combining it .
Bmr007_314	b	right ? ; Yeah . ; They 're not double counted . ; Yeah .
Bed012_899	b	But if you said something that was completel er ; h theoretically the construction parser would do that ; But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever , n people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1558	aa	No . Eh , well , British is OK . ; But but ; He said British was OK ? ; Sure , sure , sure .
Bro016_149	%--	Remember we were seeing the SRI system was so much better than the tandem system . ; Hmm . ; Part of it might just be that the SRI system , they they they always adjust these things to be sort of optimized , ; Is there ?
Bed015_1944	b	Or me . ; Anyways ; There 's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where where it goes where some guy goes , " every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . " ; Right .
Btr002_493	b	Yeah , it 's really a an odd task in in a way ; because they 're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_441	%--	And then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . ; Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot . ; So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , " OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get " , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . ; But but the other question is
Bmr003_2122	%	A " sleeping policeman " ! ; That 's good . ; There we go ; s
Bmr027_399	s	And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before ; you know , a little bit earlier than ; Well ; It 's much easier to explain this way .
Bmr024_1429	%	So the oth the other thing that ; Yeah . ; So , f ; i
Bed014_452	bk	Mm - hmm . ; But at at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now . ; Right , t t if to the extent that we have it , let 's write it ; OK .
Bsr001_1668	%--	So . ; Yeah . ; We may end up having to do that . ; Well it 's
Bdb001_807	%--	The whole point is that the text and the lattice are isomorphic . ; They represent each other completely . ; Um ; So that
Bmr016_225	aa	And you 're saying two hours , uh , is digits , ; so that 's roughly the ratio then , ; something like twenty twenty to one . ; Yep .
Bro017_95	bk	essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech , ; because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah .
Bro027_149	s	Yeah . ; But , um ; but it 's still pretty noisy . ; Even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy .
Bmr003_1186	bk	Cuz it 's easier . ; Right , ; these are linguistics grad students . ; That 's right .
Bed002_988	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_69	b	Yeah . ; D - Day . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1386	ba	Yeah . ; Well maybe that 's the best way to go , ; just ; How interesting !
Bed005_1010	g	Yeah , ; E - EVA , right ? ; Yeah . ; Enter , V View , Approach , right ?
Bmr005_293	s	I sorta knew I was doing it but it was ; Well , I still don't know who " he " is . ; I I do I don't remember who " he " is . ; No , you have to say , you still don't know who " he " is , with that prosody .
Bmr013_517	%	Yeah . ; So , I mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . ; And then , um , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2764	s	But I don't always do it . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . I 've seen a few of them ,
Bmr018_1542	b	Or ; Yeah . ; You know ? ; Huh .
Bro024_1475	aa	Yeah . ; So you shift it somehow . ; This this whole curve is shifted again . ; Right .
Btr001_1047	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; Once in a while .
Bro003_959	ar	What ? ; w Don't we need to put in the column for noise conditions ? ; Are you just trying to be difficult ? ; No ,
Btr001_1908	b	I just wanted to know what Liz looked like . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 've never gotten to see her . ; Nn - mm .
Btr001_1205	s	Yeah . ; OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation . ; There was another impro another improvement in that ; Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint .
Bro024_1269	bk	Yeah . ; Oh , it 's trained on Italian ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr009_604	b	I mean , he we 're not paying him the full RA - ship for all the time . ; So . um If we got it to where we wanted we needed someone to do that ; I don't think there 's really enough data where where ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_223	s	Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance .
Bmr011_1300	b	That would be really nice to offer those things with that wide range . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah
Bro027_620	s	Yeah ; uh then then it could go in parallel . ; Cuz i ; And then y then you don't have that additive
Bed014_829	%	Like . ; so we 'll we 'll find a way . ; Right . ; I can
Bmr029_539	s	But Um ; A and by the way , ; What wo ; it 's actually we 're we 're already If we use the same segmentations that we use for the close - talking microphone , then the segmentations assume that we have access to all channels
Bmr023_434	s	There is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what I do is I merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . ; which one would be good . ; Yeah . ; So it 's not a pure it 's not a pure condition .
Bmr013_309	b	There was no name for that . ; Yeah . ; But Right . ; Yeah .
Bed009_320	b	Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing . ; Hmm . ; So that 's a a discrete decision . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1103	ft	With what ? ; Right . Mixed . ; the the mix , mixed speech . ; " Mixed " . Thank you .
Bmr020_1775	%--	Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it . ; They 'll be marking it all over the place . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I s
Bed004_207	qy	great . ; So first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her . ; Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well . ; Um , do you know exactly how to do that ,
Bed006_954	s	and it 's gonna part of the M - three - L AP API filed by the end of this year ; so that this means we can start using it basically now . ; Mm - hmm . ; But this is a technical detail .
Bed003_1245	s	Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . ; I mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it .
Bro017_368	%--	If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less . ; Mmm . ; The moment you moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands . ; So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of
Bed008_999	t1	Oops . ; Have to get used to this . ; OK , ; whoops .
Bmr010_626	%--	Maybe , uh , uh , brief ; Well , let 's why don't we talk about microphone issues ? ; Yeah . That 'd be great . ; That was that was a
Bro004_615	bk	OK , ; alright , I see . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed017_250	s	that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . ; And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever , ; and then plan a route . ; Um - hmm , um , well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner ,
Bro018_87	s	Mm - hmm . ; So if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced .
Bmr023_353	s	And this way it 'll I mean , I got really a lot of response for for my notice ; and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to . ; Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event ; and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way
Bro007_521	s	In which case ; so I I uh well we should look ; but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday . ; Um so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath
Bmr003_926	bk	Oh , I see what you mean . ; Yeah . ; I mean , that that 's easy enough . ; Right .
Bro017_642	s	you know , ; uh in the ; Oh . ; you know , just compress the whole vector .
Bro003_776	s	Uh , well . ; Yeah , ; so Carmen brought the Spanish , ; and Stephane brought the French .
Bmr019_701	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , so that was one big factor that helped improve things ; and then the other thing was that , ; you know , as Liz said the we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous .
Bmr029_971	s	Yeah . ; Uh , you can just use it from the ; Yeah . Basically from the command line , ; and the defining the phones , whatever you want to have synthesized ,
Bsr001_1906	s	So you 're sort of iteratively normalizing as you go through the ; So . ; But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar . ; The language models probably won't be .
Bro004_556	b	on ; you probably must have this lined up to do . ; To try the same t with the exact same training , do testing on the other languages . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_153	s	Good . ; and so that these tools do all that . ; And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it ; well uh to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings .
Bro010_1239	s	uh , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , ; as we as we have over there . ; If there is ? ; An obstruction between them .
Bmr027_1505	s	but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , ; which should be an interesting ; When 's it due ? ; The t paper isn't due until August .
Bro017_531	b	Mm - hmm . ; you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm !
Bed003_1285	s	Precisely . ; So . ; One thing that 's kind of been bugging me when I more I look at this is that the ; I guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output .
Bro018_783	s	Uh . ; So you recognize a phone and which ever phone was recognized , you spit out it 's vector of ones and zeros . ; Mm - hmm . ; I expect you could do that .
Bsr001_971	s	I mean , it 's it 's it 's still , you know , understandable . ; OK , you guys are more in business that I am . ; But it @ @ bu ; The host probably gets , uh , you know gets a little bit more .
Btr002_3214	b	Right . ; Right . ; It 's just like different ways of saying " and " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1100	%	I mean the idea is to ; I don't ; Alright , OK . ; Hhh .
Bmr010_1202	%--	and I don't know ; uh , this this is very possibly a different , uh , topic . ; But , uh , just let me say with reference to this idea of , um , higher - order organization within meetings . ; So like in a
Bed016_1016	s	OK . I was like , " Huh ? ; It was here . " ; Like Um . ; But anyway th so there are there are cases like that .
Bmr019_654	b	Yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files . ; Uh ; So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_539	ba	Yeah . ; and so ; You you had three different versions , with different , like , pause thresholds between the segments ? ; Great .
Bed003_1163	s	So you got more slides ? ; Do I have more slides ? ; Um yes , ; one more .
Bmr003_2100	%--	Velcro . ; Uh , ; and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around ; so my model is to get a a a p piece of
Bmr025_208	b	Uh - huh . ; Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_939	bk	So , uh ; Um , ; anyway . That 's my thought . ; OK .
Bro013_370	x	Well . So that 's a problem . ; Yeah . ; Yeah but ; nnn .
Bed002_1128	b	I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . ; I believe . ; I don't I don't see ; Hmm .
Bmr031_357	s	at least for for for meetings or or digits or anything . ; But , uh , if if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something . ; Yeah . ; Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that
Bed002_564	b	Yeah . Exactly . ; Right . ; Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah . ; Right .
Btr001_2421	aa	he does that a lot . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_162	bk	And right now we can have up to six . ; Right . ; And we have five , we 're getting one more . ; Yeah .
Bed004_101	s	and those were the l uh uh ; I should say the system was supposed to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to solve , with a human ; Um . ; There are here are uh the results .
Bed006_103	ba	and um um next to some some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she 's also the wizard in the data collection ; Of Oz . ; Um , ; It 's very exciting .
Buw001_2272	aa	Yeah , I think ; Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bro005_550	%--	Uh , yeah . ; And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . ; Mmm . ; And , um , so this is just setting them to be ,
Btr001_1352	g	Do they get them , um ; I don't know . ; Id - Is ; They don't have like an interface , right ?
Bro027_823	s	for the decision ; Yeah . ; from the committee . ; Uh , but I started to play with the , um , uh , tandem neural network .
Bed004_120	bk	OK . ; One time , pretending to be a system , ; one time , to pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending . ; OK .
Bed015_1019	bd	right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line ; and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . ; Right . ; And sort of this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this .
Bro004_444	%--	See , I thought you showed me something like that last week . ; You had a you had a little ; Uh , No , I don't think so . ; Um What
Bmr016_151	bk	So ; We can go back to the other thing later . ; I mean we s we we 've We can do this for awhile ; OK .
Bmr001_397	bk	Cuz no , we 've only no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that ; We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro027_1712	bk	Well , I mean , we have we are transferring the VAD to the back - end ; feature to the back - end . ; Because we are dropping it at the back - end after everything all the features are computed . ; Oh , oh , I see .
Bed005_962	s	I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well . ; Uh , so I I 've been in contact with Wu , ; so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , uh , what he 's doing . ; It 's just a little embarrassing
Bed002_416	s	is , uh , one , where do you get this i information from , ; and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? ; So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? ; And you probably need intermediate nodes .
Bmr002_827	aa	He says that uh in German " selbst " is used in two different ways ; so you have It either means uh " himself " or it means " even " ; and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_308	b	Oh ? ; That 's not the first question . ; Well , Well , I guess . ; OK .
Bed016_719	s	um Um . ; Join the club . ; Right . Oh , h that 's ; " On the bus " is a m is a metaphorical metonymy
Bmr020_337	s	Anyway , ; so it 's uh ; That was that was one set of results , ; and then the second one was just basically the the stuff we had in the in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance .
Bmr003_301	b	Mm - hmm . ; And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc , ; um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard . ; Hmm .
Bmr022_816	b	but it they bounce around . ; We have lots o of choices of microphones . ; I mean , can we keep the microphones , and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_902	b	So , uh So , uh , I was just going to ask , ; um , so , ; what is the the basic thing that that you are , um , obligated to do , um , uh , by the summer before w uh y c we can move ; Ah !
Bmr016_836	bk	You can access it from anywhere in ICSI . N ; OK . ; In fact , this is an eighteen gig drive , or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen ; Alright .
Bmr008_509	s	Hmm . ; You mean like you know southern US , or northeastern or ; It - I think it would be however you would identify your own . ; And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in , because there would be there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for you know , one for each type .
Bed002_908	s	Uh - huh . ; and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . ; Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . ; It 's a student of Eve 's .
Btr001_975	b	and the same thing for , um , well " the " . " The " versus " the " ; that there are those known variants , and ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_666	b	So . ; You know , you shouldn't be more than ; like You should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel . ; Yeah .
Bro017_365	s	and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band . ; Hmm . ; Unless this noise is modulated . ; If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less .
Bed015_720	s	I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it . ; Yeah . ; I that 's fine . ; I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .
Bns002_279	b	we are um reserving a certain , and a specific uh , area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time . ; OK ? ; This is the basic idea . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2306	aa	so you connect you collect digits in conversation ; or or individ ; No , no , I have people read them . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr031_97	qw	Um , I think Brian is on vacation now ; but , uh , before he left we gave him , uh , another set of meetings to give to the transcribers . ; And ; How many ?
Bsr001_1104	s	I mean , uh , this this thing is also for you , made on internal funding ? ; Or I mean , I know you 're applying for some DARPA funding . ; We have a little bit of DARPA . ; Oh , you already got some .
Bmr027_350	ar	Do we delete every meeting that they were in ? ; I don't think so . ; Well , then ; No .
Bmr028_1518	b	Mm - hmm . ; You have to be willing to jump to something that 's quite different . ; Mmm . ; Interesting .
Bmr019_1851	s	Mmm . ; Is , eh , a another acoustic event . ; Nice . ; We don't have background chewing .
Bro023_1334	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; What if you just look into the past ? ; It 's , uh , not as good .
Btr001_1153	bk	Hnh - nn . ; No . ; No . ; OK .
Bmr006_196	s	this is the worst case scenario . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group .
Bed013_117	s	just the fact that we 'll get The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ? ; It 's it 's uh ; Well , I 've I 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years . ; And so it 's it 's you 're right ,
Bed015_784	b	Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements . ; For instance , you Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements ; and that 's probably relevant for the like " where is " , you know , " the castle " kind of thing ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1540	b	So I I don't know if there There 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something ; so . ; I think that um What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_817	b	And at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer . ; Yeah , by fixing up transcripts . ; So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like . ; Yeah , but Yeah .
Bmr012_885	s	This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs ; Oh . ; Right . ; And it gets downsampled to sixteen .
Bro012_292	%	So . ; And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_839	b	And so it 's very , very similar . ; And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . ; Is this the project that 's sort of , uh , between , uh , NIST and and , uh , a couple of other places ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1429	b	Mm - hmm . ; and it it 's fifty steps , ; Mm - hmm . ; huh ?
Bed014_430	%--	No , no , no . ; It 's a Friday . ; No , w uh we 're talking about a week fr e end of next week . ; But , uh , but but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th
Bsr001_934	2	and they but they they do it somehow . They clean it up . ; Yeah . ; I notice that they they s they sa have some help with control of what person to pick up . ; Mixing ,
Bed005_1079	s	Then , this would be ; W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this , ; assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? ; So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then this would represent the probability distribution .
Bmr001_424	t1	That 's alright . ; Order of two . ; Cuz like , we don't Maybe we don't We don't need to save all channels , ; Factor of two .
Bro028_134	%--	Mmm . ; And . ; Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that , um ; Could ? Uh , uh ,
Bns002_1607	s	Now , please let don't switch off power , ; I have to call Adam , ; so ; So I suggest , @ @ now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break , tea , cake , whatever , @ @ will will be offered ,
Bed002_785	s	You 're gonna be in here , ; and somebody ; And and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . ; So you actually see that .
Bed003_994	s	But actually it had an interface . ; A lot of them were like , you know . ; Yep . ; Command line .
Bro024_1288	s	um , ; I don't know if we want to talk about that . ; But , ; well , the the " Car " noises are below like five hundred hertz .
Bed015_903	s	that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we talked about that a little bit this morning .
Bns001_1537	bk	And and have an intermediate project , which is related in this direction , something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever . ; This is a smaller portion in the gen more generic framework , I would like to say , from this proposal . ; Why not go in this way ? ; OK
Btr001_742	s	but . ; Of breath or of uh nothing ? ; No , of n just nothing . ; Just nothing ,
Bed017_478	s	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; um , s how to interpret . ; In in this case , infer in in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . ; We - we 've kind of talked about that ,
Bmr023_290	b	It should @ @ be finished today or something . Yeah . ; Well , I meant the overall thing . ; e e u u The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . ; Yeah .
Btr002_454	s	Yeah . ; see if I can do it just by itself , ; but it it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque , ; and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance
Btr001_1057	b	yeah . ; Yeah , that came up a couple of times , ; Yeah , I ; Yeah .
Bro018_271	aa	I don't I 'm not sure but I remember @ @ that I can't show that . ; OK , but that 's a That is a a good check point , ; you should do that anyway , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_783	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK , so if I , ; OK , included include ,
Bro024_471	b	So we 've got forty minutes left , ; and it seems like there 's a lot of material . ; An - any suggestions about where we where we should go next ? ; Mmm , @ @ .
Bmr018_803	aa	fr fr from the ; um , yeah , there 's a way to tell . ; It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people , ; Right .
Bro005_1253	aa	what was he doing , ; do you remember ? ; Sunil ? ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1677	s	Little bit of noise . ; Yeah . ; I use a threshold . ; If it 's below a particular value , it it flashes yellow .
Bro014_88	s	And but it runs much much faster . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , ; I I think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training ,
Bro018_691	qo	Oh . OK . ; So uh for example , this this uh feature set called the uh sound patterns of English um is just a bunch of um binary valued features . ; Let 's say , is this voicing , or is this not voicing , ; is this sonorants , not sonorants ,
Bmr007_1252	b	Notice how quiet I am . ; Sorry , ; and then the DARPA meeting I just excised completely , ; Yeah .
Btr002_2327	s	Yeah . ; And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off , ; even though maybe it 's several seconds later , there 's no glitch in the syntax or anything . ; It 's We 're pretty amazing machines .
Bro019_1271	%--	Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , ; and let the
Bed011_533	b	Uh for ten bucks , probably quite a few . ; Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2044	b	But but these other factors are fine . ; I just wanted to raise the issue . ; Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , uh , unintrusive as possi ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_543	s	Um , or also for dialogue of various sorts . ; Um , so it 's not a meeting . ; Right ? ; Because it 's two people and they 're not face to face .
Bns001_475	s	Yep . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; So , if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount , no problem at all .
Bro028_242	qw	for a second stream ? ; But , um , we we did a first try with this , ; and it it clearly hurts . ; But , uh , how was the stream combined ?
Bns003_433	b	but we we can do that . ; Or only the networking , uh , page . ; But the problem is , are you allowed to change anything on the general ICSI server ? ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2073	s	Yeah . ; Uh , the box , uh there 's a half inch lip here . ; The box is an inch thick ; so it hangs down a half an inch .
Bns001_283	s	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; too , like the the the Lucent , uh , equipment has a l huge scope already , ; like five hundred feet , or or even more sometimes . ; so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network .
Bmr019_496	s	but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike . ; Right . I understand that . ; I just meant that so you have three choices . ; There 's , um You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized .
Bro026_984	s	But , ; words aren't bad , yeah . ; And and ; Yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them ,
Bro025_665	s	Um . ; Yeah . So probably the VAD and and maybe testing out the noise estimation a little bit . ; I mean , keeping the same method ; but but , uh , seeing if you cou but , um noise estimation could be improved .
Bro023_1687	s	Uh ; Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some ; I just did something exactly the same as as the Ericsson proposal ; but , um , the probability of speech is not computed the same way .
Bmr020_927	s	So this training meeting , uh w un is that uh some data where we have uh very um , you know , accurate time marks ? for ; Great . ; I went back and hand - marked the ba the bins , ; I ment I mentioned that last week .
Bmr026_422	%	will it ? ; Right . ; On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . ; It 's
Bsr001_1982	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Yes . ; definitely .
Bed010_38	s	and " concept to speech " is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure ; so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags .
Bed017_371	s	And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , ; and um , I just hope that you have some comments ; or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , ; and and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you
Btr001_100	b	That 's not a bad strategy . ; I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage ; and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_657	s	Oh I see , OK . ; Just uh ; Yeah . ; So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization
Bmr019_305	s	Right . I saw that . ; And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script . ; So there 's this one script that parses waveform names ; and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , ID
Bed015_1249	b	like , what does that look like for an example ? ; Yeah . ; Like , not all of these things are gonna be here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1082	s	But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between , no . ; I 'm not a supporter of it . ; Huh - huh - huh . ; So they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ASCII bytes that can rescr refresh the screen with a different animation every , well , second , a few times .
Bed012_772	b	and ; That you will have in about nine months or so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_900	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer . ; Right .
Bed003_143	2	Mm - hmm . ; And be able to ; Mm - hmm . ; Appreciate it .
Bmr027_1186	b	Right . ; Yeah . If you need it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_897	%--	So , I mean , it 's ; When I add a couple more from that , uh that were done in my absence , I think that th we 'll be down to about there . ; So it 's not quite as close to half as I 'd thought , ; but it 's , you know
Bmr016_1718	bk	Hmm . ; So it 's not gloss . ; OK , I see . ; Yep .
Bro028_905	s	Uh And , um , ; the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much . ; And and , uh ; And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow .
Bro010_985	%--	So so ; Um . ; So , um , ; if you knew you were doing that ,
Bro019_488	bk	Uh . ; No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update . ; Ye ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_1519	s	cuz I think we might wanna go with that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; I wanna ask one question though .
Bmr014_731	s	and then that group would need it ; S It seems like i ; if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . ; So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy ,
Bmr010_1268	s	we have problem to with the with with the parameter ; with the representations of parameter , ; Yes . ; because the the valleys and the peaks in the signal , eh , look like , eh , it doesn't follow to the to the energy in the signal .
Bed015_896	aa	Uh k uh , at at the very least it constrai ; I think that 's that 's , th that 's certainly true . ; And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ? ; Oh , uh , for sure , yes .
Bmr016_2200	d	So , uh , have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already , have those been channelized ? ; Yes , they have . ; And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized , ; All ten hours ?
Bro018_908	s	Um ; At least I couldn't see any kind of control for that . ; Yeah , I don't think it 's in there , ; I think it 's in the uh uh uh the filters .
Bed006_1417	b	In my view . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because if we know that Enter is a t is an SPG action , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_4	t1	Test , um . Test , test , test . ; Guess that 's me . ; Yeah . OK . ; Ooh , Thursday .
Bmr024_766	b	OK . ; So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ? ; Yeah . ; Alright .
Bmr010_1400	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_65	s	So tha it has a single time - line , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then you can have lots of different sections , ; each of which have I Ds attached to it ,
Bns001_1553	s	I 'm focused on performance evaluation ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and um especially of communication networks
Bmr003_2614	bk	And so most of the time no one 's talking ; so it shortens it dramatically . ; But if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better . ; Yeah .
Bro010_198	bk	Yeah . ; So . ; Well . ; Yeah ,
Bro026_827	s	And then at some point it maybe be better to work together again . ; Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? ; I ; I mean , it 's to you .
Bmr028_1145	%--	S Yeah . ; Well , of course it was a bug . ; But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty f f It was pretty funny anyway . ; But still
Bmr015_990	bk	but but I 'm I 'm curious about it . ; Yeah . ; Um , uh , ; OK .
Buw001_1915	s	You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor ; Yeah , why search for them ? ; True . ; They 're we know where they are .
Bro005_1284	s	This is always hard . ; I mean I I I used to work with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh with a neural net system ; and uh , it was a common problem that you 'd ; Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets
Bmr002_1455	co	Yes . ; OK . ; Well , I don't mind . ; Oh , we should read some more numbers , then .
Bmr008_898	s	Yeah , ; Anyway . ; And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is " List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . " ; And that 's just and open - ended place for them to do .
Bed002_46	s	OK . ; Well , we can start doing it . ; Thanks . ; So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones .
Bed015_1068	s	I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that . ; And and these could actually just point to , you know , the the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? ; So , um , ; uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about .
Bed006_374	b	and so ; th the q first question for the subject is , " so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . ; Is there anything that interests you ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1118	t3	Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing , ; I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the ; yeah . ; That 's like the Conch .
Bmr005_1109	s	So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony , ; and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike . ; When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone ; and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .
Bmr009_113	b	doing casual looking and can get the sense , " Hey , there 's something there . " ; and then you can play around with the measures . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro010_584	s	Mm - hmm . ; And then you just use those mean values as being the the , uh uh signal - to - noise ratio in that band . ; But what is the ; it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency .
Bro017_588	s	Hmm . ; but it 's more or less ready . ; Yeah . ; Well , we have a document that explain a big part of the experiments ,
Bmr019_1536	s	Um ; I guess everybody knows about ; I mean , u um , Mari was asking was trying to come up with something like an agenda ; and we 're sort of fitting around people 's times a bit .
Bed009_496	s	But um the internal workings of of the ; whether you know there 're dialogue action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata . ; So that shouldn't really matter too much . ; I mean it does matter
Bro024_1119	s	So you have to take the whole the five . ; There should be five sheets . ; OK , ; I have four now
Bmr006_682	aa	It 's a real problem , a frequently problem uh , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Btr001_1546	b	not be as careful . ; I kinda miss it . ; Excellent . ; Uh - huh .
Bns001_662	s	Yeah . ; And within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider , ; not the internet backbone core . ; And you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine , in principle , the base station cluster control .
Bed002_558	b	Because how I describe um , t its location uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , " It 's half a mile away " or something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's a granularity factor , ; Yeah .
Bro014_688	b	and ? ; I have no idea , ; because the issue I brought up was with a very simple spectral subtraction approach , ; Mmm .
Bsr001_470	s	I mean th ; Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment ; but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad , ; It was pretty bad .
Bro013_794	b	but some people say " O " and ; Yeah I normally say " O " cuz it 's easier to say . ; Yeah it 's shorter . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_428	s	and then um , there 's a he she wants the uh , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , ; so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either " VOC " for vocalized , ; like cough or like laugh or whatever , ; " NONVOC " for door - slam ,
Bmr023_874	s	and it it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band ; and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better ; Mm - hmm . ; one way or the other .
Bro024_438	s	and so , ; some of the research issues involved in this are , um , one , what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify ? ; Um , another one is um , what what other types of structures in these multi - band graphical models should we consider in order to um , combine evidence from the sub - bands ? ; And , uh , the third one is how do we how do we merge all the , uh , information from the individual uh , multi - band classifiers to come up with word word recognition or or phone recognition things .
Bed002_780	bk	How exactly does the data collection work ? ; Do they have a map , ; and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? ; OK .
Bmr010_529	s	But , ; uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least . ; Right . ; I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not .
Bed014_262	aa	I did . ; Was it ? ; I I wa I was looking at it . ; Yeah .
Bed003_719	aa	So the " tourists " node should be um , very consistent with the context node . ; Right ? ; If you say that 's more their in general what their background is . ; Yeah ,
Bmr005_250	s	I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , ; but they did say ; You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified ; uh , " in any publication using the data . "
Bed009_775	s	So , um So there was a chunk parser in Verbmobil , that was one of the uh branchers . ; You know they d th I c ; There were these various uh , competing uh syntax modules . ; And I know one of them was a chunk parser
Bed005_526	s	uh , and with some examples ; So , this is the XML and this is sort of what it will look like later on , ; even though it you can't see it on on this resolution . ; And this is what it sort of is the the structure of Map requests ,
Bed008_1139	aap	Um for endpoint ? ; No it 's it 's sh ; EV - it 's the EVA . ; yeah , down here ,
Btr002_1741	%	I mean , I remember one where one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately , ; and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people , ; and he was like , " I I I I I I I I I " ; Oh !
Bmr018_877	s	Right . ; Hmm ! ; y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement , ; but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask .
Bmr028_359	%--	And , uh , we 'll see if we get any responses . ; I just did it . ; Very good . ; But it is
Bmr021_668	ft	Yeah , OK . Great . ; and I I just described him , well , what I did ; Yeah , OK . ; Great . Great . Thanks . Thanks .
Btr001_1960	%--	Mm - hmm . ; and people will have their opinions ; and , you know ; And then you can
Bed011_765	bk	And that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask . ; And ; And par yeah , and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out , then you ask . ; OK .
Bmr010_885	aa	Same thing . ; Same thing ? ; So train a phone in the neural net ? ; Yeah .
Bmr021_814	qw	So this is just combination at the utterance level . ; Um . ; At the utterance level , right . ; Why do you think the ICSI front - end is so much worse ?
Bro023_36	aa	easy to talk to , ; and , uh , very interested in everything . ; Really nice guy . ; Yeah ,
Bed014_1422	ba	Like th that 's the conclusion . OK . ; So , you your dance card is completely filled now ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Shoot .
Bmr027_1360	2	I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful . ; Uh , so I can grab stuff there . ; And if , uh if I have some questions I 'll ; When we remember to fill them out .
Btr002_2708	aa	Yes they do . ; Yeah , the shyer ones sometimes will laugh i with the breath - laugh . ; And you can see it . ; Right .
Bro028_1183	s	except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these uh , uh , what these sub - features are are are are showing you . ; And , um , the other difference is that , um , he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting , ; which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ? ; And whereas in in this case you 're saying " let 's just do it unconstrained " .
Bro012_421	s	Oh . Oh , I see . ; Yeah . ; If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent , ; five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference ,
Bed002_783	%--	OK . ; Imagine you 're the the subject . ; You 're gonna be in here , ; and somebody
Bsr001_1877	s	Mmm . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; and I 'm also interested in prosody , um , use you know , u used over person to person stuff
Bmr016_179	s	not as connected numbers . ; Right , and you can give an example ; Mm - hmm . ; like , you know , " six sixty - one would be read as six one " .
Bmr022_642	s	Because the bi the beeps were missing , by definition . ; Right . ; So do you get a score for each alignment ? ; So it might actually work .
Bed002_1101	%--	Yeah , I know him . ; But i ; Yeah . ; But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the
Bmr003_2527	aa	Oh , cool . ; And and it 's a a PCMCIA card , right ? ; OK . ; Yep .
Bmr019_213	s	did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they didn't include it , ; They didn't include it . ; they made them do it again . ; Whereas , I took out the ones that I noticed that were blatant that were correctable .
Bro027_1015	2	n Not of the ; But n th the , um , ; tandem features are u used as they are . ; Are not .
Bmr014_774	s	I agree that the consent forms were uh , I cons ; agree with what Adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them . ; I see . ; OK , well , if that 's what it said .
Bns002_405	2	OK . ; So if I send an RTS , and get back , um , a CTS , then he is allowed to send data , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; a CTS .
Bed003_1590	ba	And , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . ; So you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , ; And ; That 's terrible .
Bns003_809	s	and , um , ; on the other hand there are also uh , some students or ; well , ; at the moment it 's quite difficult to find students , eh , who are doing their master 's thesis and so on
Bed002_935	s	and she 's got you know , some background in in all this stuff . ; And is a linguist st ; and , so ; So . That 's So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .
Bro023_864	b	So with a bump around one kilohertz . ; So when y when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at a particular frequency bin ? ; i ; Uh - huh .
Bmr029_412	s	Mmm . Right . ; Right . ; OK . ; Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits .
Bed014_1391	b	You know , exponentially num num many parses . ; And so th the concern might be that not that it would totally fail , but that ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2458	bk	Yeah . ; The the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_259	2	On top of the VAD that they provide ? ; No . ; Just using either their VAD or our current VAD . ; Our way .
Bro027_584	co	No , I mean , the ; after the noise part , the forty the the other hundred and eighty ; Well , I mean , ; Wait a minute .
Bns003_723	s	we have , uh , other students are which are , uh , mmm people that has a grant ; and they are they are starting as , uh , researchers , ; aaa , but this is only connected to your own funding ; so if you if you have projects you can have , uh , people working with you .
Bmr001_101	s	Right . ; OK , so this is Morgan . ; I 'm going to read some numbers now . ; That 's my group .
Bro005_530	b	So . ; because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_833	s	Mm - hmm . ; Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount . ; Yeah . ; But , Then again , this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes .
Bed005_43	aa	So that 's easy . ; Um . ; So , is Is that make sense to everybody ? ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1006	no	in principle , maybe we could get rid of them , ; so maybe ; And I was ; I I don't know ,
Bro005_271	s	Yeah , that 's without the neural net ; and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . ; But she had said eighty - two . ; This is the w well , but this is without on - line normalization .
Bmr026_1226	b	Yeah . ; It 's negligible , OK . ; Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_94	b	so we are recording . ; Ah . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1959	s	No ? ; Synchronized digits . ; No . ; That 'd be good .
Bro004_778	%--	And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . ; So um Uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , ; for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , ; so the qu
Bed015_1654	s	And then , you know , so " he say " , and then you sort of do a role shift . ; And then you sign " I , this , that , and the other " . ; Uh - huh . ; And you know , " I did this " .
Bmr016_308	s	I mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . ; In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . ; So , there 's between , um ; Well if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups ,
Bmr008_1689	s	and you could put an estimate estimate , you know , a fuzzy start and end time . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That they 're much longer than I expected .
Bmr020_1075	b	Yeah . ; because if if you go much larger , you have a y you know , your your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less , um , precise , ; because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1561	bk	and what was the other one ? ; Mustard . ; Mustard . ; OK .
Bro003_1431	b	so I think that i if ; What 's what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way , ; so that , uh , once these all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_74	bk	Oh , OK . ; yeah . ; So you know what he 's doing . ; Alright .
Bed016_748	bd	But it 's it 's unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . ; So . ; Well , unless he was repairing it or something , ; but yeah .
Bmr015_520	%--	" MRM zero zero two " , things like that . ; Just so that they 're they 're all the same length . ; But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always ; as long as you have
Bed010_777	bk	Oh i it feels like your as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth ; and and you deal directly with it . ; I once I I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? ; Right , yeah yeah yeah .
Bmr001_251	s	I mean the um The the weird thing is that actually delay in some beam - forming is not is not the clever thing to do . ; Yeah . ; The the the underwater guys do this stuff which is different . ; And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible .
Bns002_1298	b	And that means your mouse , and and and ; Five bucks chip . ; Yeah , and and and whatever kind of of eh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have , is Bluetooth - based . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bro003_963	t3	I just don't understand . ; Well , th ; uh , ; I 'm just kidding .
Btr002_793	b	It might be useful to to talk about the interface for for a bit , ; So . ; in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1524	ar	e so you e the patches that you ; No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed . ; Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches . ; No . No .
Btr002_233	b	So , uh , let me be sure I understand . ; So , you 're saying s ; boy , it 's hard to ig uh , ignoi that ignore that word . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr008_730	bk	That 's true . ; Washington and stuff , yeah . ; yeah . ; That 's true .
Bed005_28	s	Um , fifty was our sort of our first ; OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , ; not necessarily by any means all students ; but we 'll s we 'll start with with that .
Btr002_1949	s	Oh wow . ; You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something . ; Oh n ; And they 're all like in they 're own r world or something
Bmr024_1153	b	Right . ; Which I 'm sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1611	co	take the ; uh uh ; if it 's if it 's voiced , include it , ; Just separate out from the from the normal things ,
Bed003_1227	s	Maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di ; if this ; and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse ; which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe .
Bro024_731	b	Not much in the well match and the medium match and TI - digits also right now . ; So this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bed010_331	b	And the other is the actual semantics . ; OK ? What all you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . ; So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_89	s	But sometimes it is not possible , this direct communication , because nodes , end uh source or and destination nodes are um are too far away . ; And in this case , it can be done , communication can be done , by uh using multi - hub routing . ; So ; an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination .
Bmr020_1089	b	Mm - hmm . ; I see . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1326	aa	Oh , really ? ; Oh . ; Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ? ; Yes ,
Bmr011_469	s	So . ; All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . ; OK . Well ; And , uh , it is related to ours .
Bro026_423	aa	Uh . ; Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , probably .
Bmr028_576	b	It 's it 's no more than six words . So Roughly . On average . ; Ah . ; So . Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro021_1306	co	right , ; it 's only ; it 's only one ; Wait a minute .
Bmr031_648	s	And , the t unfortunately the tabletop ones ; the six tabletop which we record all the time no matter how many people are there , uh , don't compress nearly as well ; because they 're almost always have signal on them . ; Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it .
Buw001_266	s	And and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking , ; the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . ; And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , ; um , I think they should be recorded instead of written
Bmr019_1784	ft	And , thank you very much . ; Have a good trip . ; Yeah . ; Thank you .
Bmr001_422	s	Is it two gig an hour ? ; I 'm off by an order of magni ; That 's alright . ; Order of two .
Bro023_82	bk	And compared to , um , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance ; but it was just a slight drop . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm !
Btr002_2785	t1	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Interesting . ; OK , well , let 's see ,
Bed015_1555	b	So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , ; Yeah . ; and this is where blends and all terribl ; Yeah .
Bmr028_271	ba	Um ; Just hacking Dan 's code and m stepping through it . ; But , I think it 's close . ; Great .
Bed008_1339	s	Right . ; Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight ; so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth ; so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four
Bro026_408	s	So you would you 're You 're thinking to put the , uh , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? ; Well , that 's a question . ; I mean , we were talking about that . ; It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise ,
Bro022_795	b	Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . ; And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want ; to find a ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1205	t1	Thanks . ; There we go . ; And actually I was ; cuz I got a wireless mike on .
Bed006_1559	b	You have class until two , ; right ? ; so if we don't want him if we don't want him to run over here ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_408	bk	OK . ; But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro023_1039	aa	I I just just have the final number here . ; Mm - hmm . ; So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bed006_791	%--	but uh we 'll hold the the ; Well in this case it will hold the I mean the the features I guess . ; I 'm not it 's hard for me to exactly s ; So basically that will store the the object that is w
Bmr025_518	2	You mentioned it , ; but I think you both said " no , you 'll just use text file " . ; yeah . Yeah . ; Text .
Bed003_1822	qw	So is this the official end of the meeting now ? ; Yep . ; Looks like it . ; So what 's " Economics , the fallacy " ?
Bmr002_1019	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , they have a ; I vaguely recall that they have a pages uh tools page somewhere , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_351	qw	OK . ; So the ; And and you can say " OK , ; but what is the what the benefit is ? "
Bro024_401	b	you know , ; I 'm not sure how many frames you need . ; But you take that many from the front and flip it around to a as the negative value . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr026_812	%--	Right . ; So , we cou ; Yeah . ; That 's the the the
Buw001_425	aa	So , I mean And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . ; You know , it 's like ; But you could always post - hoc label them . ; Right , right . Exactly .
Bed003_1074	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So theoretically you could edit that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1180	%--	or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I just sort of have a feeling
Bed005_680	%--	Or travel , specifically . ; So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ? ; No . ; I think I think the i the idea is that
Bed013_1249	s	The next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh ; I don't know , maybe we wanna observe the uh , um , uh the length of of the words used , and , or the prosody ; Mmm . ; and g a and t make conclusions about the user 's intelligence .
Bmr019_1124	%	Right . ; But how fast do they do the words within the spurt ? ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1136	bd	not " I want to go to a bakery . " ; Well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area . ; Right . ; And I 'm , yeah I 'm I 'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely ,
Bro016_1037	%--	Um . ; So , ; um . ; So , once wa
Bns001_1035	b	Ri - right now there is still a lot of WAP , actually . ; And ; So that the ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_679	%--	So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , ; and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . ; That 's ; I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say " here is a here is "
Bdb001_613	%--	So it 's it 's not hi it 's sort of bottom - up . ; And then each utterance could refer to a turn , ; and each turn could refer to something higher up . ; And what if you actually have
Btr002_917	s	I I should it depends on how much I wanna go back ; Yeah . ; and how certain the boundary is . ; If I can see it if it 's if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear ,
Bed011_1128	s	Good . ; Um , the action planner guy has wrote has written a a p lengthy proposal on how he wants to do the action planning . ; Good . ; And I responded to him , also rather lengthy , how he should do the action planning .
Bro028_1192	s	Um . ; Yeah , so so that 's the that 's the first part uh , one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories . ; Um , the other one was , um , to , uh , come up with a a a model um , a graphical model , that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables , latent variables , that we don't know anything about , ; but that through , um , s statistical training and the EM algorithm , um , at the end of the day , we have , um we have learned something about these these latent , um latent variables
Bro025_732	s	Just to see where where I could start off from , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , you know ? ; A a a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , uh , a better set .
Bmr018_406	s	right ? ; Not very quickly . ; The problem is that that the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms . ; You can but it takes time .
Bmr014_297	no	Right . ; OK . ; Uh , is Dave ; I don't know if Dave is on the list ,
Bmr026_312	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . ; So , we 're doing OK on backed up .
Bsr001_171	bk	what does " solo " mean ? ; Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine . ; Ah ! ; Oh .
Bmr009_834	aa	Oh dear . ; But I am put I am putting the beginning of the meeting . ; We 've been we 've been messing up your forms . ; I know .
Bmr012_536	s	and and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system ; and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . ; So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all . ; I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better
Bns003_549	b	Yep . ; So it 's just a su suggestion ; I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1037	b	Yes . ; Yes . ; so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were standard features . ; Yeah .
Bed005_712	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed ; because there is an ontology , ; and the database , and stuff .
Bmr019_1539	bk	and we 're sort of fitting around people 's times a bit . ; But , um , clearly when we actually get here we 'll move things around this , as we need to , ; but ; OK .
Btr002_1963	ba	and just sort of stuff like that . ; It was just really bizarre . ; So . ; That 's really funny .
Bro014_1173	b	Oh , yeah . ; This is ; but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation ; Right .
Bed014_1001	s	but I think that 's I mean . ; That should be relatively flexible be ; pretty flexible , I think . ; Yeah . There 's just sort of the two to four of us .
Bed006_1353	qw	I mean does th ; Who uses this uh this data structure ? ; You know ? Like , do you say " alright I 'm going to uh do an SPG action " . ; And then you know somebody ne either the computer or the user says " alright , well , I know I want to do a Source - Path - Goal action so what are my choices among that ? "
Bmr025_840	aa	Well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , ; we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . ; I mean , ; Right .
Bmr028_517	bk	Right . ; Yeah . None of the e emails bounced , so I know they 're going somewhere . ; Good . OK . ; Right .
Bmr019_535	bk	f ; Well ; OK . ; Oh , OK .
Bro012_760	ba	And um the preliminary results were very bad . ; So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization . ; Uh - huh . ; And it hurts uh a lot .
Bro008_320	%--	And which is a s a s a simpler problem , perhaps , but which is perhaps important for noisy speech . ; The other thing that strikes me , just looking at these numbers is , just taking the best cases , ; I mean , some of these , of course , even with all of our our wonderful processing , still are horrible kinds of numbers . ; But just take the best case , the well - matched uh , German case after er well - matched Danish after we
Buw001_1039	s	Maybe e Is email easier ? ; I mean , I when you first said do do it , um , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up ; Mm - hmm . ; and you have to hook them up to the recorder .
Bed015_565	bd	And then how they interact with some extra thing like " in France " or " if such - and - such " , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can ; Yeah . ; You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you . ; I think .
Bed015_1875	s	Right . ; No , no . ; Anyway , so so , um , I guess ; uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that ,
Bro025_225	s	So , um , all of that is is , uh still seems like a good idea . ; The thing is now we know some other constraints . ; We can't have unlimited amounts of latency . ; Uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe
Bmr014_179	bk	So we 're not increasing the number of channels . ; No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr020_1034	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop . ; Now sometimes you know , it 's these are involved in places where there was no time .
Bro010_653	s	if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean , imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum ,
Btr001_659	b	it seems like it 's it 's related to this production idea . ; How you you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way , ; but . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1003	ba	and ; Right . ; I mean , i the ; Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other
Bro024_650	s	But the the only number that 's still I mean , which Stephane also got in his result was that medium mismatch of the Finnish , ; which is very which is a very strange situation where we used the we changed the proto for initializing the HMM ; I mean , this this is basically because it gets stuck in some local minimum in the training . ; That seventy - five point seven nine in the Finnish mismatch which is that the eleven point nine six what we see .
Bmr016_2085	s	but somehow percent is not so hard , you know ? ; Hmm . ; i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are ; And we could always add it later .
Btr002_2525	qw	Mm - hmm . ; W what about pre transcribing it , um , " HMPH " ? ; But it th it 's true that th segments are different too . ; What about transcribing it that way ,
Buw001_2143	s	Yeah , I am . ; Yeah . ; So , I w uh , just just for clarification . ; So " found data " ,
Bmr031_688	s	So . ; Good . ; But I I think it 's probably we should start thinking about where to go next , ; especially on the backed - up disk space .
Bed015_655	cc	Right , OK . ; but they I mean uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way . ; And ; Well , I 'll check .
Bed012_337	%--	and ; this like that ; and maybe here also some ; You should probably make them out of
Bro012_1209	s	ei either way , ; it 's more or less the same . ; But uh the thing is that um you then can get rid of things that are not ; i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic .
Bmr024_203	ba	huh . ; and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits . ; Yeah . ; That 'd be great .
Bns001_853	s	But not any application . ; And we also have the aspects for security . ; Miguel , you mentioned here authentication and and triple - A , ; but we do not have any expert anymore .
Bed010_1099	b	right ? ; So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done . ; Right . ; Mmm .
Bed008_663	aa	User schedule . ; Schedule ? ; " Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome or do I just have to " " time to take a picture of the outside ? " ; Right .
Bmr022_427	x	perhaps just the speaker ID or something . ; Just say speaker one or spea ; or just one , two , three , four for four speakers or something . ; Pppt !
Btr001_1058	b	Yeah , that came up a couple of times , ; Yeah , I ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Buw001_1647	s	But I think all he would want is the digits . ; Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . ; I 'm interested in getting the language model data . ; Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions .
Bmr010_77	%--	I think that would be a good thing to start with . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Um , and , um , the other thing , uh ,
Bmr002_843	aa	But that kind of thing I think we would probably want to extract automatically . ; And then I 'll be ; I mean , e this is , the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_537	b	So he talks about the woman being " two - derful " , ; and ; and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_10	s	Um , sort of , I do , peripherally . ; Um Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago ; Is that English ? ; That 's our system .
Btr001_366	b	and then they 'd pronounce it in English ; Yeah . ; and so I could figure out what it was ; Yeah .
Bro004_1057	ar	It 's on training . ; Training , with the training test of each ; You understand me ? ; No .
Bro008_444	s	Uh , and you had , you know , you had the multi - band things also , and , you know , there was issue of that . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well .
Bed015_264	s	Yeah yeah . ; And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . ; Right . ; So that 's a useful thing
Bmr025_669	s	but it 's solved . ; So . ; Does and that does that mean , I ; maybe I should know this but I don't .
Bed012_650	b	Cuz I thought it was like , that one in Stuart 's book about , you know , the ; Alarm in the dog ? ; U Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1815	aa	Exactly . ; Whereas , you know , if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted , ; we 'd get no cues . ; Yep .
Bro007_270	b	Yeah . ; right . ; So these these are word error rates ; Yeah .
Bed003_1270	s	So e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . ; It 's going to get very ugly . ; But with this way we could say " OK , these are the discourse phenomena . ; They ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .
Bro007_600	s	so in some ways he just got his payback , ; but uh again I I don't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group ; Mm - hmm . ; but but if if we are that 's an offer .
Btr001_2162	%--	I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn . ; Oh , yeah . ; I mean , it 's ; It didn't sound stran
Bmr027_182	bd	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , exactly . Yeah . ; I didn't mean to isolate them .
Bro014_926	s	I mean , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all . ; So another way of looking at it is that um , the mel cepstru mel spectrum , mel cepstrum , any of these variants , um , give you the smooth spectrum . ; It 's the spectral envelope . ; By going back to the FFT , you 're getting something that is more like the raw data .
Bmr010_671	s	I mean , I had thought about this before . ; I mean , when when when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on . ; Oh . ; But I felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it
Buw001_186	b	I mean , the box that contains the ; Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . ; There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_592	s	Yep . ; Good . ; I mean , you know , basically he 's he just studies , he 's a colleague , ; a friend ,
Bed008_1520	bk	Cuz ; OK . ; Yeah yeah . ; OK .
Bns002_1245	s	And uh Bluetooth is mainly for cutting this cable . ; You know , the other day I was joking about that our wireless microphones were not , in fact , wireless ; because it had this wire , ; So , the point is that eh Bluetooth is mainly a technology for cutting these kind of cables .
Bed009_196	s	And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment . ; And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project ; and we noticed that first of all what are ; I should 've brought some slides ,
Bed002_592	bk	Nuh . ; History . ; Discourse history . ; OK .
Bro027_1954	b	Yeah . ; It 's running ; it shou we should have the results today during the afternoon , ; Hmm .
Bmr016_748	bk	So let 's do that off - line , ; we don't need to do it during the meeting . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed011_511	s	yeah ; th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah . ; OK . ; But this is open .
Bro005_885	s	in fact , ; yeah . ; Um , the third The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps ; but , well , this is not clear yet
Bmr005_334	s	eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech ; Nonspeech sounds ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail .
Bmr007_1004	aa	Yeah . ; um If you model the the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else 's microphone , as well as on that , and you build , um ; basically I think you 'd you would build a an HMM that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations ; All the Yep .
Bro026_256	s	downsample , ; DCT , ; DCT , ; then , um , on - line normalization ,
Bmr010_1234	s	That 's fine . ; I 'm finished . ; eh , was p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits ; and and I haven't heard , uh , from Jose yet .
Bro023_1595	bk	but with just the Wiener filtering from their system . ; Right ? ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bro003_505	b	Ah , but which Dan ? ; Uh , Ellis . ; OK . ; Right ?
Bed010_851	s	So we 've talked about it , ; and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing , ; OK . ; and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .
Bed002_1319	bk	OK . Sounds good . ; The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone . ; I was wondering . ; OK .
Bed009_815	aa	Yeah I guess it 's similar . ; yeah ; that 's In this direction , ; yes
Bmr002_1125	b	Right . ; I Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs , ; listened to them in stereo . ; Huh .
Bsr001_2393	b	yeah , ; yeah , ; yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro005_1402	b	" Swede . " ; Yeah . ; So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there . ; Mmm .
Bed009_1086	%--	and map it onto the current context to find out what the person really was talking about in that context . ; Well that 's that 's that 's where the belief - net comes in . ; or or a ; So th the idea is ,
Bro013_651	s	Um our t I went to talk with uh Mike Jordan this this week ; Mm - hmm . ; um and uh shared with him the ideas about um extending the Larry Saul work ; and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M
Bns003_879	s	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Yeah , ; so what I mean is at a certain degree , yeah , that has to be figured out .
Bmr031_1394	s	So we might want to look into that . ; Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . ; Right . ; But I mean , that th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that .
Bed002_638	%--	I guess ; could you back to the slide , ; the previous one ? ; So , is it that it 's , um
Bro008_525	b	I don't know if we can get some hand - labeled data from other languages . ; Yeah . ; It 's not so easy to find . ; Right .
Btr002_521	s	Yeah . ; I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think ; who was telling me ? ; Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um , in , um , airports .
Bro027_1167	b	But , I 'm saying , there could be some some issues of ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1101	bk	With ; With what ? ; With what ? ; Right . Mixed .
Bro027_1370	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , I 've been wondering about something . ; In the , um a lot of the , um the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA .
Buw001_713	s	and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . ; Right . ; So we 're gonna ; So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do ,
Bed006_1141	b	Sure it ; OK . ; but yeah I mean like ; Yeah .
Bmr028_9	bk	although I don't remember them . ; You only sent me one thing , which was demo status . ; And asking which one we were on this week . ; Right .
Bed008_531	b	so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions , ; so let 's make a new node ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_147	s	OK . ; And we were puzzled . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , the reason was that the parser i c completely ignores the verb .
Bmr005_172	s	and So who is " he " in this context ? ; Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun ; OK . ; So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .
Bro024_357	aa	we 're getting a little off track here . ; Oh , ; r But but but ; right .
Btr001_745	aa	Just nothing , ; Yeah . ; Hmm , yeah . ; yeah .
Bmr001_674	s	Exactly exactly . ; I think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this . ; And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough , um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well . ; Yeah , I mean that 's the thing .
Bmr015_67	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; I could always say something about transcription . ; I 've been but but uh , well
Bro005_1096	b	Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we have we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; Mmm .
Bed002_159	s	So , we 're we 're working with SRI , ; with UW , ; Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . ; We 're not including video , obviously .
Bmr010_610	%--	Yeah . ; Did something happen , Morgan , that he got put on this , or was he already on it , ; Add him . ; or ?
Bmr007_763	s	I mean the the how a person is sitting is ; But if you just ; Yeah . ; f But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that .
Bed012_295	t3	Did you just sti Did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea ? ; No . ; And , um , ; I 'm not drinking tea .
Bmr001_290	b	Someone might . ; Oh that 's uh ; I was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake PDA right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_273	%--	Correcting . ; We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections . ; And I you know , I 've also d uh , discovered ; So with the new transcriber I 'm
Bmr022_1431	s	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes , ; cuz it 's real easy when you 're trying to , I don't know , run alignments and there 's a word you wanna fix , to go in and do that and then mess up other things , ; if you don't know , you know , the overall philosophy behind the the conventions .
Bro005_1344	s	Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem . ; So . ; Mmm . ; So , there 'll still be plenty to do .
Bro004_787	%--	and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . ; Right . ; And uh binary decisions about phonemes . ; Nnn Uh It 's
Bro018_348	no	Well , this is natural log , ; and maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is ; Is that some kind of base conversion , ; I I have no idea .
Bro014_768	co	it 's in ; But what you 're saying is that when you do these ; Yes . Uh ; So let me try to understand .
Bro003_417	%--	I think ; I don't know anything about Finnish . ; well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family . ; But they 're just these , you know , uh countries that are pretty far apart from one another , have I guess , people rode in on horses and brought their
Bmr018_464	b	The problem is if if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up ; So . ; Isn't that ; Right .
Bro004_345	%--	I have a suggestion , actually , ; even though it 'll delay us slightly , ; would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? ; Cuz we 're all sort of
Bmr014_96	s	and and ; But um , we could try anyway , ; Right . ; uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting ,
Bro012_1303	s	and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different ; as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based ; Mm - hmm . ; uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one ,
Bed014_661	b	Yeah . ; But I do th think that the It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override . ; Yeah , I mean , if if you ask " how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost ? " and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say " OK How much is , uh I would like to visit the " whatever , something completely different , " then I go to , you know , Point Reyes " , ; Yeah .
Bro019_664	s	um , I guess what will happen ; I don't know what will happen . ; But , the different contribution , I think , for the different test set will be more even . ; Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet
Bmr011_1353	bd	Yeah , I guess you you can try ; you know , like government people , ; but ; I don't know .
Bmr029_582	h	Uh , not to mention that that , uh , Mari 's putting together this report next week , too , you know . ; So Uh , ; what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do , uh , the , um , calculation on the training set ; and , uh
Bmr030_390	s	There 's there 's several problems . ; One is , um , we were giving them these large files , ; Fff ! ; which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes .
Bmr031_1491	b	So . ; OK . Yeah . Cuz this will be , like , after ; Yeah , cuz you have this AS - ASRU deadline . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro026_995	b	But but but we 're not trying for models of words here . ; See , so her here 's maybe where ; If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1127	%--	um , ; i let 's assume we we call something like a loc - X node and a path - X node . ; And what we actually get if we just look at the discourse , " where is X " should activate ; or should
Bmr027_284	s	And , um , then ; We did that , I I believe . ; Right . ; So . A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement .
Bsr001_1478	aa	How is that ? ; Three peop total ? ; We 're gonna start with just three people , ; yeah .
Bns002_1026	s	and , eh the other the other set of protocols are using a reactive uh approach ; and these protocols are trying to work on demand , ; so they are trying to solve on only these routers that are needed ; so when I want to send uh , a packet to a a given destination , first of all , I have to figure out the proper route for this packet .
Bmr011_124	%--	Right , ; so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is is c correct . ; Yeah . ; Is
Btr002_197	b	Do you wanna ; Actually , that comes back to a point . ; We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in " so " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1649	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; right ? ; You 're not intending to do any
Bed005_1129	s	Right . ; And , um In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , um , manually , uh , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ? ; Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent ; I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take
Bed009_1120	b	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that , ; Yeah ,
Bro003_1425	s	Yeah . ; So it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out . ; And then , um , if if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line ; and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less .
Bro025_177	s	So will the neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? ; Well , so so so argu arguably , I mean , what we should do ; Or will it operate on the original ? ; I mean , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on .
Bmr025_534	aa	Yeah . ; Right . ; you actually have to say which one . ; I know
Bsr001_626	b	Mm - hmm . ; which , as you said , you know , is your interaction with the PDA in your case , ; where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1189	b	then aligns things , ; and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad . ; Oh , excellent . ; OK .
Buw001_459	b	because that that 's a lot of trouble ; Mm - hmm . ; and maybe it 's not the best way to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_491	s	Nice walls ? ; Wi ; Oh . ; " Nice walls " is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge .
Bmr011_1809	s	Mm - hmm . ; and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . ; Is that right ? ; Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker ,
Bed003_297	ar	Well i it 's ; From the utterance ? ; Hmm . ; Actually , no ,
Bns001_1109	s	But usually that 's not the reason to have UMTS . ; No , not not if you have a big uh web pad or something . ; Yep . ; Then you m There there 's an IP stack in it
Bmr010_1494	b	By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe , ; but ; by your friends , ; Yeah .
Bro015_107	aa	And and and trying to collate results ? ; and get something from it ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed003_868	%--	Um - And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth , ; so . ; But , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say . ; But . Um . So s So if you are a d
Bmr011_806	s	and what we what we will do and uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting ; for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . ; And they do have some sort of software , ; at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS
Bmr011_222	qh	What can I say . ; And then , ; So does the recognizer . ; Oh , really ?
Bro014_1145	bk	Yeah . ; and that 's that should be flat for ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed014_858	s	Right . Anyway , uh . So . ; Really ? ; But , yeah , a second that would be great . ; So , uh , a sec I mean you 're gonna need it anyway .
Bro024_647	s	So all the hi H M numbers are w very good , ; in the sense , they are better than what the French Telecom gets . ; So . ; But the the only number that 's still I mean , which Stephane also got in his result was that medium mismatch of the Finnish ,
Bro003_498	qrr	Mmm . ; Were the digits , um , hand - labeled for phones ? ; Um , the the digits ; Or were they those labels automatically derived ?
Bmr030_242	s	Oh . OK . ; And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound . ; Mm - hmm . ; Play the audio corresponding to that , um , um , feature file ,
Bmr027_438	aa	OK . ; Yeah . We never really talked about that . ; Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_517	b	Hmm . ; And the other one didn't . ; And on this side , this one 's picking up things like " neural nets " and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't . ; Right .
Bmr003_737	ar	The timing should be ; But we don't care about the timing of the words . ; Well I thought you just that 's said that was a critical issue . ; No ,
Bmr028_1290	b	You can ; Yeah . ; So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file , it will actually compare the words based on their time marks . ; Right .
Bed012_660	s	Maybe . ; But there 's something about bowel problems or something with the dog . ; Yeah . ; And we have all the top ones ,
Bed011_539	s	Do do people think that , you know this is is gonna um cover what we need , or should we be thinking about more ? ; Okay , in terms of decision nodes ? ; Yep . ; I mean , Go - there is is a yes or no .
Bro003_167	s	downsampled to eight kilohertz ; and I 've added noise to one part , with the actually the Aurora - two noises . ; And , @ @ so this is a training part . ; And then the remaining part , I use for testing and with other kind of noises .
Bro016_930	bk	and ; and then just add some kind of on - line normalization in in the neural network . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bmr005_346	b	So it was ; Yeah . ; I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily or , you know , something like that , it 'd be it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_290	b	Yeah . ; So , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line , ; So how do you ; Yeah .
Bmr002_819	s	is um a query language for research in phonetics where he wants to build in ToBI tags ; and so you can determine ; um I wanted to mention this to you . ; I was going to come by and ask you about this .
Bmr008_268	t1	Yeah . ; Right . ; Then it 'd be fine . ; I think it 's fine .
Bed017_210	s	and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . ; So . ; Anything else I missed ? ; So that was pretty quick .
Bmr013_693	s	Yeah sure . ; They might be OK . ; OK . ; It you know it really depends on a lot of things ,
Bro010_302	s	I mean , it might even be too abrupt . ; You might have to put in a s a s a delay . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it may feel different than talking to a person
Btr001_2252	bk	When you end the utterance . ; When ; When you say something ; Oh , just just ending with " so " .
Bmr009_470	s	But all the other cases might . ; and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or ; e e and and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log , ; I mean , just listen to it .
Btr002_147	bk	OK , so it should have been " the quals w the the quals slides will be fine " . ; This is Jerry Feldman . ; And , uh , instead it was transcribed with " the " and then an uncertain syllable " the the " and then " all the slides will be fine " . ; Ah .
Bed015_942	s	yeah , ; go ahead , ; finish . ; and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that .
Bed015_945	s	and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . ; But it 's still is limited possibility . ; Hmm . ; So that should , you know , interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there .
Bmr019_943	b	and I was able to you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications ; Well , I know there were some speaker labelling problems , um , after interruptions . ; which were changes . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_8	x	OK , agenda items , ; Uh , we have digits , ; What else we got ? ; New version of the presegmentation .
Bmr016_2181	s	Yeah . ; That 'd be excellent . ; Yeah , that 'd be really great . ; As it stands we 're still in the phase of sort of , um , cleaning up the existing data
Bro010_359	br	and to to change the contextual KLT for LDA . ; Change the what ? ; The contextual KLT . ; I 'm missing that last word .
Bro012_1424	%	it was probably Resource Management or something , ; um , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall . ; And um , so um ; Another person 's voice .
Bro021_1080	s	Now we can put this . ; Yeah . ; No ? ; And here we can multiply by X .
Bed005_1144	g	because G is a function from that to that . ; Yep . ; Right . ; Right ?
Bmr016_1153	s	So for things like " and " , the fact that someone doesn't say the " D " , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription ; because a a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . ; However , things like " cuz " where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , ; and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language ,
Bmr029_805	s	Well , I guess it 'll dep ; you 'll you 'll we 'll need to get the segmentations . ; Yeah . ; Figure out whether we 're using the new or the old from Don .
Bed002_1210	g	Pppt ! ; Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . ; Even if it 's really crude . ; OK ?
Bns002_1440	%--	so as it is described in the uh project proposal . ; Um the point is that um to start with um a bigger cluster of co uh of potential partners to do this really really really big work , ; seems not to be feasible in the next time . ; because if you have settled everything , and discussed everything and and and and uh without any money in the background , and a lot of money in the background ,
Bmr030_46	bk	Not great . ; So , d was that the one that was the meeting maps ? ; Yeah . ; OK , good .
Bmr020_1341	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and that is if we go ahead and we just run his , and we generate the beeps file , then we have somebody listen beeps file . ; Yeah .
Bed008_982	%--	Sh - Should we just make some ; Sure , if you want . ; um ; if there 's parking maybe
Bro016_1116	s	Mm - hmm . ; What ? ; And then that you know , that may map to this phone sometimes , ; and sometimes it may not .
Bmr020_375	ba	although of course , some error is gonna be in there . ; But basically what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost uh , the level of the non - overlapped speech . ; So that means that even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , uh , the recognizer does a good job , ; That 's great .
Bmr002_375	s	I see . ; However , if we have a transcribing machine I would accept it . ; The other thing is , you know , having getting hold of a transcriber . ; I think that CogSci has one .
Bro017_1182	bk	I don't think so . ; No . ; No . ; OK .
Bro005_1167	s	but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases ; and uh the performance is getting worse ; and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better . ; And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that .
Bmr019_1062	s	Mm - hmm . ; So that 's good news , really . ; even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting , ; but we 'll find out anyway .
Bed016_351	s	and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , ; so that ; Mm - hmm . ; and that we 're planning to do this ,
Bmr007_635	b	You 've been working on that . ; right ? ; Right , I mean Adam was ; Yeah .
Bns003_925	s	so that everybody can see and everybody knows , yeah , I have in mind ; maybe it 's a small NSA group activity itself , with no linkage to the outer world ; maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home ; there 's some linkage
Bro023_98	s	So I w bef before , um Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . ; In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . ; And , um , ; here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds
Btr002_2703	ba	Ex - exactly . Exactly . ; Yeah . ; A lot of people go , ; Well done .
Bmr006_1030	b	But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . ; because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_496	s	Yeah , this one 's fine . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Right . ; and I get a little bit of peripheral vision ,
Bmr003_1717	%--	And then , uh , let 's see what else . ; Oh , yes , ; I I wanted to have ; So sometimes a pers I uh
Bmr013_80	b	Yeah , OK . ; There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . ; Good . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_753	b	Yes . ; I also ; If someone feels strongly enough about it , then I I I think they should be allowed to do that . ; mm - hmm .
Bed015_515	s	There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place . ; Good . ; And ; you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place ,
Bro018_893	x	Yeah ; no and I didn't have a chance to do that . ; Ha ! ; Oh !
Bmr028_36	s	First of all , I did a little thing for Liz with the Transcriber tool , that , um first of all , it uses the forced alignments , ; so that the words appear , uh , in their own segments , rather than in long in long chunks . ; Oh . ; She said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she 's working on .
Bmr014_478	b	Mm - hmm . ; it 's not a good way of saying ; but it 's it 's the specific uh way of stating these these letters . ; Right .
Bmr002_874	qh	And , ; Is it the French one ? ; uh , let 's see , ; where did I get this ?
Btr002_3292	%--	It s takes an extra step . ; Glad it 's useful . ; OK , now I just have one more thing to say ; and that is that ,
Bro007_224	h	What are what are the sizes of any of these sets , ; I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . ; So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ? ; Uh
Btr001_1796	%--	Do you find ; you 've ; i This has caused me to wonder . ; So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've where they have like " dot dot 's " cuz it 's segments they didn't hear , that that you add u
Bed014_1292	b	so it 's ; which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr015_350	b	No . ; It 's just from his message it sounded like that . ; Just just th ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed006_1810	s	Yeah . ; I mean , y ; Mm - hmm . ; The the the representational problems are I 'm sure , will be there ,
Bmr013_877	s	but that 's OK . ; And then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers . ; So if they say one - eighty - three versus one eight three . ; Um , and also I 'll be , um , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material .
Bed006_1463	s	I mean , just beca cuz I 'm new ; and I don't really just I just don't know what to make of this ; Mm - hmm . ; and what this is for , and stuff like that , you know ,
Bed016_710	s	Mm - hmm . ; So " in the bus " and " on the bus , " ; um , that 's actually a little tricky in English ; because to some extent they 're synonyms .
Bed017_778	s	right ? ; Absolutely . Yeah . ; Yeah . OK . ; But um , and hopefully all sidetracking um , other things will have disappeared , soon .
Bmr016_523	aa	Oh , oh ! ; yeah . ; Nein . ; That 's right !
Bro004_422	ar	Training on a single language , you mean , ; and testing on the other one ? ; Yeah . ; Not yet .
Bmr003_1807	aa	Is it ; But I think for a first try that 's about right . ; So so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's ; That 's right .
Bmr020_897	aa	Yeah . ; Ah ! ; Clever . ; Yes .
Bed014_654	%--	Uh , tal so I 'm talking about shopping ; and then you say , uh , you know , well , um " What 's it cost ? " or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or
Bed003_1028	s	Nope . ; Just s l start up a new DOS . ; We - That 's alright . ; I can probably double cli click on it .
Bro013_636	b	But as you say it 's not that smooth here . ; And and so if you if you just you know subtracted off uh your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so ; and and our first kilohertz , even . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_660	%--	So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment , ; " Dine out " is ; Socializing , I guess . ; No , I I
Bed008_71	b	right ; for each down here . ; When we 're yeah when we 're done . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_777	2	Yeah . The error changed by probably one percent or so . ; But , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a ; OK . So that ; So that 's So that 's not the problem .
Bro026_848	s	right ? ; the most common phonemes . ; And each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window . ; And it has has these patterns .
Bro010_1033	%--	but that 's very similar to sonorance . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w
Bmr030_43	ba	And to do research on the meetings . ; Cool . ; Yeah , it was specifically on the meeting . ; Not great .
Btr002_1565	ba	If there was pie again , ; That 's right . ; if there was those tarts again , I 'd be like , " Set us some aside some there . " ; Ooh , those were good .
Bmr024_776	%--	OK . ; Well , I didn't realize that . ; Good point . ; That 's that 's a
Bro004_139	%--	W which in ; It has three languages . ; That 's including the w the the ; This includes
Bmr022_247	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But yo I guess you 'd still get the mistake that you mentioned , ; because the person
Bmr022_83	b	Wasn't that what you said ? ; Sort of a text template , ; but I don't know how we can do that . ; Uh - huh .
Bro024_1672	s	But the way it 's done is that um , for low gain , there is this non nonlinear smoothing actually . ; For low gains um , I use the smoothed sm uh , smoothed version ; Uh . ; but for high gain @ @ it 's I don't smooth .
Bmr014_634	s	That 's that 's basically the the the thing . ; OK . ; Yeah , and I and I tried t to normalize uh uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , ; because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .
Bro008_257	s	So ; so , it seems like the main different there is the is the , uh , filtering . ; And the filtering I think if you can ; shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part .
Bmr013_384	s	So it 's like a continuum . ; Right . ; Right . ; It 's you 're going all the way down ,
Bed002_925	bk	Is she an undergradua ; She 's graduated . ; She is a graduate , OK . ; Yeah .
Bro011_144	s	and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you ; and they were sort of waiting for you ; and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , ; and they just had hadn't thought of that .
Bns002_1590	s	As you take a look to the the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and and all those things . ; And you have the GPS tunnel p uh protocol G T P between the G and the S and the GTSN . ; And and so on . ; So uh I believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh between the um um involved nodes ,
Bed004_756	s	Uh . ; then . ; Yeah . ; I confess , I 'm still not completely comfortable with the overall story .
Bed005_942	%--	And I I don't pretend to understand yet what I think we really ought to do . ; OK . ; So , e enough of that , ; but I , uh , um ,
Bmr014_586	b	and I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer ; Oh , I see . ; as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever , ; Right .
Bro028_218	%	Cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a good point . ; Mmm .
Bro027_62	qw	So the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred ; but . ; and hundred and hundred hundred and maybe it 's like fi hundred hertz . ; But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ?
Bsr001_965	%	Oh , I 'm sure they do . ; They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back . ; They ; They will do , a bit .
Bmr007_1232	b	Yeah , I agree . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns001_928	%--	You you neglected that , ; but I don't think that you are right in that sense . ; Well , think it works , ; but uh
Bmr028_288	s	So ; OK . ; Yeah . So I think for the L stuff Liz was talking about , we have something that 'll work now . ; And Liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else .
Bmr022_781	bk	so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences . ; You know , there are so many things about this that are non - uniform that I think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing , ; but you 're just not going to I mean we 've ; OK .
Bmr010_533	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . What what are the different , uh , classes to to code , uh , the the overlap , you will use ? ; Um , to code d
Bmr023_1252	no	Uh , O 's or zeroes , ; we wanna agree on that ? ; Maybe just whatever people would naturally do ? ; I don't know .
Btr001_2219	aa	Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; kind of , ; yeah , yeah .
Bro027_1480	s	Yeah . ; Exactly . ; I mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system , ; and , um , Andreas and I talked about it ,
Bmr003_1243	ba	That 's why Dave should have been here . ; To pr protect his people . ; Well , I would like you to do it ; Oh , cool .
Bed008_340	2	If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Drunk .
Bed005_386	cc	Yep . ; That 's just a specification for the XML format . ; Yep . ; Well , we 'll find that out .
Bmr013_79	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK . ; There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . ; Good .
Bmr016_213	qy	Well let 's give it a try . ; And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns ; Let 's try it . ; isn't that right , Liz ?
Bro012_892	%--	voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither . ; But after you do this , after you do the variance normalization ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean .
Bro003_1142	%--	it 's ; Right . ; yeah . ; So if you do have lots of combinations , it 's
Bmr003_1956	aa	No , it it it 's obviously true that he hasn't found any he likes . ; Right . ; The question is what is what 's he looked at . ; That 's true .
Bmr020_1685	b	No . ; Right . ; That won't be good . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_596	s	right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped . ; Um , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then ; Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . To push it along . ; See the problem is it it took , uh , uh , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes .
Bro012_838	s	Yeah . ; So if there 's an overall reason ; You know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing ; and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light
Bro014_1120	bk	So what 's th uh , what 's the intuition behind this kind of a thing ? ; I I don't know really know the signal - processing well enough to understand what what is that doing . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1331	b	Right . ; So . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_353	s	Yeah . ; Then the other issue related to that is data release . ; If we wanna show this in public , it should be releas ; So , I , uh , haven't gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval .
Bsr001_2008	bk	What ? ; One one thing we do know is that we 're we 're all producing NIST Sphere files in in , uh , eh in the standard format . ; Yeah . ; Oh ,
Bmr023_420	%--	I mean , you can compare , do a diff on the ; just so that we knew ; You could do it . ; It 's it 's complicated in that um , hhh , i hhh , i
Bmr012_479	b	I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News ; but with a little less weight ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro014_755	s	Yeah . ; Mainly because of the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD . ; OK . ; And then I took this system and , mmm , w uh , I p we put the old filters also .
Bro027_1769	ar	I mean , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously , ; but it 's @ @ ; But I mean I mean , train the net only on ; Well , no ,
Btr002_882	b	Mm - hmm . ; And I usually just use the mouse . ; How do you do that with the keyboard ? ; Mmm .
Bmr024_1487	b	But , this for making things worse . ; This it migh ; Th - the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a comple used a different feature set , that ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_254	ba	Yep . ; Yeah she she didn't explicitly state that ; so . ; Great .
Bro026_382	bk	So th So ; So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . ; Get down . ; I see .
Bns002_335	s	Two two things . ; So that 's uh that 's uh , my my problem . ; First of all , eh , this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism , ; so it is not connected with routing eh , anyhow .
Bro027_251	s	uh , the mailing list . ; OK , ; great . ; And he gave me all of the pointers and everything that I needed .
Bmr005_877	s	Is this proprietary ? ; Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? ; Uh . No . No . ; It was when I was working for the government .
Bmr018_480	b	But it won't work for IBM of course , ; it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels . ; Well , I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure , ; Yeah .
Bro027_748	%--	So so it 's ; Wow . ; You know . ; So it 's
Bmr031_548	qw	I think it is comparable to a video data rate . ; OK . ; So . ; How in the world are they gonna ever distribute this ?
Bed008_362	s	One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology ; now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that ; I think we can ; so that the belief - net itself has properties
Bmr005_1129	s	and there might be , you know ; There 's also um ; oh yeah , ; noise .
Bro004_989	s	we don't know ; I see . ; So there 's a question of whether you would ; Two e @ @ it 's one .
Bmr006_51	b	he 's comes from a signal - processing background , ; but I liked him a lot ; cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1104	x	But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the ; For example , this th th the dialogue history is is um , producing XML documents . ; M - three - L of course is XML . ; And the ontology that um , uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML .
Bmr028_994	b	No . You can run both . ; Yeah . ; And you can s ; Yeah .
Bmr010_710	b	Yeah . ; Well , that 's the ; It seemed to me when I was using Dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in , uh an enormous amount . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_588	qy	And And there 's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be ; It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine , ; right ? ; Didn't we already get that ?
Bmr013_664	%--	OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; We can try running
Bmr031_438	s	So it 's ; Well , the the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ? ; My feeling is no , it doesn't . ; Your audio , u these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that .
Bed016_811	aa	Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . ; is ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed003_1785	s	Mm - hmm . ; you know ? ; Just see what people say . ; And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with .
Bmr019_1578	b	Because it would be a different kind of meeting , ; Yeah . ; that 's what I 'm ; Yeah .
Bed006_1052	s	I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once , ; r Yes . ; but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose . ; Well , if I 'm if I 'm recipient of such a message
Bro028_506	s	Um , downloaded the scripts . ; They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , uh , data . ; Um , so I haven't run the scripts yet . ; Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it
Bro021_1372	d	um ; So . ; Uh , OK . ; S so , we switch off with this
Bmr015_616	b	Mm - hmm . ; So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro013_209	b	Yeah . ; It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data . ; And this is a a , you know , modern uh system ; Yeah .
Bed002_1361	bk	Ni ; That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower . ; Ahh . ; OK .
Bdb001_423	%--	they 're reasonably compatible . ; I mean , you you could ; You could probably translate between them . ; Yeah , that 's w
Bro017_1075	s	so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service
Bmr019_1770	bk	Eh , I I bring the chocolate , eh , to to tear , uh , with with you , ; Mmm . ; Ah . ; Oh .
Bmr005_654	b	you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bed014_104	s	Uh , there 's good news from Johno . ; The generation templates are done . ; So the trees for ; the XML trees for the for the gene for the synthesizer are written .
Bmr001_608	s	Oh ! ; For a couple of reasons . ; Well , but the @ @ There are two ways we could listen to it . ; There 's a sound there 's actually sound output built into this thing .
Bmr019_1720	ft	Yeah . ; I d so I I jus ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I would like to to to say thank you very much , eh , to all people in the group and at ICSI ,
Btr001_1557	%--	Oh , interesting . ; Mm - hmm . ; I You know , I feel I feel like it was , um , more personal . ; I was
Btr001_753	b	l you know , like ; With fricatives a lot . ; Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh ; Mmm .
Bmr028_1557	ba	we 're not interested , or w whatever ; Hmm . ; And so you you assume it 's given ; It 's too hard , usually .
Bmr016_1076	%--	Yep . ; Right . ; So remind me afterward ; And
Bed004_248	b	Mmm . ; And , uh she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , ; so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know uh , to do her career . ; Mmm .
Bed013_575	b	No that 's I mean that 's actually a problem . ; It 's difficu it 's more difficult to write on four pages than on eight . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr026_152	s	But uh the back - end was pretty smooth . ; Oh ; So I think , we 'll have something . ; It may not be as As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something .
Bmr016_214	s	And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns ; Let 's try it . ; isn't that right , Liz ? ; Righ - right , and you just they 're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits .
Bdb001_975	%--	but , um ; Well , I don't know . ; Is there anything else , ; like
Bmr019_13	s	Sure . ; Yeah . ; Two items , which was , uh , digits and possibly stuff on on , uh , forced alignment , ; which Jane said that Liz and Andreas had in information on ,
Bns001_168	s	So ; about the projects will be something , ; then , about publications will be another point , ; and Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that .
Bmr030_252	2	you know , and it 's all aligned with like the t the audio and the feature file . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , that 's great . ; Audio .
Bro026_611	aa	So these sugges these this , uh , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or ; Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . ; Using our features . ; Yeah ,
Bmr011_574	s	just getting the data , ; because there 's a number of sites ; like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , ; um , but they 'll be recording with video
Bro014_436	s	You know , a lot of the the cases it 's is ; Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up . ; I mean , in these cases , if you go from the the , uh ; I mean , I don't remember the numbers right off ,
Bmr005_991	s	They 're They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week . ; So actually , we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk ; and ; so , you know , Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that ,
Bmr024_55	b	SmartKom also , Andreas . ; Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things . ; At least , ; yeah ,
Btr002_1730	s	Yeah . ; I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too . ; Yeah . ; I think those are interesting .
Bmr003_1256	s	Yeah . ; Oh , I see . ; Right . ; We 'd like to .
Bns001_1697	s	or over ether ; Why ? ; What kind what kind IP over what do you call it ? ; N no nets ,
Bmr009_734	%--	Well , we we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway , ; Yes ; so somehow if once he gets going we 're gonna hafta come up with one ; and
Bmr020_505	s	because spurts are a defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses , ; and then we had things like discourse markers , ; uh , backchannels , ; uh , disfluencies .
Bro026_246	bk	Mmm . ; The the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bns002_168	s	Have in mind some routers are burnt here , at ICSI or whatever kind of thing , ; what will happen then even in a fixed network ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving .
Bmr016_756	bk	and and do all the naming automatically , ; OK . ; so you don't have to do it by hand . ; Alright .
Bro004_927	aa	If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you ; It - It 's the single net , ; I think they have one output . ; yeah .
Bmr014_55	bk	and the other thing is that it could ; the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . ; It might be a connector . ; Oh , OK .
Bro022_482	s	Oh . ; And I also , um , did some experiments about normalizing the phase . ; Um . ; So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at .
Bmr012_682	aa	It 's human subjects issues , ; Oh . ; I told you about that . ; Exactly .
Bro028_211	bk	I mean , the VAD doesn't use the same features there are . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Oh !
Bmr031_765	aa	and press the ; Yeah . A laptop . ; Yeah . ; Laptop ? Yeah ,
Bro003_77	%--	Um , I live in , um , the corner of campus . ; The , um , southeast corner . ; OK . ; OK , so would it be easier
Bro018_651	b	But you have the distances to work with . ; You have the distances to work with , ; Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities . ; yeah .
Bed002_390	s	there 's gonna be contextual things , ; there 're gonna be linguistic things , ; there 're gonna be discourse things , ; and they gotta be combined .
Bro022_423	s	Uh . Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; So , yeah , ; we have the new LDA filters ,
Bro019_943	s	And ; maybe we ; well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , ; and they have implementation of VTS techniques
Bmr016_1911	s	I think maybe something like that . ; Something like that ; maybe , yeah . ; Well , that 'd qualify .
Bed005_1158	aa	Oops , sorry . ; Right . ; That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ? ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1230	s	Mm - hmm . ; and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful ; Some more . ; and it it sounds like a good thing to do .
Bmr024_655	s	Yeah . ; So we save it because it 's it it 's potentially useful . ; Right . ; And now , what do we do with it is is a s separate question .
Bed012_956	b	Well , two to the power of the number of neurons . ; Right . ; But still finite . ; OK .
Bro014_970	b	one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_754	aa	uh , we 'll have to figure ways without it . ; Um , ; If they 're going to provide a , uh , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr018_1218	t3	I find it very comfortable too , but , uh , it looked like Andreas was having problems , ; and I think Morgan was saying it ; Well , but I had it on I had it on this morning and it was fine . ; Can I see that ?
Bro019_1477	s	Yeah , I hope . ; They 're available , ; and they 'll be able to get you something , ; so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while
Bmr009_1596	b	Or ? ; Oh . ; So . This one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_228	s	And so , ; uh , ; we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . ; I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both
Bed005_1208	s	So , " Noisy - OR " is a funny way of referring to this , ; because the Noisy - OR is only one instance . ; Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore . ; That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR .
Bmr020_940	b	That 's because of channel overlap . ; Well , ; and and so the th ; Hmm .
Bmr008_1112	s	Yeah . ; I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , source , destination , relation .
Bro014_398	b	Mmm . ; So , ; I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could , ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1455	s	The trouble is , that ; you know , I understand it in that context , ; but it but it is almost resentful . ; It 's almost like , you know , resentful of the data , resentful of the , um , the hard work that 's going into preparing the data
Bed005_1203	%--	I mean ; I don't know . ; So , really , i What a A Noisy - OR seems to kind of " neural - net - acize " these Bayes - nets ? ; Eh well to some
Bed015_295	s	Uh , that 's fine . ; Right . ; But it , um ; A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it .
Bed002_1063	s	and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . ; So it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .
Bro027_1050	s	Uh - huh . ; they just chose that . ; I I I think it 's kind of r arbitrary too . ; But but that 's that 's kind of what was chosen .
Bro021_60	s	Uh , second thing is , uh , the training of , uh , on - line normalization with two different means , ; one mean for the silence and one for the speech . ; Um , ; and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector .
Bmr007_1303	b	Actually actually I I thought that 's what you were giving us was another meeting and I was like , " Oh , OK ! " ; Thank you . ; " Ooo , cool ! " ; Yeah .
Bmr027_736	t3	Encrypt it . ; You can hide it . Yeah . ; and then they could subtract the beep out . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr003_1921	qw	So . ; Right , ; that 's the problem . ; Why ?
Bro004_1240	b	But I don't I don't think they are . ; Hmm . ; I mean that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , ; yeah
Bed006_889	b	Yeah . ; and you can also describe them in a general way as Source - Path - Goal schema ; and maybe there 's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know , how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_641	s	I don't know . ; Wha - whatever you generate . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed .
Bmr010_355	s	and ; I mean , basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world . ; and ; I mean , basically he 's he 's on it now .
Btr002_127	ba	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Oh . ; That 's very subtle .
Bmr019_603	%--	we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well ; but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using to working with . ; So what what do we do now ? ; Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to eh ,
Bmr008_1058	s	How about their birthday ? ; Good idea . ; I don't know . ; I mean , not not the year not the year
Bmr008_1653	%--	and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers . ; You could do that , ; yeah . ; I mean , be i And if they still overlapped , i i the
Bro024_1419	s	which has forty milliseconds latency . ; And then , after subtraction um , I add a constant to the energies ; and I have two cases d where The first case is where the constant is twenty - five DB below the mean speech energy ; and the other is thirty DB below .
Bmr021_916	b	I see . ; And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level . ; You know , so we 'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities . ; OK .
Bro027_1400	%	Uh , it ; Mm - hmm . ; No , actually , I think i ; m
Bed002_285	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Really small ? ; OK . I see . ; OK .
Bns002_1383	ft	Mm - hmm . ; So uh I I maybe I will be able to hopefully I will be able to to give you a better answer in the future . ; Oh , OK . ; One more time , many thanks Miguel .
Bro016_732	%--	But ; R right ? ; Mmm . ; Wh - ?
Bmr020_579	bk	and until it fi ; Made the font smaller and the narrows longer . ; Font smaller , ; yeah .
Bmr031_1619	bk	And and y you may you may not really need that for this . ; Well , we probably won't get that far . Yeah . ; Yeah . So I think that would be that would be the obvious thing to do . ; OK .
Bro003_1946	%--	But that 's what I thought they were gonna ; right ? ; Did they not do that , ; or ?
Bmr016_1283	bk	uh , you know , " looking at so - and - so " . ; So on the m ; on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left . ; Yeah .
Bro026_307	%	Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish , ; have you ? ; No , we didn't . ; No ,
Bro004_1377	s	I mean I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , ; right ? ; If the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still wouldn't be anything ; running through these a hundred times faster
Bed002_1145	%--	It 's also ; That should be ay We should be able to look at that ; No , ; u u y um
Bmr007_297	g	Mm - hmm . ; So we go over So we were we were talking over one another , and it 's just in each case , it 's just sort of one interval . ; Mm - hmm ? ; Right ?
Bmr016_576	qh	which you would expect ; but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth , ; um , leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some kind of uh , echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes . ; Um , why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list .
Bro016_487	s	Um . ; Could you say it again ? ; What what exactly did they do ? ; They used some parts of the , um , Italian database to train the voice activity detector , I think .
Bro018_653	s	Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , they they had a had a way to translate the distances into into probabilities with the with the simple um uh sigmoidal function .
Bmr028_1308	ba	I see . ; And fo for you to get a credit for it . ; So . ; That sounds great .
Bro023_731	bk	So ; Yeah . ; so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1437	s	Yeah , that 's fine ; if it 's if it comes only at the end . ; But suppose you want it embedded ? ; Well , then you 'd have to break all of your Bayes - nets into smaller Bayes - nets ,
Bmr010_842	s	because ; Yeah . ; actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know , is pretty good . ; So as long as you can stick a you know , a t a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter ,
Bed015_208	s	So , I 'm sorry . ; I didn't mean that one 's an in unintentional . ; So this should be semantic and ; Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent
Bns002_889	s	Yeah . ; Because if I have a device which uh can I use maybe for twenty - four hours , ; I do not have , in principle , really the constraint to uh deal with with uh power savings . ; Yeah , let let me let me answer you uh with a question .
Bmr008_36	ar	Anything ? ; Anything else going on ? ; That 's it . ; No .
Bro026_437	s	And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , " OK , this much effect " I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . ; You want to change them one at a time . ; Mm - hmm . ; So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way .
Bed014_697	%--	Yeah . Yeah . ; OK . ; But but what 's Robert 's saying is is , ; and I think he 's right , is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself all the synonyms and all you know , all the wo
Bed009_638	s	huh , ; it j ; Yeah I I agree . ; There is there 's a logic to dialogue which which is is separable .
Bmr016_1421	s	I have one question about the the " EH " versus like the " AH " and the " UH " . ; That 's partly a nonnative - native thing , ; OK . ; but I have found " EH " in native speakers too .
Bro027_1253	qw	And it Remind me again , ; the " highly mismatched " means that the ; Clean training and ; Uh , sorry ?
Bed005_432	s	e I 'm not sure e that ; Um well , we we 'll see , when we say , ; let 's test something , ; " Goodbye " , causes it to c to create basically an " Action Goodbye - End - Action " .
Bdb001_922	s	Right . ; even if your tools change . ; And so it seems to me that ; I mean , I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,
Bmr030_157	aa	Yeah . ; Ah . OK . And then it won't ; And then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta ; Right .
Bed003_1049	bk	Oh . ; W Ah , it was dead . To the world . ; God ! ; OK .
Bsr001_2438	b	It 's plenty bad just with digits , ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr010_657	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; As I said , who knows ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1335	s	but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that ; and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted , ; Yeah . ; and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality
Bed005_155	2	I see . ; Yeah . ; So it 's basically feature film and TV . ; Today
Bmr025_567	s	Um these these ones , they are much easier , ; there 's a bigger difference . ; So I 'm working on that ; and it it sorta works
Bns001_1351	b	Yeah , but but ; But you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align KPN with Siemens , for instance . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1089	s	OK . ; So this this uh header , well , it 's it 's a problem . ; Of course , there are also some some solutions ; like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source route routing ,
Btr001_940	b	A person says , " Mm - kay " ; Mm - hmm . ; then , ; Oh .
Bmr014_729	%--	I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . ; And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , " ; and then that group would need it ; S It seems like i
Bmr003_727	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah , we ; But if if there was a way to merge the two ; Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right
Bmr009_1251	aa	and are ; Each each one has pros and cons ; Well , I know . ; Right .
Bro021_857	s	And the clean speech the statistic of the clean speech is from a codebook . ; Mmm ? This is the idea . ; Well , like , this relation is not linear . ; The methods propose to develop this in a vectorial Taylor series approximation .
Bro003_1154	aa	More than six hours . ; More . ; For the Italian , ; yes .
Bmr029_274	b	Mm - hmm . ; but you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh who who speaks a lot , then effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr005_534	t3	I I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem , ; Some of it 's masking masked . ; Yeah . ; Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?
Bmr024_990	s	Yeah . ; The the CD is an alternative to tape . ; Yeah . ; ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable .
Bns002_788	bk	OK . ; I see . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr018_972	%--	yeah . ; That 's actually a better way to do it ; cuz the a the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than ; Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in s
Bro027_954	b	I don't know . ; I 'm surprised , ; because I expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1395	s	like in ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm . ; and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting
Bmr007_1035	t3	I I Sorry . ; I I have found that when when I I analyzed the the speech files from the , eh mike , eh from the eh close eh microphone , eh I found zones with a a different level of energy . ; Sorry , I have to go . ; OK .
Bro007_166	s	uh but uh uh ; Oh I see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay . ; Those look pretty good . ; Um let 's see that one
Bmr001_94	b	and then we can do it like that . ; I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things . ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bmr022_1440	s	You can back everything out . ; To your local , or to the global . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so people can make changes to their local
Btr002_2354	b	Oh yes ! Good example . ; Mmm . ; It 's it 's , uh like I don't know how I just transcribe it as I say , like , " click " ; Mmm .
Bro024_1748	b	Yeah . ; Slightly better . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_658	co	Yeah ; so we start with that different proto and it becomes eighty - eight , ; which is like some fifty percent improvement . ; S Wait a minute .
Bmr027_1115	s	Oh , really ? ; Huh - uh . ; Uh , it 's ; Oh , so it 's just jargon .
Bmr029_970	s	For w for Festival ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , you can just use it from the ; Yeah . Basically from the command line ,
Bmr013_161	g	do we do on TI - digits ? ; I don't remember . ; I mean , very good , ; right ?
Bed011_587	b	Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel , ; so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think . ; You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something , ; Yeah .
Btr001_1478	s	So what they get is like i t is they get something like " beep one " . ; And then then they get " beep two " , " beep three " . ; Chuck Wooters does the numbers . ; And , um , it cycles through .
Btr002_1800	aa	And that 's that 's not really very helpful . ; I wonder if like Microsoft has a word for it . ; Now I 'm now I 'm just wondering how they 're gonna transcribe you saying that . ; Yes .
Bmr006_637	b	Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is . ; OK , DC . ; I just don't remember , it might be DC . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_423	%--	Yeah , that we would be working on anyway . ; If there 's time . ; Yeah . ; Then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or
Bmr020_176	s	No . Well , according to the transcripts . ; or just overall volume ? ; Yeah . ; But re well regardless . I think it 's he 's he 's in all of them ,
Bed006_918	s	Um , well that 's that 's one one thing is that we can link up , ; think also that um we can have one or m as many as we want links from from the schema up to the s action um description of it . ; Hmm . ; But the notion I got from Nancy 's idea was that we may f find sort of concepts floating around i in the a action description of the action f " Enter " frame up there that are , e when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the the S Source - Path - Goal schema ,
Bro024_1648	s	Mmm . ; Because I mean , it should have a similar effect if you ; Yeah . ; I mean , you you have now several stages of smoothing , so to say .
Bed005_5	s	Let 's see . ; OK . Ami , do yours ; then we 'll open it ; and I think it 'll be enough .
Bro021_573	%--	The big one takes a while . ; Yeah . That takes two , three weeks . ; Two , three weeks . ; So but , you know , uh , you can get
Bmr029_737	s	OK . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Cuz we still all have tha the that other one going ,
Bmr005_1247	s	So I think it 's something we should look into , ; you know , we 'll collect what we collect here ; hopefully they will collect more at UW also ; and um and maybe we have this other source .
Bdb001_1104	s	So , ; um , ; if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking . ; It won't it 'll be independent of the time bins ,
Bmr012_1248	ba	That 's a great idea . ; Yep , ; Super idea . ; that 'd be very interesting .
Bro023_91	s	So that was encouraging . ; And , um , ; that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like ; And , um , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system .
Bmr030_865	s	Yeah . ; And I for I 'm not sure what attributes we attach to the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , ; but it could be SB - one - hundred . ; And so if you query for f all machines that have that attribute , then you should see the names of the new machines .
Bmr009_1329	b	U unless you 're from Midland , Kansas . ; Midland ; But . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2120	s	Mm - hmm . ; I 'll end utterances with " so " or " and " . ; Yeah . ; and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . "
Bmr016_549	bk	Yeah OK . ; So if somebody wanted to do that , if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits a a non - digit word versus in digit word , uh that would be a good thing to do , ; but I think someone would have to express interest in that . ; I see .
Bro014_63	bk	And what these numbers refer to is the number of times that the , uh , HMM re - estimation is run . ; It 's this program called H E ; But in HTK , what 's the difference between , uh , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ? ; OK .
Bro004_368	s	Yeah . ; right ? ; Right . ; It sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using .
Bro017_997	b	You you have a step where you you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition . ; It would be quick . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_600	b	And it was a really big deal . ; And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily ; and , uh , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1400	s	We don't know , ; that , you know And and it certainly helps a lot . ; but , yeah . ; I mean , le let 's put it that way .
Bmr018_610	aa	This is error you 're talking about ? ; whe ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_226	s	No . ; No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? ; Of of of uh eighteen ; Eighty .
Bed013_1260	s	the simulation that 's , according to it you know , that that corresponds to it , and as well the as discourse , ; Mm - hmm . ; whatever , conte infor in discourse information , ; such as the mood ,
Bmr011_610	%--	and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes . ; And there we 're already using fourteen . ; And we actually only have fifteen . ; One of them 's
Bed008_737	%--	What 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . ; Uh or something , I don't know , ; but . ; I guess the the question uh is
Bmr028_549	ba	But two s ; Or you can Yeah . You can use the one with one second or whatever . ; Do you mean a ? ; I I I There 's no not much difference between the the one - second and the two - second one .
Bmr003_422	ba	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; In doing , um , some of our first automatic speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data ; Great idea .
Bns001_1081	b	but and but I 'm I just wanted to say it is being used . ; But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between , no . ; I 'm not a supporter of it . ; Huh - huh - huh .
Bro022_935	b	I guess it depends on how you do it . ; But I mean , that 's that 's been a useful thing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_59	%--	The recognition also takes non - negligible amount of time . ; So we might wanna restrict it to , maybe , a few meetings , ; if you want to do a full comparison . ; It has to be enough so that
Bmr029_364	b	Mm - hmm . ; So , you could get those going while Dave is , um , creating waveforms for the r retraining the short male models . ; Yeah . Once we know which segmentations we 're using . ; Yeah .
Bro019_464	s	Yeah . ; So ; So that that The baseline itself ; I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent .
Bed003_865	s	Does it have nice walls ? ; It has wonderful walls . ; Excellent . ; Um - And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth ,
Bmr011_357	s	But ; but , uh , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , uh , head models and microphone things . ; And so , uh , he 's he and possibly a student , there w ; there 's , uh , a student of his who gave a talk here last year ,
Bns001_1080	s	but ; but and but I 'm I just wanted to say it is being used . ; But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between , no . ; I 'm not a supporter of it .
Bmr019_769	%--	and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it . ; But then that constraint of sort of uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general . ; Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint , ; or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance , or ?
Btr002_2973	s	but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it ; and and that 's not communicative . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , my my the way I do those things when I hear those , if is to I use in parentheses one " X " so it 's marked .
Bro024_573	s	Yeah , yeah . ; So by putting this noise ; Yeah . ; Yeah , if we look at the figures on the right , we see that the reference system is very bad .
Bmr009_1444	bk	Well . Well . I mean , pure ; OK , we 'll do it that way . ; Actually , I like that a lot . ; OK .
Bed008_753	%--	I mean the that 's the the issue is um ; would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . ; And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . ; Maybe um if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of um
Bro027_1183	s	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch .
Bmr023_380	%--	and Yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what I 'm just looking into . ; OK . ; The the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . ; Now there was , uh , I g guess
Bed015_1680	b	It 's like it 's like what 's happening that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; So that 's that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_57	s	Um Another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes . ; He was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds ; uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before . ; Um And uh and the other thing is that the yeah doing the subtracting off the mean and the variance in the uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain , may not be the right thing to do .
Bmr008_392	s	OK , in some sense you could say that " Please leave blank but but don't lie . " ; So that 's why I want to put That 's why I want to put s " Optional , Age " , ; so that if they don't want to put it , they leave it blank . ; They might lie anyway .
Bmr029_714	bk	have you ? ; Nope . ; I was wondering if they were in . ; OK .
Bmr019_1412	ba	Yeah . ; Maybe . ; Maybe . ; Pretty hokey .
Bmr019_1108	b	I was trying to find what 's a word for a continuous region with pauses around it ? ; Hmm . ; Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use use " spurt " for that . ; Good .
Bro026_517	qy	It certainly doesn't take much space . ; Right . ; So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? ; Do you need to have an added layer or something ?
Btr001_1979	s	Yeah . ; it 's it 's really interesting , Also , ; Mmm . ; i it 's a persona ,
Bed005_1219	s	With the neural net , right , eh , things come in , you have a function that combines them ; and ; Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true . ; It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that .
Bmr007_1043	s	But he 's not gonna even read that . ; I know . ; Oh . ; including overlap zone .
Bed003_75	br	Can you maximize the window ? ; Proceed . ; You want me to ; Wait , what do you want me to do ?
Bdb001_528	s	Um , ; Right . ; but ; I mean , I like this .
Bmr010_1228	bk	Um ; I think it just whoever is interested can do that . ; I mean , so if someone wants to use that data ; OK .
Bed010_71	s	yeah , ; OK . ; Alright . ; And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff ,
Bmr009_1588	ba	And if if ; Well that 's that 's that 's true , too . ; Yeah . ; This is a a useful thing for us .
Bmr016_755	s	And and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files ; and and do all the naming automatically , ; OK . ; so you don't have to do it by hand .
Bro026_693	%--	I just ; No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . ; So I wouldn't ; So it it 's
Btr002_2074	aa	and I would hear people speaking to me , ; Yeah . ; and I would transcribe them in my head ! ; Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh yeah .
Bro019_1211	s	So , ; when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking " oh , OK , ; so they 're picking on something ; they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . "
Bsr001_743	s	Yeah . ; They won't be running on IRAM . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM .
Bed008_1527	%--	OK . ; O OK . ; OK . ; I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know ,
Bed014_1085	ba	and that might be fine , too . ; So , maybe I 'll send you some ; Um , if you have time after this I 'll show you the noun phrase thing . ; OK . That would be cool .
Bmr018_1400	s	sure . ; So . It works . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and they have I mean they have better adaptation than we had than that that system ,
Bro025_437	%	Yeah . And it ; Yeah . ; And then we have to be careful with that also with the neural net ; Yeah .
Bdb001_463	s	end equals some other node ID " , ; and then " type " would be " utterance " . ; Hmm . ; You know , so it 's very similar .
Bed015_1826	%--	Yeah . ; Uh , so , um , ; I I don't know the answer ; but but , um , it does seem that ,
Btr002_1660	s	Yeah . ; I like those ; Those are th E - would these be the EDU meetings ? ; That 's what I think .
Btr002_317	bk	Mm - hmm . ; " eh , that 'll be a problem " . ; then I would think that there should be a period there . ; Period . Right .
Bed011_676	b	That 's that 's sort of part of th that 's not a destination reason , that 's sort of " en passant , " right . ; Right . ; That goes with the " energy depletion " function , blech . ; Yeah .
Bro013_489	b	I don't know . ; I I think that I have d another graph , ; but I 'm not sure . ; Yeah .
Bro014_948	bk	The the more obvious is that that ; well , using the th the FFT , um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean . ; But So , ; Yeah .
Bro012_1312	s	and ; uh um ; I see , yeah . Mm - hmm . ; if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors
Bed002_852	s	Yeah ? ; I mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort , ; unless we would ; We can show it walks to , you know .
Bmr005_517	co	The the the far - field , ; yeah . ; you have to to analyze ; you have to to process .
Bns001_1390	%--	and eh of course , I cannot imagine that uh tomorrow I 'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks , ; four different providers on it . ; Maybe I 'm wrong ; but
Bmr013_302	b	Because that really wasn't what it look like . ; Right . ; It didn't look like a sequence of phones ; Right .
Bro019_1320	s	So . ; Um . ; Mmm . ; There was a paper in ICASSP this ICASSP over the uh extracting some higher - order uh , information from the cepstral coefficients
Bro025_333	bk	Mmm . ; the the biggest , whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bmr019_814	s	and , at first it sort of looked like a mess ; and then the more I looked at it , I thought " OK , well it 's moving these words leftward ; and " You know , it wasn't that bad . ; It was just doing certain things wrong .
Bns001_759	b	And then is UMTS only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology . ; And you have to match these things anyway . ; It 's like a normal ethernet . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bmr009_600	b	I can do that . ; uh uh ; like probably , if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being covered half time on something else ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2803	s	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Cuz I 've been told I mumble . ; Oh ! Huh ! ; Um , and I guess I used to be worse about it .
Bmr027_87	aa	No , the only th the only mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; That 's right .
Bmr020_1369	no	Well , eh , listening does take time too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know ,
Bmr031_1102	bk	So so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it , ; but you can't actually encode , um encode someth ; Yeah . I un I understand the problem . ; Yeah , exactly .
Bro017_595	s	it 's not , yeah , finished yet . ; Mm - hmm . ; So have you been running some new experiments ? ; I I thought I saw some jobs of yours running on some of the machine
Bed005_1359	h	But Uh uh SmartKom 's gonna need an ontology . ; Yes , u a w a lot of people are aware of that . ; I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ? ; Um
Bmr024_713	b	OK . ; They 're actually talking ; So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ? ; Hmm .
Bed006_1609	%	Oh yeah . That 's why I 'm glad that I 'm not involved in working it out . ; OK . ; So it 's at Friday at three ? ; there that 's
Bmr006_1102	bk	With what ? ; With what ? ; Right . Mixed . ; the the mix , mixed speech .
Bdb001_843	ba	Huh . ; so that , uh , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database . ; Mm - hmm . ; My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough .
Bed011_397	%--	No , he uh , he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful , ; Take care of him . ; OK . ; so s
Bro013_79	g	but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail ; Ah , well , I mean uh what Chuck tried to to to do ; Yeah , ; but he 's doing it with the same data , right ?
Bed002_706	b	The No , that 's fine . ; I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_782	s	Remove some noise but not too much . ; And when we put the m m the , em , VAD , the result is better . ; And we put everything , the result is better , ; but it 's not better than the result that we have without VTS .
Bsr001_1275	s	Well , ; one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is , ; um , ; I mean , y you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards .
Bro004_1257	b	That 's right . ; But something that ; what I mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_810	b	Mm - hmm . ; cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situations . ; But if you go to very very fine categories , it 's very binary . ; Mmm .
Bmr024_380	s	Yeah . ; Yes . ; So , I think if they 're processing it at ; I mean , it 'll be it will be in the midst of a digit string .
Bmr023_1223	bk	So he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the ? ; No . I don't know , i I I don't know . ; You have to check with him . ; Yeah .
Btr002_141	t1	Hmm . ; And then , ; um , ; let 's see .
Bed011_1035	aa	Right . ; and all that kind of stuff . ; Um , so there 's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions ; Absolutely .
Bmr018_364	s	what what are they looking at visually ? ; Well , they have a choice . ; They could choose any signal to look at . ; I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed .
Bmr011_432	s	Oh , so just morning . ; from from Oakland . ; Right . ; So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight
Bro022_1179	t3	Mm - hmm . ; I don't I don't have a good feeling for it . ; Um . ; Pratibha .
Bro027_197	%--	Uh , it might even be sooner . ; Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , ; seventeenth ? ; Yeah , I don't know if he 's before
Bro019_708	%	Hmm . ; So I don't know why the well - matched is ; Right . ; uh
Bro018_787	aa	I mean uh ; Uh . ; That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project . ; Yeah .
Bns003_772	s	Claudia , I still mentioned , Have you other things ? ; For me , as I said before I will be funded by a d uh by the ministry of , uh , the German government for research in the project so - called Invinet ; That seems to be sure . ; And I got absolutely freedom to do what I would like to do ,
Bns003_169	%--	And now we are , in principle , in the state we have to do it with a project area . ; But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested . ; Um ; and the alumni page , in principle , we have to ,
Bed015_2045	b	And it may or may not be the best way . ; I 'm sorry , ; you had news . ; Mmm .
Bmr015_164	s	Yeah , I was just wond ; I thought I had had all of them back from you . ; No , not yet . ; And then the other thing is that , uh , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by Liz
Bmr023_857	s	Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent . ; So ; Right . ; Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight .
Bro024_848	b	But isn't that s again sort of the idea of the additive thing , ; if it as as we had in the J stuff ? ; I mean , basically if if you have random data , um , in in the time domain , then when you look at the s spectrum it 's gonna be pretty flat . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_106	b	OK . ; Uh ; Uh OK so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian . ; Yeah .
Bed009_116	%	Yeah . ; So when do you guys leave ? ; Um we 're here through Sunday , ; Oh
Bmr021_107	b	I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it ; and still not reasonable , ; yeah . ; Right .
Bmr009_391	s	He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap . ; I don't know if he 's talked with you yet . ; Yeah . ; But in sort of honing in on these different types
Bmr018_421	s	Yeah , it 's very slow to do that . ; It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the ; I I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly ; cuz but it t it takes long enough that it 's just not a practical alternative .
Bed010_1041	ba	Great , yeah . ; Cuz they 've actually these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . ; So we 'll set that up . ; Cool .
Bro022_571	b	I guess it 's triphones . ; It 's triphone . ; I think it 's probably more than that . ; Huh .
Bdb001_747	s	or else you 'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures ; Right . ; You 'd need a p sort of a paradigm for how to do it . ; But an example would be " find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising ,
Bed004_297	%--	Is is this make sense to everybody ? ; Yeah . ; So , I don't I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to to to make a big presentation . ; I don't think you should
Bro028_1114	s	because , uh if you ignore the the selection part ; because we are going into a a very powerful , uh , nonlinearity ; that , uh , in fact is combining over time and frequency , ; and is coming up with its own you know , better than Gabor functions
Bed012_271	aa	h This thingy . ; Yeah , it 's " The Crown " . ; The crown of pain ! ; Yes .
Bmr011_1663	s	The Business school . ; " If you 're really angry at someone use our conference room . " ; Uh , the business school might be good . ; I actually spoke with some students up there
Bed013_742	bk	And say , this is bad . Nuh ? ; Yeah . ; And then we can say , uh well what we do is this . ; OK .
Bmr021_71	no	So you seem to get better signal with this one . ; The other thing is , is it just a few people who don't like them in the EDU group ? ; Cuz ; I don't know ,
Bmr001_583	ba	So . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; We 've got lots of bits of noise . ; These theories things are pretty amazing .
Btr002_1338	s	Yeah ! ; Yep . ; Well , y it was also , like you ; Yeah , the interface was different .
Bmr003_928	s	I mean , that that 's easy enough . ; Right . ; I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it . ; A little double - blind - ear kind of thing .
Bro003_1072	s	OK . ; And , ; u uh , I think the computation isn't so much of a problem . ; I think it 's more the memory .
Bmr001_237	bk	I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions . ; I think uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's if it 's near field , the mathematics of beam beam steering is different . ; But . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr008_1088	s	Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out . ; Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact . ; And this would and and we discussed this , ; this is with reference to like the DTD ,
Bed014_929	ba	I mean that ; The I 'd like to have them all in one day , ; so package them up and then ; Yeah , I can understand that .
Bed014_625	%--	Yeah . ; I mean , we could look at dialo ; Yeah . ; this is
Bro019_1282	b	I can I will try to do that . ; Yeah . ; What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_584	s	Carroll , ninety - three . ; Um . I There is a a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem . ; Hmm . ; So it 's they actually say " the monkey in front of the car ,
Bed003_1672	s	you know ? ; Ah . ; You know . So . ; Unless it boots up with networking .
Bro016_24	s	There we go . ; Um . ; So other than reading digits , what 's our agenda ? ; I don't really have , uh , anything new .
Bmr024_1206	s	So , we had reached the point where ; I 'm well rehearsed . ; Yeah . ; we had reached the point where , um , on the male portion of the development set , the , um or one of the development sets , I should say the , um the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features .
Bro016_158	s	Well , um ; uh , ; part of what 's going on , um , is the , uh , the range of values . ; So , if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range , and taking the appropriate root .
Bmr028_1412	b	We 're de - legitimizing the experiment . ; We 're not saying that the data is cheating data . ; We 're saying th we are cheating by using this data . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1267	b	it 's in development still , ; but it definitely has various feature slots , attributes , um , bindings between things ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1563	qy	Does that ? The mean and variance . Have it be zero mean and unity variance . ; Mean and variance . ; OK . ; But do you do this , say , just in the vowel regions ,
Bed006_1271	b	And it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy ; Yeah . ; um but if it has if it 's supposed to be categorized in category X then the corresponding schema X will be among the structures that that follow . ; Right .
Bro028_995	bk	so we 'll throw it out ; and we 're gonna randomly select another feature from the set of possible basis functions . ; Hmm ! ; Yeah .
Bed011_448	s	Yeah . ; So yeah I th that seems pretty straight forward . ; But were you saying that ; I need those back by the way .
Bed013_954	b	Mm - hmm . ; Or , you know , " how do I get to X ? " ; discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance , is a good indication . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_8	bk	Yeah . ; One , two ; OK , ; u OK .
Bed005_1231	s	But anyway . ; So ; And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh ; There are a couple other ones .
Bmr006_1469	bk	It 's slightly different . ; Ah - oh . ; So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form . ; OK .
Bsr001_2271	s	y that you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before
Bmr003_1663	%--	actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . ; But assuming we can get around that somehow . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well you were saying , I think it can read
Bmr016_1234	bk	S ; Right . ; But , if it 's ; OK .
Bro019_798	bk	You can do both , ; but I cannot tell you what 's which one might be better ; or ; Hmm .
Bmr010_218	%--	No . W w we originally we did that ; Yeah . It was IS two . ; Just ; but we saw , uh ,
Bmr003_2304	aap	And and ; And it 's total crap . ; It 's total crap . ; Well , it 's useless for this function .
Bro017_1152	b	Uh - huh . ; The range of values . ; Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_39	ba	She said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she 's working on . ; Yeah . That 's great . ; Um ; And that works fine
Bed011_445	b	and ; you know , any of that stuff . ; uh You know , " Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning ? " ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1616	b	because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , you know , versus " um " . ; So I just always wrote it as U M . ; And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five . ; OK .
Bmr001_219	b	Because there may be other considerations that will go into the design . ; I mean , uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are I don't know might change this design , So . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro026_776	bk	Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . ; So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors ; and what 's what 's the plan about that ? ; OK .
Btr002_2201	s	cuz he just came on the elevator ; and he says ; uh , and then she then she said something ; and he says , " Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . "
Bmr030_316	%--	Oh . Oh . ; yeah . ; Sorry . ; Um , yeah , but , so Kamal has , uh
Bed005_956	s	Good . ; And what 's the other one ? ; so that just we know what the d agenda is ? ; Um , the Wu paper ,
Bro027_1812	s	Be interesting to look at the ; Yeah , ; for the ; I wonder if you could do this .
Bmr009_1473	aa	OK . ; Yeah . ; We uh We done ? ; Yep .
Bed003_1299	s	Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , ; which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's like There are Those are the two options .
Bed015_1382	s	Yeah . ; Um . y ; Right . That makes sense . ; So I mean , there 's this stuff in the off in the scenario ,
Bns001_1615	s	and ; So that makes sense to do in this ar This , I mean the Bay Area ; Hm - hmm . ; with a group of uh a few people ,
Bmr002_253	s	OK . ; Just as long as it 's with you know , uh within the constraints . ; What - what 's your mike number , Jane ? ; Number four .
Bmr028_869	%--	But , I I 'm just concerned , of course , about that ; Oh , I see . You mean when only one person is talki ; Yep . ; Yes . We could we could try tha
Bro013_299	qy	That was that topic . ; What else we got ? ; Um . ; Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions ,
Bro024_636	2	Yeah . ; There 's there 's a ; I I I guess you are using finally this the scheme which they ; Which is there in the spreadsheet .
Bmr008_381	%--	I think it 's not necessary to put uh " Optional " . ; Yeah , people can leave it blank if they ; I think people decide uh , in that moment . ; I I think people in Speech are gonna wanna
Bro012_422	ba	Yeah . ; If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent , ; five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , ; but five over ten is is big .
Bmr020_791	bk	Yeah . ; You don't n m ; Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1628	b	But I think I th Again , I think that sort of that that would be good , ; and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_462	s	it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be ; yeah . ; And you could tell that ; It 'd be a complete , set then .
Bed013_544	%	and have no you know , we can't write an ACL type paper where we say , " OK , we 've done this ; Mm - hmm . ; and now we 're whatever percentage better than everybody else " . You know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_421	bd	Well I think it 's I think it 's two gig an hour . ; Is it two gig an hour ? ; I 'm off by an order of magni ; That 's alright .
Bed005_91	%--	But , um . ; Yep . Makes sense . ; That , uh ; yeah , so we might actually ,
Bmr010_1512	s	Yeah . ; Or , you know , how b short should they be ? ; So , ; th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things
Btr002_1098	s	Or no ! ; Yeah . ; I just get used to it . ; Uh - oh .
Bmr003_2332	aa	I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . ; Wow . ; Uh , let the record show at uh at f four thirty - five Adam Janin says ; Well w yeah , exactly .
Bmr016_1754	b	We 'll probably add it to the language model . ; But we should add it to the dictionar ; No , to the pronunciation model . ; Yeah .
Bed012_12	%--	But . I thought you you said you were adding stuff ; but I don't know . ; Uh , no . ; This is
Bmr023_459	ar	So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? ; Yeah . So , um , uh , Jane and Adam and I had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting ; Did you record it ? ; No .
Bed008_802	co	Um ; so this might be ; What next ? ; Well you tell me ,
Buw001_1441	ba	Mm - hmm . ; That 's good . ; I wouldn't even say that " that they learned " . ; I like that .
Bro019_342	s	So ; So I tried ; uh , ; And u First I tried just LDA .
Bsr001_1009	bk	high involve high in high involvement style . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr010_1546	qw	what ; were the classifier from Javier or classifier from Thilo ? ; W What happen with the second step ? ; I I mean , what what happen with the , eh the , uh , clu the , uh the clu the clustering process ?
Bed013_135	s	Well we 'd have to seed that , ; I mean . ; No . Let 's we have to we have some some top - down processing , given certain setting . ; OK , now we change nothing , and just say ask something .
Bns001_946	g	um , um , ; KPN interests ? ; Because , I believe s if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the Multicast stuff , and KPN is very interesting in UMTS stuff , and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on , but only for the uh IP - layer technology , then , why do the mapping of multica also potential mapping of Multicast , I think , must be of major interest for them . ; Right ?
Bmr002_557	s	I mean , you have the S T M format , where you have you know , every phrase , every utterance is is a single speaker . ; I mean , is that the right way to do it ? ; Or ; Well , every utterance is a single speaker ,
Bmr005_868	s	I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . ; And uh , ; you know , you can ; It seemed like the right thing to do .
Bro018_1180	s	Do you know which one it is ? ; It 's trained on a lot of different things . ; Um . ; It 's trained on uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home ,
Bed005_1230	%--	Uh ; But anyway . ; So ; And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh
Bmr025_492	s	Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . ; Ooo . ; I mean they 're on th right , these , ; but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files .
Bmr029_210	b	But , first first , of course , you would wanna process the training data , ; because we wanna get that started . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro026_998	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . ; Right .
Bmr002_482	co	And otherwise , as part of a grant , you can you can do it . ; some sort of minimal wage . ; Yeah . ; Well , we we need to We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan ,
Bed016_799	aap	so if the film left , ; you know state is being near film . ; So running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere . ; Or being out of something as , uh as well .
Bro022_1019	b	So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , ; and then it never estimated , ; because I assumed that it was always silence . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_998	s	OK . ; I um , I , unfortunately , have to run , ; So . ; but , um I can imagine uh building a um model of speaker change detection that takes into account both the far - field and the uh actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th for all of the speakers .
Bro018_789	b	That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No .
Bsr001_2124	aa	Already ! ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; That 's right .
Bro012_178	aa	It 's not ; and it 's better better latency , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1786	aa	Everyone ready ? ; S reading simultaneous digits ? Three ! Two ! One ! ; Yeah . ; Yep . Yep .
Bro024_752	bk	so ; Mmm . ; So . ; Yes .
Bmr023_372	aa	Mmm , yeah . That was a thing I I planned working on , is , uh , to use the the transcriptions which are done by now , and to to use them as , uh ; Oh . ; Oh , the new ones ; Yeah .
Bsr001_602	aa	Right . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm , ; yeah .
Bns001_1014	aa	the same i uh web servers . ; If they provide the right content uh , spit out the right uh WML language . ; So it 's it 's really a different network technology I think . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1983	s	People at UW wanna look at it . ; I mean , it 's it 's internal until ; Right . ; Internal to the project .
Bro023_118	%	That that 's true . ; Um , ; I mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing . ; Wa
Bmr028_478	%--	And it ; M ; And , uh , then there 's still m um ; Miguel is still an active member of the group and he 's
Bed012_366	s	So the But I guess the k the question that I was as er wondering or maybe Robert was proposing to me is ; But ; How do we d make the decision on as to which one to listen to ? ; Yeah , so , the final d decision is the combination of these three .
Bro010_403	b	But maybe it 's just the discrimination ; and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . ; S maybe . ; Yeah .
Bro012_426	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important . ; I see . I see .
Bmr016_2122	b	A actually even like the word " read " and " read " ; Those are two different words . ; They 're spelled the same way , right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_674	%--	Yeah ? ; It is an empirical question , it seems like . ; Yea ; Because because it because um again if you 're just compensating for the gain ,
Bro003_1084	g	It 's not really two to the seventh . ; But it 's but but i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings ; cuz these were all trained individually . ; Right ?
Bmr019_1343	s	That 's true . ; That 's another issue , ; but ; By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may you may feel ,
Bmr031_1154	s	I gotta remember to beep that out . ; Who was that ? ; No ; So anyway . So I 've been preparing for that .
Bro004_278	qw	Yeah , a fraction of it . ; A part of it , ; yeah . ; How m how much bigger is it ?
Bns002_1387	s	So . ; Oh , than thanks , Michael , for your computer . ; No problem . ; So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal .
Bro015_207	s	And uh So I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely you know decrease the number of iterations that we do ; and um , ; at least while we 're , you know , working on uh all different of kinds of variations , and that would let us , you know , pump through a lot more experiments . ; So um I still have to to send everybody a pointer about uh how to run the um HTK system on the Linux boxes and about changing these number of iterations so that so that you can do that .
Bed017_777	bk	but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again , ; right ? ; Absolutely . Yeah . ; Yeah . OK .
Bed006_1464	%--	and I don't really just I just don't know what to make of this ; Mm - hmm . ; and what this is for , and stuff like that , you know , ; so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it ,
Bed003_46	bd	Yeah , um Well , " the search for the middle layer " . ; It 's basically uh talks about uh It just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , ; I can read ! ; I 'm kidding .
Bmr024_52	t1	Well , let 's see . ; I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing . ; And also the SmartKom thing should b ; SmartKom also , Andreas .
Bro024_1625	%--	Go ahead . ; Yeah . ; Your your smoothing was @ @ uh , over this s so to say , the the factor of the Wiener . ; And then it 's , uh
Btr002_1604	s	When people get really loopy , ; and start telling lots of jokes , I think . ; Yeah . ; I enjoy always transcribing those sections .
Bmr020_1876	ba	Alright . ; Yeah . ; I think that that will be a little bit of a problem ; That 's great .
Bsr001_1021	bk	Yeah . ; good way of saying it . ; That 's what it 's called . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_875	s	I I think it 's frequent in in the meeting . ; Yeah . ; We tried both . ; Uh , currently , um , we use special words .
Bmr008_830	qw	Air conditioning . ; You know . ; So , region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest . ; " Where did you live ? "
Bmr016_801	ba	Great , great . ; OK . ; So . ; Terrific .
Bmr014_841	bk	Just put the button on on the web page which say " please send me the the scripts " . ; Oh that 's interesting . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bed011_480	b	but the person was able to look at it and say " OK , This is what I would actually do . " ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_281	s	Yeah . ; It just seems to me jus ; It would be cool to see it ; It would be cool like to see to hear it and see it ,
Bmr010_46	aa	Uh ; We talk about the the results of ; You have some ; Yeah .
Bed009_1034	b	You could do this . ; But uh from our point of view this is also a research project ; and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this , ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_408	s	Your your file format can know about know that you 're talking about language and speech , which is what I chose , and time , ; or your file format can just be a graph representation . ; And then the application has to impose the structure on top . ; So what it looked like ATLAS chose is , they chose the other way ,
Bro024_1005	s	Yeah , I mean , I talked to to uh , I ta Uh , I talked , uh , about it with with Hynek . ; I mean , there is ; This is ; So So , basically our our position is that , um , we shouldn't be unduly constraining the latency at this point
Bro013_219	b	Yeah it it 's not that surprising . ; But to me it just it just meant a practical point that um if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should uh ; Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's uh , uh it seems like too large a number , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_149	d	Ah . ; Sorry . ; Can I ? ; Yeah ?
Bmr014_274	s	Mm - hmm . ; Has that started , or is that ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that .
Bmr014_531	s	More of an attempt to ; Yeah . ; I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , ; It was a technical term that she didn't recognize ,
Bmr027_873	s	Right . ; It 's very nice . ; Yeah . ; I I like the high - tech aspect of it ,
Bmr014_968	b	Obviously they don't have to . ; I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble ; we have ; Yeah .
Bns001_306	s	maybe even a UMTS - to - WaveLAN - gateway , ; or I 'm not sure if that 's possible like we U - if UMTS re contains redirects or whatever , like switches . ; I 'm not sure about it . ; It could be .
Btr002_1833	%	Sorry . ; Yeah ? ; sorry , to I just remembered one thing that really was you needed ; Yeah .
Btr001_691	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Me too , ; Me too . ; yeah . Yeah .
Bed006_854	s	OK . ; S S ; OK , so one question . ; This was in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious ,
Bed002_209	s	I don't think I did . ; I guess these g have got better filters . ; Cuz I sent it to everybody . ; You just blew it off .
Bed008_287	s	w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local ; Right . ; Right . ; more likely to view if he 's a tourist
Buw001_1892	b	That 's that 's what I wanna work with , ; is is things that s the wrong material but the right da the right source . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1162	g	I mean it 's just that I 'm not sure what the ; Is the question , for this particular construction how we specify that that 's the information it provides ? ; Or or asked for ? ; b Both sides , right ?
Bsr001_874	bk	Um . ; Cuz they were saying some some some up to eight speakers . Maybe they ; maybe some other data for that part , ; Uh - huh .
Bro026_712	s	It 's , uh It 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . ; I see . ; Yeah , ; and So the noise is There is a range of different noises also um which are selected randomly and added randomly , uh , to the files .
Bro003_1334	s	D I begin to work with the Italian database to nnn , to with the f front - end and with the HTK program and the @ @ . ; And I trained eh , with the Spanish two neural network with PLP and with LogRASTA PLP . ; I don't know exactly what is better if if LogRASTA or JRASTA . ; Well , um , JRASTA has the potential to do better ,
Bmr020_857	%--	So , ; that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things ; but ; So , we should probably talk about the IBM transcription process stuff that
Bed006_334	t3	but ; Hmm ? ; I 'm not sure I totally understand everything that 's being talked about ; Like so So it 's just based on like the materials you had about Heidelberg .
Bdb001_635	%--	But it 's just not overtly in the ; what ; OK . ; Um , cuz this is exactly the kind of
Bro014_573	%--	Yeah . ; Wha - what do you mean ? ; Yeah , ; So y so you
Btr002_3303	bd	it 's really grasping for details . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , um , ; I I f I think , and it may be that it was not from anybody here ,
Bro019_487	%--	OK . ; Uh . ; No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update . ; Ye
Bro028_812	s	Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; So they had like ten quantiles
Bmr011_183	s	Mm - yeah . ; Also what we 've talked before about getting another , uh , radio , ; Right . ; and so then that would be , you know , three more .
Btr002_1891	s	and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again , ; and just the q the quotes around the word were driving me crazy . When they kn knowing ; when to put the quotes and when ; And then they were talking about like the difference between " uh " when it 's " a " or when it 's " uh " ,
Bmr016_1452	s	They 've been like " eh " ; like that have bee has been transcribed to " EH " . ; Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; And sometimes it 's stronger ,
Bmr011_475	s	Alright . ; And one one notable difference u u ; actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , ; but one one , uh , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes .
Bro017_528	b	he got a job uh at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen . ; Hmm ! ; So it 's like professor u university professor ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_586	%--	I think that 's right . ; Oh , I yeah , I , uh , uh I think that 's Not k I th ; I don't think it 's completely right . ; I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b
Bmr024_600	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I see no reason not to do all of them . ; That that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording .
Bmr030_672	ba	Give us a couple more wireless channels . ; Oh , so we can get rid of the uh ; Yep . ; Oh ! That 'll be nice .
Bro023_584	%	Mm - hmm . ; It gives like negative Well , in in like some Italian and TI - digits , ; Yeah , ; some @ @ .
Bsr001_1487	s	Oh , right . ; Oh . ; um ; And we have eight channels .
Bmr025_440	b	In in the Key files now ? ; Mm - hmm . ; The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which ; Ah .
Bmr014_822	b	No . ; For security ? ; Yeah , OK good . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1263	b	Right . ; And you 'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions , ; That was , w ; Yes .
Bed012_646	b	Yeah . ; OK , that was ; OK . That makes a lot more sense to me now . ; Yep .
Btr002_901	s	That 's that 's what I do , ; OK . OK . ; yeah . ; I do it all on the keyboard .
Btr002_3253	%--	Oh ! ; Oh . ; OK . ; And what that means is at the time when we
Bro021_970	bk	the Taylor series expansion for log one plus N by X is ; is X ; Is it the first - order expansion ? ; OK .
Bmr003_1936	s	All mine ! ; Well then you have to do the web site . ; But ; You know , it 's like , it 's that simple .
Bmr009_333	b	So if I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech ; Yeah . ; and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps , ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1191	s	But you don't want to just totally excise it ; because ; um ; uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how how you excise it
Bmr001_343	b	Right . ; uh there 's I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh .
Bed013_1345	b	And then the the the miracle that we get out the intention , Go - there , happens , based on what we know about that entity , about the user , about his various beliefs , goals , desires , blah - blah - blah . ; like , ; with context and enough user information , ; yeah .
Bmr030_338	s	I suppose ? ; Uh , so that 's what you were working on , ; right ? ; Right . That 's the same software I used to get the data .
Bmr001_228	b	for nois noise cancelling . ; Um , my counter argument is is an uh uh um , a white rat . ; uh , which has th it 's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well . ; Oh .
Bro018_629	no	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So . ; But I don't know if people have done sort of careful comparisons of this on large tasks or anything .
Bmr019_914	s	I don't think that was the new version . ; Um ; That ; Yeah , actually it wasn't the new new ,
Bmr005_481	b	Yeah . ; and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1075	s	And that we know , I mean , we have that . ; And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged . ; Yeah . ; That 's not completely negligible .
Bmr016_500	s	which are detached digits , ; but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . ; Like " wonderful " has " one " in it ; and and Victor Borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits .
Bmr014_1036	b	Well , I mean it ; The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said . ; I ; Yeah .
Bro013_425	x	Yeah . ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr019_990	s	Right . ; But the other thing that ; I I hadn't thought about this , ; but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially ,
Bro014_614	s	They may not be the same thing . ; Right ? ; You should do both ; and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline .
Bed013_1025	s	because that 's what the person is thinking about . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way ,
Bmr028_948	b	In other words , if you d ; No . It 's No . It 's even simpler thing than that , is just that you don't know . ; You mean you do you don't do all those normalizations . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2318	ba	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; More similar than to " so " I think . ; Yeah , that 's interesting .
Btr001_2044	bh	Mm - hmm . ; Also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds . ; Yeah . ; Oh ?
Bmr019_512	bk	And tha ; And that 's what we were getting those numbers from . ; Yes . ; Right .
Bmr025_369	s	Ju ; Oh . ; Oh sorry , next month . ; June . June . June .
Bmr029_863	s	Say this again ? ; Sorry I missed it . ; So i in Th - the problem is that if we proceed like we just described , um , when he goes to m um , create the new s training data with his processing , he throws out some speakers . ; So the t two training sets won't be identical .
Bed002_684	%--	you know ? ; But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . ; Right . ; So , um , this is exactly what
Bro024_1930	bk	I wi I I will do that next week . ; Yeah , ; that 's that 's ; Right .
Bdb001_1251	%--	Uh , ; so , ; Yep . ; um , if you had a more
Bmr029_329	%--	Right ? ; I mean , a lot of the evaluations have been ; We have MR ; two , th We have two , three , four , fi
Bmr019_1958	ar	No ? ; No ? ; Synchronized digits . ; No .
Bro012_1216	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So um that 's something that is sort of finer , ; brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction .
Bro014_581	%--	see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch . ; So just just for example . ; So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there ; and if it gets an unambiguous
Bro017_1129	b	Wh - yeah , when the data matches that , then you get really ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1344	s	Right . ; You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it . ; Right . ; And that 's about all you can do .
Bro004_190	s	Uh So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data um or number ; so , ; the the ratio of ; our error rates uh with the baseline error rate is around uh one point one .
Bmr019_54	no	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Have Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of in more of the meeting ? ; I I mean , I don't know ,
Bro019_1352	b	some improvement on the noisy speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Some small vocabulary tasks . ; Uh .
Bns001_705	s	Also they use , in principle , the same uh the same mechanism . ; Mm - hmm . ; But you also have a dat uh packet oriented communication that 's on the GPS stuff . ; And that 's also related to UMTS .
Bmr007_577	bk	Yeah . ; I ju I I think that in this meeting I really had the feeling that wasn't happening , that the hostile hostile type . ; These were these were benevolent types , as people finishing each other 's sentences , and stuff . ; OK .
Btr002_1231	s	And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected . ; Mm - hmm . ; Same with " six " . ; The " X " , well the " KS " or whatever , at the end .
Bmr022_277	ba	Yeah , we can , ; yeah , like , do do , uh , one for each ca one for each person in the meeting , you can only hire people who have perfect pitch , ; and they can say " A - flat " " B " . ; Well . Well ,
Bro024_1933	b	Right . ; In fact , actually I g I guess the , uh the Spanish government , uh , requires that anyway . ; They want some kind of report from everybody who 's in the program . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1364	s	I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it , ; which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts . ; u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting . ; You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said .
Bmr019_995	s	When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually very often in w well , I won't say " usually " but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel w which was the person who had asked a question . ; S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? " ; And then there would be backchannels , ; but it would be the person who asked the question .
Bed009_734	%--	and a segmentation occurs . ; So , the um ; um ; So the idea is to uh have a pa y y a particular
Bmr006_757	s	Oh well . ; I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones ; because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . It 's a sup supervised and , eh , hierarchical clustering process . ; I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong .
Bmr026_316	b	We 're We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . ; So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , ; but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . ; Yeah .
Bed005_726	b	and y and you can ask for it . ; All those things . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_511	bk	And then you can move on to the uh uh more pitch related stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I think this is a good idea . ; OK .
Bmr011_252	s	But ; but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform . ; Great , great . ; So I think just do a field trip at some point .
Bed005_1482	no	So we could do that . ; And maybe that 's what we 'll do . ; But , um ; don't know .
Bmr001_520	s	Yeah . ; cuz we 're only we 're only ; how many mikes are we recording right now ? ; Well , right now we don't have any choice .
Bmr003_829	no	I 'm alright . ; Um , i it seems like ; Well , ; uh , I don't know .
Bmr012_1381	s	What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . ; To try to do something about that . ; So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , ; s looking into the theory behind that
Bmr028_594	s	Do that . ; Yeah . ; See what the length distribution is . ; Yeah . But but y there 's there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second .
Bmr027_1254	b	See , if I had that little scratch - pad , I would have made an X there . ; Thank you , thank you . ; Uh , well , we 'll give you one then . ; Yeah .
Bed012_92	s	in terms of if if we 're only asking about one of the ; So like , if I 'm just interested in the going - there node , I would just pull that information out of the Struct that gets return that would that Java Bayes would output ? ; Um , pretty much , yes , ; but I think it 's a little bit more complex .
Bmr023_461	bd	Did you record it ? ; No . ; For all the Meeting Recorder data . ; We should have .
Bmr013_619	b	No , actually it 's a different meeting . ; Good . ; So , um , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . ; OK .
Bmr005_956	aa	Like how many ; That was about ten hours , and there was about ; t ten It 's like ten meetings or something ? ; Yeah , something like that .
Btr002_3335	%--	Can I ask one more thing about these comments . ; I really appreciate this . ; Yes ? ; So we are for
Bmr005_51	%--	Uh - huh . Yeah . ; You mean that as an event also . ; So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that ; To
Bro014_262	%--	I mean , it it seems like there 's a simple way ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , this seems like an obvious mistake or something . ; Th - they 're
Bro023_968	aa	right ? ; Instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it . ; If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction in that . ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_1357	s	So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um ; I mean , he gets incredibly good results if you artificially reverberate clean you know , close close - miked data .
Bed003_87	bk	Very nice . ; Is that better ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro007_465	s	Uh the clean training stuff . ; OK . ; Mmm . ; Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days
Bed013_1150	b	e which tells us how far the user how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity . ; OK . ; So you 're talking about , for instance , the construction obviously involves this entity or refers refers to this entity , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_847	s	It 's probably like inaudible for us ; but ; And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause . ; I don't is it That doesn't make any sense ,
Bmr001_790	b	um so you know in in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Wow . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_894	b	Oh , OK . ; But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last . ; So you don't wa you don't wanna put ir un reproduceable data on them . ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_726	qw	but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power , ; but in a training what you c in a training uh in trained model , all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant . ; Uh - huh . ; But why if you 're if you 're multi if you 're altering the model , why w in the test data , why would you have to muck with the uh cepstral coefficients ?
Bed016_278	aa	Ah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sounds like Fey . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1287	s	To carry on doing it ? ; What Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p ; So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . ; He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement .
Bmr021_343	s	So the program 's called W - encode . ; Mmm . ; And I think the type , y you say um I think dash T ; and then there are different different encoding methods ,
Bmr007_984	s	So you always have this problem , you 're going to new data ; um H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ? ; And I think that 's a problem with this . ; Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes .
Bns001_109	s	especially because uh , until not so long uh , the the things were too heavy to have a computer , a wireless transceiver , on a more or less portable thing . ; So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing , in the market . ; And , eh , well this is more or less what I have done . ; And the kind of , uh , things , I 'm interested is more or less all , around this these kind of networks .
Bmr010_358	s	I mean , basically he 's he 's on it now . ; Yeah . ; Oh , that 's ; So so so this is so i it 'll happen .
Bro004_1192	%--	so that it doesn't introduce uh , any more delay . ; I it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay ; but at the same time the LDA down here ; I don't know Wh
Bmr005_593	s	Yeah . ; Do you ; The the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I I I want to use to to nnn , eh to put ; i i it 's a reference for me .
Bed005_984	s	Yeah . ; You can put the microphone in your pocket . ; Hey ! ; I was envying you and your pocket
Bmr010_212	s	Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features . ; So you have these twenty - four features . ; Yeah . ; Uh , a lot of them are spectral features .
Bmr031_1516	b	What kinds of what what makes sense to do with that feature ? ; Well , I 'll have to hear what he 's using , f given different suggestions he 's gotten . ; So . ; i Yeah .
Bed013_91	b	and B , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions , ; That 's good . ; you know , when they say " X " , and there is a ride at the goal , and the parking is good , we can never collect enough data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_336	s	Mm - hmm . ; Or whatever it whatever that might be . ; So that 's under that model ; then , There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query ,
Bed005_1012	%--	Yeah . ; Enter , V View , Approach , right ? ; W what was this ? ; It i i i ehhh , i ehhh .
Bed009_889	%--	Yeah th the information is available . ; OK . ; I see . ; So , but
Bmr011_786	s	which is what we were thinking . ; or ; Yep . ; It 's well in the range .
Bmr019_203	s	So , one so there were a number of things we noted from this . ; One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK ; Hmm . ; this , you know , very limited training HTK system .
Bro010_11	h	Yesterday ; Uh ; Yesterday morning on video conference . ; Uh ,
Bmr022_939	%	OK , so whatever people sort of wear to use l ; This one . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1370	aa	It works . ; Yeah . ; Well , it 's it 's a good paper , I mean ; Yeah .
Bed010_112	qw	So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , ; and then magically it sort of s ; Yeah ; I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?
Bed014_621	2	We don't have a connectionist implementation . ; No , I mean ; Now Now my guess is that it 's not a question of time but it is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned . ; Yeah , relevance .
Bed002_40	bk	Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about stuff before everyone 's here . ; Mmm . ; Well , we have one more coming . ; OK .
Bmr015_685	b	but , eh , ; Yeah . ; I I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , after the the last experience . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Buw001_1404	b	in some cases . ; But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information . ; I think " important " can often be uninteresting . ; Mmm .
Bed003_155	aa	But if you looked at it real close , you could see the the in intricacy of the of the walls . ; OK . ; So that count as counts as a nice wall . ; Right .
Bmr022_135	b	And , uh ; Well , the only other issue is we 'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order . ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bro024_506	s	Yeah , I think what is important to see is that there is a big difference between the training modes . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; If you have clean training , you get also a fifty percent improvement .
Bns003_265	s	Yeah . ; It is . ; you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU , ; So there are some gaps .
Bro016_131	b	but I think it would be it 'd be good to know that . ; OK . ; I just need to get , um , front - end , uh , stuff from you ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1194	b	We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . ; I 'm using one of these . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_377	g	I had a question about the system the SRI system . ; So , you trained it on TI - digits ? ; But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . ; Right ?
Bmr031_686	ba	And we 've got several ; we ' v we 've still got , uh , quite a bit of space on the , uh , un - backed - up . ; So . ; Good .
Bmr003_1575	bk	But I thought it would be you know , I I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed ; but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . ; And , uh ; OK ,
Bed015_646	aa	Does that Is that really what they mean in in ; FrameNet ? ; I didn't know that . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed006_962	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; OK . ; I mean personally , I 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have X forms , which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the SPG action up there is Enter , then the goal type can never be a statue .
Bro025_80	b	anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback ; and , uh , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . ; But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2783	bk	Yeah , ; you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence . ; What do they say , ; OK .
Bed011_498	bk	all of these d do have this kind of " tour " um aspect about the way you would go to them . ; And uh , the movie theater is probably also uh e is a " attend " et cetera . ; Attend , ; yeah .
Btr001_87	b	They just glide over some of the letters . ; They don't fully pronounce them . ; So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times @ @ what it is . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_1273	bk	Anything else ? ; Nah . ; Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour . ; OK .
Bro028_964	s	So th he uses analysis functions called Gabor functions , ; um , which have a certain extent , um , in time and in frequency . ; And the idea is these are used to sample , um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . ; So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane .
Bro014_1121	t3	I I don't know really know the signal - processing well enough to understand what what is that doing . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1161	s	So , I mean , for today , for instance , ; and ; this is the second meeting recorded today . ; The first meeting was a was a front - end meeting ,
Bmr019_719	s	Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . ; And we also ; There was some neat or , interesting cases , ; like there 's one meeting where , um , Jose 's giving a presentation
Bmr006_381	s	Here . ; I mean , that 's that 's ; OK , so ; We 're set up for it .
Bro026_9	bk	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's it 's it was updated yesterday , ; Cool .
Bed003_703	bk	Business on the other hand is , uh , definitely what you 're doing . ; So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT ; So i wi th ; OK .
Bro016_1088	s	Versus an acoustic event , which is just some something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure . ; Um . So it 's , um it 's a little different , ; in at least in my mind . ; I mean , when we did the SPAM work I mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ auditory event .
Bro011_296	%--	Hmm . ; Oh the What we talked about yesterday ? ; Yes . ; Yeah that was actually my
Bro018_712	b	but people have used it for speech recognition , and they have gotten probabilities . ; So they have some conversion from these distances to probabilities . ; OK . ; Right , yeah .
Bmr016_1919	%--	Interesting question . ; There 's a ; Yes . ; OK , now first of all
Bed005_470	s	Uh ; Well , it just automatically initializes things that are common , right ? ; it ; So it 's just a shorthand .
Bed012_906	h	Or , something in Mandarin , yeah . ; Or Cantonese , as the case may be . ; What do you think about that , Bhaskara ? ; I mean
Bmr020_383	b	Right . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1899	s	He 's switching to other stuff again . ; Yeah . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . ; So , I 'll I 'll send him email . ; I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it .
Btr001_1274	b	Yeah , exactly . ; Well , they 're not linguists , ; if ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_389	aa	then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins uh across the ribbons ; uh you could have ; And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ? ; Yes .
Bro018_616	b	So rather than doing nearest neighbor where you compare to every single one , you just pick a few critical ones , ; and ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro005_99	s	Uh . ; Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . ; Uh , so this is training the net on French only , ; or on English only ,
Bns001_1163	bk	Yeah , that 's right . ; and nobody is has the skills to deal with that . ; And then we are leaving our scope anyway . ; OK .
Bed009_1077	s	Mm - hmm . ; And ; Nancy is going to ; Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .
Bmr005_628	bk	I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane , ; Oh , OK . ; OK . ; Oh , I see .
Buw001_821	s	because once it 's gone it 's gone . ; And ; I 'm just The community ; If LDC collects this data u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there .
Bed006_1266	b	So I guess what 's the function of having it up there too ? ; I mean I guess I 'm wondering whether You could just have ; under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it 's gonna be Enter , View or Approach or whatever number of things ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_575	aa	well , if we don't have an anything else to discuss , we should , uh , turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things . ; Should we do digits first ? ; Oh , yeah , digits . ; Oh yeah , digits !
Bmr003_2523	ba	Yeah . ; and they said , " sure , ; whenever you want " . ; So I think it won't be a problem .
Bns001_903	s	And that we use this application , in principle , while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things . ; When you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium , or as a partner whatever , who provides this service . ; And then we we are playing videos , in principle , if you have a field trial . ; And that is , I think , much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the University ,
Bns003_915	aa	L Lan ; Landay ? ; Rao , right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_293	s	So I think , certainly , doing two beeps is is no - brainer . ; Yeah . ; And then the other question is , if they can ; If they do something on a computer in a format we can handle , we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker ID and beeps already in it .
Bro028_190	g	Yeah . The next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data . ; Um ; So , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources . ; Right ?
Bed014_952	bk	So we just knew i ; So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' ; No , he can . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr014_660	%--	And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . ; And that way each person only has to remember one password . ; I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . ; I mean if people have
Bmr009_1544	s	And we want to plot that , instead of the whole wave form . ; I mean . ; Yeah . ; That might be faster .
Bro003_1453	s	right ? ; And you 're going through them all . ; Mm - hmm . ; That that 's what I meant .
Btr001_151	aa	I can't remember . ; I mean he 's e ; he he said that they were designed for a specific sized head ? ; Ah , yeah .
Btr001_714	b	Mm - hmm . ; It doesn't hurt to have a pad . ; It 's it 's nicer to have a pad than not , ; Yeah .
Bed017_559	aa	Remember the uh , Prashant story ? ; Right . ; The absolutely no no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here . ; Right .
Bro012_842	b	uh and and in some , there was low light , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2938	b	Yeah . ; I agree . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_990	ba	Otherwise , you 're just accessing ; This is all just temporary access , ; so I don't I think it 's all just ; It 's fine .
Bmr016_488	s	So . ; Can try it out . ; If we have nothing if we have no agenda we could do it some week . ; See see what Dan thinks .
Bro016_814	aa	And so th the , uh for the tandem system , the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid . ; Right ? ; They 're sort of the pre - nonlinearity values ? ; Right .
Bro028_263	s	Yeah . Maybe you just put in some other noise , ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; something that 's different . ; I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there .
Bro012_553	qw	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Uh , so . ; Um . What I was asking , though , is uh are what 's what 's the level of communication with uh the O G I gang now , about this
Bmr026_468	co	Just press Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " " this week " . ; The " more disk space " button ? ; Yep . ; Skip the rest of the conversation .
Bns001_615	aa	I think that that the leader was uh Professor Katz . ; And then ; OK . ; That 's right .
Bed009_899	%--	oh yeah . ; We have knowledge bases from from Verbmobil system we can use ; Yep . ; and so .
Bro012_927	s	And , well , it 's better with variance normalization . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So it does get better even though it looks ugly .
Bmr028_43	ba	except it 's even slower to load . ; It 's already pretty slow to load . ; Yeah . It 's more segments ? ; Yeah . It 's slow .
Bro017_1279	b	I I can check on that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed014_611	%--	um ; It would already be higher in the context . ; th that th the the the conditional probability that someone ; So at the time you mentioned it
Bmr009_693	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; This was sort of where where we were last week .
Bmr023_1018	b	so @ @ in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs ; and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_530	qw	Mmm . ; So we 'll have to think about ; So ; how much is that used in German ?
Bmr011_919	b	But there could be problems , right ? with that . ; Yep . ; I think it would be difficult to do it that way . I really ; Yeah .
Bro003_1484	bk	Yeah , ; I mean , my point ; I I want to ; Yeah ,
Bed006_372	s	Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so ; th the q first question for the subject is , " so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do .
Bmr008_1367	2	You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something , uh that that there would be more of a distinction . ; Nnn . ; Yeah . ; The different zone .
Bro023_1534	b	Sixty - four milliseconds is to compute the FFT , uh , bins . ; The the FFT . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bro026_360	s	Yeah . ; And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things . ; Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth ; but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things .
Bns001_285	b	like five hundred feet , or or even more sometimes . ; so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network . ; You can switch from UMTS or uh uh , to WaveLAN Technologies . ; Hmm .
Bmr009_530	s	No , no . ; I I I I ; Well , we certainly should see this but I I I I think that the harm ; I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things
Bro014_157	ba	uh , I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 'll it really increases what we can run on . ; Hmm . Cool .
Bmr023_1207	bk	I I , uh , missed what you said . ; Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr019_457	s	Yeah . ; Digits . ; Adaptation . ; Uh , adaptation , non - adaptation ,
Bmr012_886	bk	Oh . ; Right . ; And it gets downsampled to sixteen . ; OK .
Bed005_532	s	and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes , ; route elements , ; and , again , as we thought it 's really simple . ; This is sort of the , uh , um , parameters .
Bro018_727	aa	yeah , ; So in your in in the thing that you 're doing , uh you have a vector of ones and zeros for each phone ? ; our ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1385	s	and then uh hopefully I get some results . ; So it it 's a it 's a project goes over the course of one semester . ; Great . ; So I 'm just here today to introduce myself .
Bns001_1474	s	Real technology . ; Maybe you can start with GPS or or UMTS , or whatever . ; because these technology will definitely available in Europe . ; There 's some money spent on it ,
Bmr010_1037	s	I think ; We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything . ; And I 'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool . ; I mean , if , uh so I I told them that , um , we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month
Bro024_893	aa	Oh . ; Yep . ; C - z C - zero and log energy also , ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1541	b	but ; OK . ; so you can't absolutely count on it . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_223	aa	So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones ? ; And I 'm ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro017_1239	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr001_586	s	These theories things are pretty amazing . ; Yeah . ; And And there 's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be ; It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine ,
Bmr027_477	%--	Well . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , I 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . ; And how many people ?
Bed002_437	bk	And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . ; So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , " whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . ; Ask them which one you want . " ; OK .
Bmr020_1298	ba	I 'm I 'm open to that , ; it was ; Yeah , if it 's working well , ; that sounds like a good idea
Bro010_178	b	What 's the allowable ? ; Two - fifty , ; unless they changed the rules . ; Hmm .
Bmr026_881	%	Mm - hmm . ; Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better . ; I could also put in uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_259	b	and this was one of them that was kind of funny . ; Um but I I I what I take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro010_921	%--	um , this issue of where the targets come from . ; So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , uh , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there ; Mm - hmm . ; and we say , " OK , we train every "
Bed002_1184	s	No . ; and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something . ; Sure . ; And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem .
Bed008_4	%--	OK . ; Piece of paper ? I could borrow ? ; Oh yeah . ; OK , so uh i um
Bro004_1154	g	Yeah . ; But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bmr013_426	s	so it should be something broader . ; But , The but uh where I 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , um , uh , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature . ; OK . ; And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this .
Bed015_1016	s	Now we 'll go back to s ; OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , ; which is , um , the discourse situation context record , ; right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line
Bns003_733	t3	it 's not sure , ; Hmm ? No , ; not really sure . ; there .
Bro014_895	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And , ; uh ; Yeah . Hopefully , I think what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,
Btr002_574	b	You don't hear the full the full band of frequencies . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Right .
Bed005_979	%--	Or shall I just use this ? ; squealing sound ? ; It 's probably just as easy . ; I
Bmr016_1142	s	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Exactly ! Exactly ! ; Alright so , a spelling check first ; then an exhaustive listing of the , uh all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached ; and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas .
Bmr027_829	bd	It 's like certified mail . ; Could do that . ; Right . ; But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it .
Bro026_512	s	I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , ; uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal .
Btr001_2730	aa	So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that . ; But in the transcriptions I mean , we don't have to deal with that ; because when the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever . ; No .
Bsr001_1975	b	yeah , but but eventually I mean , will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know , and and and in core technology . ; So I mean , recognition technology and also core , you know , algorithms , et cetera . ; And for those people to have these data will be , you know , the best way to , you know , develop the systems to an @ @ . ; Right .
Bmr003_1763	bk	Hmm . ; But , a lot of these issues , I think that for uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . ; Sure . ; I know .
Bed002_1075	s	or that are in the program language Java ? ; No , th It turns out that there is a , uh The new end of Java libraries . ; OK , and it turns out one called ; Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount .
Bro022_495	bs	to normalize . ; But that , um , didn't work either . ; See , we have a different interpretation of this . ; He says it doesn't work .
Bmr020_1170	bk	The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it . ; So . ; Well , it ; OK .
Bro017_1030	b	And two gigs of memory . ; That 's right . ; because then y you just write the " do " - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_142	aap	That that bud ? ; It doesn't have to go in her ear . ; Right ? ; Uh , no . It doesn't have to ,
Bed006_500	s	There is a d ; Isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that ? ; Finals was that . ; Yeah w it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students
Bmr012_1299	%--	Um that 's a great idea . ; Great . ; Super . ; I 'm really sorry I have to g
Bed008_659	s	Yeah . ; And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also ; OK . ; Budget .
Bro023_1482	s	Oh , OK . ; Which ; But this is ten frames plus plus ; Channel zero dropping .
Bro021_16	s	Let 's see , maybe we should just get a list of items ; things that we should talk about . ; Um , ; I guess there 's the usual updates ,
Bro005_1214	s	But my impression was that uh , there was a a a a strict constraint on the delay , ; Yeah . ; but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , ; and using less CPU was better .
Bed004_507	s	Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place ; and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " . ; So this is just based on this one um , on this one feature , ; and that 's that 's about all you can do .
Bro017_694	s	Yeah . ; And then these exponents are just applied to that ; Absolutely . ; And hev everything is fixed .
Bmr006_731	b	Yeah , fans . ; This is like a ground level , with It 's not it 's not total silence . ; Eh , I I mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_298	s	And , this can be a a potential uh um you know , uh , income , too . ; Yeah . ; Because you just have to license , uh uh WaveLAN technology . ; You can build , uh , the whole thing .
Bmr011_1042	b	No , th Yeah . No . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , ; and they ; They were not ; Mmm .
Bns001_1691	b	And there 's a We m ; But anyway you ; Our group might fo want to focus on the uh IP over ether no nets ; yeah ?
Bed003_1221	s	and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And um let 's make those four .
Bed011_837	b	But well , this is my first guess , ; I mean y ; in much the same way as how how d you know should the route be ? ; Yeah .
Bro019_65	%--	Do we have anything like an agenda ? ; What 's going on ? ; Um . ; I guess
Bmr028_449	%--	And so , uh , I have a I sent out yet another this morning , which I think makes six total emails that I 've sent to these people , ; and so I think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them . ; Um Right . ; Stalk them @ @ at their
Btr002_2024	b	I tends I you know what I noticed , is it tends to have a still , a dominant group of speakers ; Sometimes . ; and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all ; Mmm .
Bro010_652	b	right ? ; if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1540	%--	I don't know anything about re - synthesis . ; Uh , how likely do you think that is ? ; Uh , it depends what you what you do . ; I mean , it 's it 's it 's , uh ,
Bro027_425	%--	What was it using before ? ; Before it was just P L ; So . ; Yeah , it was actually
Bro027_368	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; Because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for Linux and all those . ; Yep .
Bmr018_1626	2	Right . ; that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about , ; and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way , ; Machine - learning .
Bmr003_255	br	u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ? ; and so we will ; Yes . ; Excuse me ?
Btr001_740	d	Nice . ; I don't have so much problem at the beginning , ; but . ; Of breath or of uh nothing ?
Bed005_975	aa	should I Is there a white board here that I can use ? ; Yeah . You could ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bed008_1534	s	fifty constructions or whatever ; that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions ; and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer ; so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready .
Bmr001_799	b	Then we 'll go from there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript , if the near field mike does a reasonably good job ? ; Hmm .
Btr002_2463	s	Mm - hmm . ; The It seems like the computer science people use " lipsmack " for that . ; I Personally , my choice ; eh , w we 've we 're still deciding on how we 're gonna encode it in the final version .
Btr001_2026	b	and you 're just going , " No , ; Yeah . ; I don't understand . " ; U no .
Bed005_338	aa	That 'd be great . ; It would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run . ; See th ; Mm - hmm . Yep .
Buw001_2201	s	I ; I really liked the idea of ; what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . ; Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking .
Bed005_710	s	but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions , ; and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed
Bed011_178	s	So , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level Um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here ; let 's go to our favorite endpoint one ; is again more or less we have um ; then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth .
Bro019_1223	ar	Uh , no . ; Oh . ; Or anything . ; No
Bed005_465	s	Yeah , each is ; When it ; S so that 's funny . ; You bury the s the state in the function
Bro026_855	aa	And you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related . ; And you create a tree . ; And ; y yeah , yeah ,
Bmr028_827	b	Or if uh , you know , in the future , if Linux machines become like way cheaper , than , uh , you know , Solaris machines , then you know , that wouldn't be a reason not to use Linux anymore . ; Yep . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1889	%--	He should be allowed to to , you know , w do it . ; I know , I know . ; I know , ; but that but , I
Bmr016_1002	s	Yeah and they don't . ; Two gig ? ; So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth . ; You can't load an hour of speech into X Waves .
Bed003_639	b	Over and over again . ; So . ; We couldn't we couldn't figure out how to turn it off of " Tango " . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr015_1213	%--	so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . ; Uh - huh . ; I see . ; One of the
Btr002_508	b	Yeah . ; I mean s it 's very useful . ; If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um , ; Yes .
Bns002_29	bk	Yeah , yeah . ; Like this one . ; Yeah . ; Ah ,
Bmr007_1273	b	Shoot . ; It 's great . ; Oh well . ; Yeah .
Bed011_717	bk	Mmm g that 's good . ; Um . ; Put it in . ; Bicycles c should be in there ,
Bed015_676	s	So I d don't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it . ; It might be ; it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require ; you know , these things are like it 's semantically part of it
Bro014_203	no	and then they split it to the individuals . ; And so , it may be that that 's what 's happening here . ; I I I have to look it up and see . ; I I don't exactly remember .
Bro025_341	bk	Pardon ? ; There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ? ; Oh , no . It actually made it , like , point one percent better or something , actually . ; OK .
Bed006_964	b	OK . ; I mean personally , I 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have X forms , which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the SPG action up there is Enter , then the goal type can never be a statue . ; Uh - huh . ; Right .
Bro015_216	s	Uh . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it 's was playing with the number of states per word . ; They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen .
Bns002_965	s	That 's OK . ; And to and to get the maximum network throughput . ; That ; That 's that 's the idea .
Bed016_172	bk	Sorry . ; current formalism thing that you presented . ; OK . I will . ; OK . OK .
Bed003_1497	s	Like German trains are really great ; so . ; But you know , I don't know whether it 's which ones are safer , you know , statistically . ; Um , but they 're faster .
Bro026_461	s	So with this , uh , new stream would you train up a VAD on both both features , somehow ? ; No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features . ; OK . ; I mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams .
Bro007_255	g	Mm - hmm ? ; So uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word , ; Yeah . ; right ?
Bmr024_865	b	Yeah . ; It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci ; It 's the back - up system . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1260	s	you know , slightly different ; What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this , ; Yeah . ; um , she , um , i i i indicated that that you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis .
Bed015_1445	s	I think two O 's , ; yes , TH . ; OK . ; I never know how to pronounce his name
Bro010_859	%--	then he has each of these AND things . ; And , ; um , ; but
Bro008_98	s	where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate . ; Oh , ; OK . ; And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that .
Bmr020_1895	s	alright . ; OK . ; Let 's do digits . ; Digits .
Bmr003_1205	aa	And also we would have control of I mean , we could give them feedback . ; Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount . ; Mmm . ; Yep , yep .
Btr001_1779	s	but yeah . ; Have you noticed that Tiger ; I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a cough . ; It should be " clear throat " , or something .
Bmr024_966	bk	So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ? ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Oh .
Bro026_48	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; And , uh and and I guess actually , uh , after Eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . ; So , actually everybody who 's working on it will be up there for at least a little while .
Bed013_875	co	So what are what ; Was wollte der Kuenstler uns damit sagen ? ; So , ; Stop excluding me .
Bmr031_282	bk	Yeah . ; Just from word choice ? ; and ; Right .
Bro014_883	b	Yeah . ; It seems quite robust to noise , ; so when we take we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_383	2	OK . ; So . So it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely . ; So there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready I think . ; Determined .
Bns001_1140	s	c Can I do another one , like ; UMTS or wireless u i generally are will be m more expensive . ; And especially UMTS . ; If they want to get back the money .
Bmr028_783	s	f r ; It 's both . ; There 's a there 's an input stream and an output stream . ; Input reader and an output stream .
Bed002_125	bk	Right . ; Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly ; your give give your e normal schpiel . ; OK .
Bed003_210	aa	Uh . ; So , a big flat structure . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bro028_616	s	Because I I thought I remembered hearing that some sites were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff at their place , ; No . ; Mmm . ; so there was some talk about having Mississippi State run the systems for them .
Bro010_448	%--	" Let 's let 's separate that out . " ; And so , ; uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday ; and ,
Bmr031_1234	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . I built a few built a few houses . ; Um , ; but right now I guess , uh , I 'm working on this paper this ISCA paper for this workshop that Liz and Andreas and I are putting together .
Bro024_469	s	Uh . Hhh . ; Let 's see . ; So we 've got forty minutes left , ; and it seems like there 's a lot of material .
Bmr010_275	b	Under Windows . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm not sure if if if we can use it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1686	bk	Uh , ; so w we can say what we 're doing , ; yeah . ; OK .
Bro019_1283	s	Yeah . ; What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that . ; Mm - hmm . ; That is just a binary feature
Btr001_909	s	Mmm , oh right . ; Uh - huh . ; You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is . ; I always get confused with the pronunciation convention .
Bed013_321	%--	That 's approaching . ; He 's coming back when ? ; Uh next ; Well , I think we think we 'll see him definitely on Tuesday for the next
Bed003_1369	s	now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , ; and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , ; what happens is you know the parser parses it ; and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules .
Bed015_1098	s	Right . ; So I so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? ; Everything else here is utterance - specific . ; Um , and I left the slot , " predications " , open
Btr001_1540	b	Mmm . ; but it took a really long time and I 'd get frustrated with it . ; And I think that I would lose my ; Yeah .
Buw001_855	%--	I mean , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , ; and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . ; s ; Uh , except in
Bmr008_464	qw	and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English . ; And then following that , a characterization of of region . ; Now , we discussed maybe indicating a t a time frame . ; So , " Where did you live during your , you know , childhood and adolescence ? "
Bns003_779	s	They have now a PHD . ; It is settled , ; and my other next , uh , generation of contract is also going in that sense so the topic is still going go going on . ; and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer , a bigger project um , outside of this goal , with contributions here from , uh first of all from the NSA group and then from from other partners .
Bed006_87	b	OK . OK . ; You could do it about you . ; Well I didn't know . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1670	bk	So . ; Yeah . ; Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is is is , uh , put it into another neural net . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro012_1531	aa	So . I just thought that was a interesting thing about the data . ; OK . ; So we 're gonna read some more digit strings I guess ? ; Yeah .
Bro010_447	s	e the argument was " let 's not have that be part of this test . " ; " Let 's let 's separate that out . " ; And so , ; uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday
Bmr006_48	s	uh Yeah . ; And what 's he interested in , specifically ? ; So ; he 's comes from a signal - processing background ,
Bmr005_1155	s	Um ; but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . ; She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . ; I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say .
Bed009_483	x	right ? ; uh together with the usual gang , ; um Petra and Jan ; Mmm .
Bmr003_259	s	Audio D V ; Well , or something . ; Yeah , audio D V ; C Ds ,
Bro007_64	s	For the f the f first yellow line you mean ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ; so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .
Bed015_1069	s	And and these could actually just point to , you know , the the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? ; So , um , ; uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . ; I almost listed " discourse status " as a slot where you could say it 's active .
Bmr031_535	bd	Yeah . They were g they said they were gonna record @ @ ; aren't they ? ; They 're recording all of them . ; I don't know if there were fifty ,
Bmr003_1316	aa	Th - this is the French software , right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bro018_768	b	Yeah , ; and um cuz the uh ; So King and and Taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets , ; Yeah .
Bmr030_19	s	And the other condition is that they have to get a budget out , like , immediately , ; or the or they 'll give the money to someone else . ; By next Friday . ; So Morgan 's working on that .
Bed004_754	%--	So maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part , ; Oh , OK . ; Uh . ; then .
Bmr027_825	bd	Oh , that 's interesting . ; So ; You you can ; A lot of mailers support return receipt .
Bro007_509	aa	three three A - three PM ? ; No , we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to ; eh I don't know if it 's three PM it 's ; Oh yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bsr001_2448	s	Yeah , ; it 's TI - digit strings . ; I don't ; M that sorta thing .
Btr001_2565	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed008_1492	bk	Hmm , I guess not . ; Yeah , that 's ; No . ; Right .
Bed003_1099	s	Yeah . ; I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability ; so this is probably ; The other thing is it is in Java
Bro015_82	%--	Um . Yeah , basically that 's all . ; We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work so we 've not much more results . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah you have a uh you have a lunch talk sometime in
Bsr001_1495	s	and ; So if ; Yeah . ; You 're double miking everyone ,
Bmr029_591	bd	So that by the middle of the week we had s had some kind of result . ; I mean , it 's it 's one of these Hail Mary kinds of things . ; I mean , it ; it , uh might might not work out .
Bed014_1161	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , we 've talked a little bit about that , too , ; which ; uh , uh , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one ,
Btr002_2325	s	Indecipherable . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off ,
Bro027_226	b	So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything . ; So , ; um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_47	aa	And you think we th uh , ; I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right , ; but you think we 'll be able to retrieve the other hour , reasonably ? ; Yes , absolutely .
Bmr018_994	x	is it worth ; if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time . ; Well , I 'm thinking ; are you talking about for a paper , or are talking about for the corpus .
Bmr012_992	%--	And so w I think if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards , ; and then you have the synchronization issue . ; But that 's a question because that would ; if it was possible cuz it is i
Bns003_715	b	But it is not , uh , something your teacher provides you some research papers and you , let 's say , build a simulator or try to . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_831	%	There the first the first half . ; And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr012_242	%	So you guys know . ; S sorry I haven't seen the email , ; Yeah . ; Th - the
Bmr023_183	aa	Anyway . Yeah . ; Good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_444	b	No . ; And actually we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models ; That 's amazing . ; OK .
Bmr003_2000	ar	I don't think we should say , " oh , it 's internal ; therefore we don't have to make it very good " . ; I mean , you can say " oh oh , it 's internal ; No .
Bsr001_1705	b	The microphones are different ? ; You mean , uh , bu to combining the the posteriors on full band recognition like from from three different or four different mikes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_851	aa	Well , it 's a good thing that ; OK , I think we 're losing , Don and Andreas at three - thirty , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bro017_629	s	computes the mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and uh i i i ; but it 's the mean is an exponent of the whatever , the the this Gaussian function .
Bmr031_1014	bk	Well , why don't we d we we deliberately pick two people to ; I mean , people could , like , backchannel ; and ask questions and stuff . ; Yeah .
Btr001_557	ba	like exponentially , ; um , after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel . ; Yeah , ; Oh , excellent .
Bro012_1471	b	Alright . ; Yeah . ; So it would not help . ; Yeah .
Bro003_874	2	Yeah . ; OK . ; And TIMIT 's from lots of different places . ; From TI .
Bro003_495	bk	So , when you said that you were getting the labels for TIMIT , um , are y what do you mean by that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , I 'm just I 'm just , uh , transforming them from the , um , the standard TIMIT transcriptions into into a nice long huge P - file to do training . ; Mmm .
Bmr008_1025	s	No , you got what 's the other form ? ; Uh , the other form is a modified digits form . ; uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple , ; it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language .
Bmr008_1228	s	Mm - hmm . ; So it sounds like having the facility is great , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful
Bro017_800	ba	but what you can do is that you put this particular component in and and you compress it . ; That becomes uh th gets less variance , subsequently becomes less important . ; Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not do anything with your training data ? ; That would be very bad ,
Bmr019_721	s	There was some neat or , interesting cases , ; like there 's one meeting where , um , Jose 's giving a presentation ; and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed signal " ; and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying " mixed "
Bed017_771	b	You 're good . ; Nnn . s sometimes , you know the sum is not uh less than the ; Uh , right , right . ; Right .
Bmr028_1641	ba	So , we have some part of that . ; you find in the channels , ; and ; It 's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking .
Bmr008_976	%--	Yeah . ; That 'd be OK . ; Yeah . ; Something
Btr001_595	aa	Yeah . ; And you had to mark interruptions by a slash , ; Mm - hmm , ; that 's right .
Bmr014_214	bk	SRI , ; really ? ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bns002_333	s	then you 're always exchanging RTS and non - acknowledgement packets for the RTS . ; OK . ; Two two things . ; So that 's uh that 's uh , my my problem .
Bro021_136	%--	S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero ; and much less to normalize the other coefficients . ; And , um , ; actu
Bro010_263	bk	No , ; no it was pretty quick . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bed009_782	qy	might , ; at Tuebingen I thought . ; Yeah I d I don't remember . ; was Do you know something about that ?
Bmr027_544	b	I i i em email is enough . ; I mean ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_588	ba	Yeah . ; Wow . ; Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , ; Interesting .
Bro024_1088	b	Even you have reported actually zero delay for the compression . ; I thought maybe you also have some different ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bro016_266	b	I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level , ; and we would rarely adjust them again , ; even though you could get a ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_723	bk	when you say it 's a little worse ? ; It 's like , uh , fff , fff um , ten percent relative . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr002_3094	bh	That 's OK . ; Remember that ? ; Oh , you have ? ; Yeah ?
Btr002_292	s	Mmm . ; like sometimes it 's just like , " That 'd be hard , so " . ; Right . ; You know , and but and then ofte often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say ,
Bmr016_1967	s	Good . ; And then , in here , " NUMS " , ; so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . ; It comes out as " NUMS quote dot five " .
Bed002_748	aa	you know , " I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions " , ; I I would imagine that the data would be really different . ; Um , so it 's just ; Yeah .
Bed005_706	s	OK , so this is his specialty is reference , ; Mm - hmm . ; and you know , what what are these things referring to ? ; Not only anaphora ,
Bsr001_1302	bk	I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark " I 'm talking to the computer " . ; Right . ; No , it has to be has to be error complete . ; Yeah ,
Bro016_1047	aa	Hey , Barry ? ; Uh , yeah . ; Can you give an example of an event ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1604	bk	Yeah , our Yeah , our ; Maybe the sections that are not right afte you know , after lunch when everybody 's still munching ; and ; OK .
Bmr011_1079	ba	Mm - hmm . ; But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription . ; Then a chunk , then a transcription . ; That 's great ,
Bmr009_285	b	This is I w want to point to visual things , ; But I mean they there 'll be time There 'll be overlap between the distributions , ; but the question is , " If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . " ; Yeah .
Bed009_157	s	And actually we can invite um Andreas as well . ; Uh he will be in Washington , though . ; Oh that 's true . ; He 's off off on his trip already .
Buw001_307	s	Mm - hmm . ; I actually want to say something about the note pad . ; Yeah ; So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when .
Bmr024_1508	b	Yeah . ; And so , then we switched to new boot alignments , ; which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system . ; Right .
Bro019_1418	b	Mm - hmm . ; that one might be another thing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3027	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . I put in the " X "s . ; Um , ; Excellent .
Bmr020_755	s	I mean , just basically tar them all up f I mean w for each meeting I tar them all into one tar file and G - zip them and stick them there . ; I uh , put digits in my own home directory home FTP directory , ; And so . ; but I 'll probably move them there as well .
Bed015_1241	s	I mean , how you get it may may in will often involve the discourse ; OK . ; May come from a few places . ; but but by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that .
Bro010_1076	bk	So you 'd get the word right . ; No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . ; Um , ; Oh , I see what you 're saying .
Bmr028_1103	s	Oh . ; That would solve all of our problems . ; Wow . ; Yeah . Well , I was thinking that .
Btr002_151	b	Which is interesting . ; Oh . ; And and , you know , this was a case where the timebin was off . ; Hmm .
Bmr009_696	aa	This was sort of where where we were last week . ; Yeah . ; That 's true . Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro014_89	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So , um , ; I I think m it only took something like , uh , three or four hours to do the full training , ; As opposed to ?
Btr001_166	s	it 's ; I don't know . ; I liked them . ; And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there .
Bro014_455	%--	you know , with again gentle degregra degradation , ; um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training . ; Hmm . ; So , you know , I I could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch , which is you know not compl pathological but
Bro021_254	aa	Ye ; Right ? ; Yeah . So it distort the speech . ; Right .
Buw001_716	%--	So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , ; whatever 's reasonable for us . ; Yeah . ; I think even doing something very crude
Bro025_265	bk	while their is fourteen . ; Theirs is fourteen ? ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bro003_355	s	right ? ; So that 's that 's ; I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years . ; But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone .
Bro012_291	aa	Well . Yes . ; So . ; And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_254	s	I suspect that it will also differ , depending on the type of overlap involved . ; but eh ; Yeah . ; So backchannels will be very brief
Bmr006_1285	x	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; OK . ; And you find They get peaks .
Buw001_467	s	Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem . ; Their sort of note - taking application stuff ; they 've been doing for the last couple of years , ; and I don't think anyone is still working on it .
Bmr013_115	%--	instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . ; Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some some artificial signal - to - noise ratio . ; It was just people driving around in a car . ; So , that 's that 's an indication ,
Bmr030_87	s	OK . ; Anyway . ; So , other topics I wanted to talk about are , um , the DARPA demo which , I guess , since Morgan isn't here we can't really talk about . ; I just wanted to make sure it was ready to go .
Bed014_589	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . So that 's certainly more realistic . ; I m I mean psychologically . ; Right .
Bmr011_1212	s	and , uh , assuming , uh , articulatory feature values for those those things . ; Um , obviously that 's extremely time - consuming . ; Uh ; That would be really valuable I think .
Bmr027_223	s	Mm - hmm . Good . ; if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , ; I think we should just say that ; say that , you know , i a as um , " per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth
Bed015_124	s	OK , then I don't think the , um ; at least ; Yeah . None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? ; But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope ,
Btr002_428	s	Yeah ? ; " Pss " . ; like " groups of " ; Yeah , because it 's , um , bilabial too .
Bmr005_796	b	Right , we discussed that . ; you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? ; And ; Oh .
Bmr009_457	bk	Mind if I turned that light off ? ; So . ; The flickering is annoying me . ; OK .
Bmr030_698	b	Demo and IBM , I think . ; Demo . ; Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1791	qrr	No ? ; Well , you 're saying So , uh , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? ; Yeah . ; Or some other kind of thing ?
Bns001_1712	b	um ; So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there ; and just do uh I Ps playing over radio . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_544	%--	Yeah . ; You 'd have to make a different type . ; So ; Well , if you look at it
Bed003_473	s	let me rephrase that . ; It it can take values in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um " nice walls " is binary ,
Bro024_730	b	So that 's where the biggest improvement came up . ; Not much in the well match and the medium match and TI - digits also right now . ; So this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_708	s	Hey ! ; We 've we 've thought about doing that ; but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous . ; Well , a couple things .
Bmr018_1311	ba	Yep . ; Right . ; and and and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really there 's really two recording systems . ; That 's a great idea .
Bmr006_1335	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side ; Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity .
Bro022_160	bk	Yeah . ; So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? ; And we 'll do ; Oh .
Bmr026_544	s	Mmm . ; Yep . ; One One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is ; So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .
Btr002_662	s	Right . Oh , OK . Yeah . ; uh , ; I see what you 're saying . ; a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech .
Bed010_555	aa	Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at . ; OK . ; But um , I I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for for now , ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1258	s	Um . So , um , ; without thinking about it , when I offered up my hard drive last week ; Oh , no . ; It was while I was out of town .
Bed015_1122	b	Yeah . ; um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . ; So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , " oh , some " you know , " it 's a guy ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_476	b	Yeah . ; and , ; um , might be nice , cuz we save those out already , um , to be able to do that . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_748	b	Excuse me ? ; I was just thinking we store our data on Popcorn . ; How many how many institutes can you say do that ? ; Yep .
Bed008_1318	b	What ? ; it 's X X - one voted for A ; X - two voted for V ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_635	b	It 's possible . ; Anyway . ; Well , it 's ; Hmm .
Bed013_124	ba	But , um , ; I think it 'd be fun to look at it , or into that question . ; Nnn , yeah . ; It 's a pretty strange idea .
Bro024_345	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds . ; Yeah .
Bro025_552	%--	Yeah . We can try something . ; And then see how much better it gets . ; Mm - hmm . Sure . ; If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth
Bed015_1307	s	Let 's let 's mark that . ; So we need a c ; Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . ; These are all so far these structures , especially from " path " and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots .
Bsr001_1681	bk	And just combining just doing multis ; We 're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this , um , endpointing stuff . ; Hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bed009_216	qy	Yeah . ; And so what uh uh a s you s ; let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants . ; Does he wanna go there to see it ?
Bed014_1309	b	Yeah . ; So it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to communicate this story ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_514	s	If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT . ; Well , and also ; They had divided things up into regions . ; But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English .
Bro024_639	b	Which is there in the spreadsheet . ; I 'm not changing anything in there . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bro025_573	s	eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And , um , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty ; I mean , you might , you might not .
Bed015_1301	s	but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you . ; OK . ; Except for " cause " , that I forgot . ; But anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events .
Bed009_460	s	rea ; I mean nothing 's being completely settled there ; yep ; so this is really an ongoing discussion
Bmr016_1616	s	I know what IP is . ; I 'd have to listen . ; I I I agree . ; I w I 'd like to standardize these down farther
Bed009_507	%--	for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do . ; What the user says after that is going to be very much caught up with what the action planner told it . ; Yes . ; If the If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told
Bmr006_1234	s	It - it 's not amplitude , ; right ? ; S Right . ; I mean , I know I n I know that 's a very important cue .
Bmr010_1336	b	Yeah . ; maybe that 's a better place to go . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_259	bk	uh that 's in noise also , ; right ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Oh OK .
Bed008_722	qw	Yeah . ; OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions ; um how do we do this ? ; What do I have under user state anyhow
Bed008_97	b	OK , that 's let 's start that way . ; because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance ; but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . ; Hmm .
Bro003_1610	bk	Yeah , ; and we do have ; I mean , ; yeah ,
Bmr001_599	s	You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output . ; That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it . ; Oh , it 's just not working . ; I just I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once
Bsr001_932	b	There are there are some with a lot of overlap . ; Um uh yeah , ; and they but they they do it somehow . They clean it up . ; Yeah .
Bed015_350	bk	Uh , we don't mind either , ; so ; I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of of phrase structure . ; Right .
Bmr027_1137	b	Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because the it 's not what I said " . ; OK . ; Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in , ; Yeah .
Bed008_824	s	Mm - hmm . ; So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , ; and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for ; We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint .
Bro017_996	b	Yeah . ; You you have a step where you you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition . ; It would be quick . ; Yeah .
Bro010_643	b	Yeah . ; So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_405	%--	OK . ; Yeah , and and not even all of them really do . ; Yeah . ; But like
Bmr015_398	b	uh , ; more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that . ; And and we 're in the middle ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_624	s	Like that the avatar . ; OK . ; And um . ; And then you pick pick a movie and and and it show shows you the times
Bmr023_684	aa	Mm - hmm . ; I guess you reported on some te punctuation type ; finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_787	s	OK , then , uh , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour ; and I could get the transcribers to do that ; right ; I mean , what I mean is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour ,
Bmr023_389	s	and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . ; And he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um Um . ; So they really appreciate it . ; But I was gonna say that they do adjust it once in a while .
Bed006_1143	b	but yeah I mean like ; Yeah . ; but it 's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information ; Mm - hmm , yeah .
Bmr006_607	s	One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , SPINE . ; SPINE . ; And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . ; So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data .
Bmr031_1548	%--	So ; Right . Exactly . ; And then you also have the different speakers . ; And so , the sort of question is , do you wanna average all the data together or do you do you ?
Bmr021_818	s	Good question . ; That 's fine . ; That seems really odd to me . ; Um , so , one percent I would attribute to the lack of VTL ,
Bro025_460	s	Well , you could . ; Yeah . I mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; But nobody seems to have cared about that in this evaluation .
Bmr030_729	s	The new disks are installed . ; If you need space just let me know . ; I have to create the p appropriate sub - directory . ; So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where we put a y a U doctor speech data ,
Bro018_1022	b	He he He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli ; Yeah . ; Oh well that 's That 's a pretty good point right there . ; Right .
Bed014_1301	s	and yet a word like " constraint " causes a lot of problems . ; Yeah . ; And , so . Right . So . ; OK . This is consistent with um the role I had suggested that he he play ,
Bmr025_1052	s	OK . ; Everybody ready ? ; Yeah . ; A one .
Bmr003_904	b	uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time , ; Oh ! ; so uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in in that case . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1512	s	So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it . ; cuz in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help . ; Oh yeah . ; So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough .
Buw001_2105	s	Yeah . ; I see . ; But they had multiple mikes ; and they did do recognition ,
Bns002_1326	s	Well , yeah . ; Let 's go . ; where we can have a kind of uh dual mode uh wireless network adaptor ; So if we are not able to reach any access point but we are able to reach another network node , well , maybe this network node could do me the favor to reach or to forward my packets to the access point .
Bns002_1096	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe two - B or three - B ; Yeah , but nevertheless this guy is a is an gateway in the router for for this packet , you know .
Bro004_1147	%--	Well , you you can , ; i ; right ? ; I mean y you you
Bmr020_296	bk	Yeah , ; that 's a good point . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1715	b	The reason is because w it was said " tickle " . ; What 's a QUAL ? ; Oh I see , I see . ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1215	b	Anyway . ; That 'd be a good idea . ; W uh , could you email out the brand ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_552	%--	M ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; But I guess perhaps
Bmr019_1777	ba	uh . ; Great . ; Well . ; Great .
Bmr022_646	s	Is that what you get ? ; Um , you ca you get , um ; Definitely when they don't align at all , it it it fails . ; I mean , that that 's how we found a lot of problems before , with , um , words being on the wrong place or something .
Bmr012_828	s	it was just more disk space you know for storing them ; Are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ? ; so ; Mel cepstrum .
Bed003_128	s	And and ; Like you could have a p ; By " nice " you mean ; You Like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something .
Btr001_708	b	Yeah , that happens a lot . ; Yeah right . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bed003_759	g	Yeah . ; What 's common is you just like don't observe the variable , ; Yeah . ; right ,
Bmr031_1477	s	which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person 's frustrated or not . ; That reminds me of something . ; So . ; We we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it ,
Bed006_355	b	The question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task . ; OK . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro019_770	b	and maybe that 's the argument , ; but I 'm not sure I buy it , ; so . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bed008_741	2	It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . ; Or user compatibility . ; Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh ; That don't .
Bsr001_1038	h	I mean , we clearly c should collaborate for the best of everybody . ; Hmm . ; So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ? ; Uh ,
Bro017_684	b	Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power , ; Mm - hmm . ; so because it is really it 's a p it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search ; Yeah .
Bmr026_530	qw	So they don't want to stack up external drives . ; Um And then they want everything else in the machine room . ; Right . ; So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?
Bns003_942	s	this is a living thing ; and ; it 's a pity that Multicast is , in principle , removed ; and we do not have any expert from Multicast anymore .
Bmr027_1529	s	if I could . ; Is that alright ? ; We 'll discuss it . ; OK . I guess that 's " no " .
Bmr016_1232	bk	Yeah . ; I replace the " cuz " with " because " if it 's glossed . ; S ; Right .
Bed011_1033	s	" How do I get in ? " , ; " How do I get away ? " ; Right . ; and all that kind of stuff .
Bmr018_1395	s	I 've been using Broadcast News nets for digits , ; Yeah . ; like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ? ; That 's what I did .
Btr001_2372	b	And to me that 's more of like the " Maybe this shouldn't be funny ; but it is . ; Maybe this is funny because it 's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way . " ; Mmm .
Bmr014_452	s	Mm - hmm . ; and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand ,
Bro003_1297	b	And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently , ; Mmm . ; that , you know , we 're not we won't be contributing that much . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_688	b	But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , ; which is ; TI - digits are very clean recorded digits ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_781	aa	But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things . ; Um . ; Do we h do we have , uh , um , American - born folk , uh , reading German German , uh , pla uh , place names and so forth ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1350	s	and then I 'd want to follow up on it . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . That that might get at some of what I was ; I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time ,
Bmr009_328	b	That You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone . ; Yeah . ; Plus , I think it has more elegant e ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_83	bk	but then I have to end the presentation in the middle so I can go back to open up ; OK , fine . ; Here , let 's see if I can ; Alright .
Bsr001_2527	bk	Oh , can you bring them up from the ; no , ; OK . ; Alright .
Bmr009_283	s	Right . ; But , the qu So So they 'll be ; This is I w want to point to visual things , ; But I mean they there 'll be time There 'll be overlap between the distributions ,
Bro004_868	s	MSG and and PLP . ; Yeah . ; And is this with the revised on - line normalization ? ; Ye - Uh , with the old older ,
Bro004_1325	s	Oh , that 's good . ; It just died . ; OK . ; Yeah , we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server , actually .
Bmr011_57	s	Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , I think George Doddington will be around as well . ; Uh , OK , so we can talk about that . ; Uh , I guess just hear about how things are going with , uh , uh , the transcriptions .
Bro023_202	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , um ; OK .
Bro026_504	b	And maybe for VAD they would be OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_685	s	I guess you reported on some te punctuation type ; finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , ; Yeah . ; and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt ,
Bmr019_909	ba	I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one . ; Oh , good . ; I I mean the the one with Dan Ellis in it and Eric . ; Good !
Bro005_457	s	Multi - English PLP . ; Oh no , ; it gives eighty - three point six . ; So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six ,
Bmr010_559	ba	Yeah . ; We hope . ; Yeah . Who knows ? ; That 'd be that 'd be nice .
Bro027_977	s	Yeah . ; That gives you this . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know what it does in combination .
Bsr001_435	s	But it will train them to the microphone characteristics of this c ; We wanna do both . ; And ; So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything .
Bmr003_746	b	We haven't decided which which time we care about , ; and that 's kind of one of the things that you 're saying , is like you have the option to put in more or less timing data ; and , uh , be in the absence of more specific instructions , we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is . ; Yeah ,
Bmr029_476	b	It 's just easier to do . ; Well , in the new test , actually , that 's not true . ; So Again , if this if these new segmentations work OK , then we then it 's a fair it 's a completely fair test . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2345	b	The Germans do this I think in particular . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro014_1539	s	O - OK . ; I don't know anything about re - synthesis . ; Uh , how likely do you think that is ? ; Uh , it depends what you what you do .
Bmr005_1059	s	and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that 's the party line . ; But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous .
Bmr009_1509	s	As you play , as you move , as you scroll . ; Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable . ; And this 'll be a hav having the multiwave will be a big help ; So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it .
Bed009_687	b	Oh , yeah , yeah . ; and keep these things like uh tourist information external . ; And then call it external services . ; Hmm .
Bro022_106	cc	Something something like , um , um like , uh , re regular phonetic features , ; just to just to start off that way . ; And do some phone recognition . ; Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques .
Bmr023_816	s	So , um , @ @ I ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , ; so I didn't bother to retrain the models at all , ; and it improved by one percent , ; which is about what we get with uh , with , you know , just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , the , uh uh , with the standard system .
Btr001_1472	b	and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , ; Mm - hmm . ; and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing . ; Yeah .
Bns003_597	ar	yeah . ; because ffft that 's uh , it would be a a wonder if , uh , it hook in at the same area , you know . ; Yeah , ; No , no , no .
Bro011_241	x	Mm - hmm . ; um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh I also um haven't got the code yet ,
Bmr015_993	s	OK . ; I I did i it did occur to me that this is uh , the return to the transcription , ; that there 's one third thing I wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue ; which is , um , how to handle breaths .
Bns002_1551	bk	I don't know . ; You can I you can mail him later on the informa ; I don't know who he is . ; OK .
Bro018_554	%--	um ; and made a mapping from the MFCC 's to these phonological features , ; so I 'm gonna do a similar thing with with support vector machines ; and see if
Bed005_1458	s	Yeah . ; I don't see why the , uh , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into ; I mean , they 're used to create tables ; so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML .
Bmr024_1032	d	Wh ; Right . ; You just run a program to restore them . ; The o the one that we have ?
Bro024_886	s	to ; Mmm . ; So ; If we look at the France Telecom proposal , they use some kind of noise addition .
Btr002_2439	%	Yeah . ; I was marking " lipsmack " , ; and and you said ; That 's more like the " @ @ " .
Bmr025_973	b	Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . ; although there is a little ; Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro004_788	aap	Right . ; And uh binary decisions about phonemes . ; Nnn Uh It 's ; Almost .
Bmr024_659	s	I mean , anybody who 's training something up could choose to put it eh , to u include this or not . ; Right . ; I I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . ; It isn't .
Bed008_1043	s	Yeah . ; But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? ; Mm - hmm . ; But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much .
Bro003_264	b	Yeah , but Mm - hmm . Um . ; Yeah . ; Well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we we already have uh English , Spanish and French uh , with microphone speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1022	bk	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; with like lists and lists and lists of uh various and assorted tools . ; OK .
Bro024_975	bk	Uh , ; Or ? ; so the ; OK .
Bro017_1327	aa	OK . ; Um . ; So can maybe can I t maybe start then ? ; Sure .
Bmr012_355	s	so you can see some like this Trent Lott which ; Trent Lott . ; um I mean ; these are sort of funny ones ,
Bed015_1272	s	I don't think we have it quite right yet . ; OK . ; So , uh , what this is , ; let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete .
Bmr006_568	b	One offsite , one onsite . ; Oh ! ; Oh ! ; Hunh !
Bed004_579	s	the Vista , ; or the whatever ; Uh , " approach " , you called it , I think this time . ; uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .
Bmr030_497	s	Mm - hmm . ; and I pick ones that Thilo has , um , pre - segmented , ; and I change the status to " Trans - IP IBM " , ; so that , you know , when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those .
Bed013_1160	qy	So . ; So is the question ; I mean it 's just that I 'm not sure what the ; Is the question , for this particular construction how we specify that that 's the information it provides ?
Bmr013_749	%	Yeah . ; OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then ; Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha ; No .
Btr001_2250	%--	Or I maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa ; When you end with " so " . ; When you end the utterance . ; When
Bmr002_648	co	and I 'll go down and get my stuff ? ; because um I I do think ; You don't ; Just take the thing with you .
Bed003_857	bk	So there is there 's gonna be a bunch of statues . ; And then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel . ; How about hotels ? ; OK .
Bmr007_492	s	so , you know , you you t Yeah , this is d also um , people tend to time their their their , um when they come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic , uh uh , ambient thing . ; Well ; Right . ; So you don't want to be c cross - cutting .
Bmr028_1032	aa	and ; But , say , if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace , then sitting there , then it would Its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him , and so on . ; And transfer functions . ; Right . Exactly .
Bmr012_648	ba	Sorry can't remember . ; anyway it 's ; Congratulations ; is really great .
Bmr007_739	b	Yeah . ; Beam - forming during the digit uh stuff . ; So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_460	%--	That 's that 's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time . ; But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , uh , no one could really use it . ; So , um ; I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something
Bdb001_1276	g	Right . ; So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data . ; But unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it . ; OK ?
Bmr010_483	s	I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , uh , uh , voice , uh you know , active miking , ; Uh - huh . ; basically look at the amp at the energy at each of the mikes . ; And and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mikes .
Bmr020_1505	s	Right . ; which ; i Can I maybe have have an order of ; it 's probably in your paper that I haven't looked at lately ,
Bed006_1787	s	Um are the are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago ; like the things ; maybe maybe you 're gonna run a trial tomorrow . ; I mean , I 'm just wondering whether the ac some the actual sentences from this domain will be available .
Bmr001_161	b	I mean , I think um I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or you know . ; Yeah . ; Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1461	ba	Yeah . ; OK . ; And , you know , then they 'll send us back what we w what what they send back to us , ; Oh , that 'd be great .
Bro019_866	aa	how does ; I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ? ; The signal subspace ? ; Yeah .
Bmr027_208	bk	We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . ; Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult . ; What else can we do ? ; Yeah .
Bmr024_983	b	H everytime it was a " gonna " " gonna die " . ; Well , I mean , the C Ds are are an op ; Well ; Yeah .
Bro024_1027	aa	Thirty . ; Thirty . ; Thirty - four . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_354	s	It 's just It 's just jewelry . ; OK , so um typically , what I w you know I in uh i what I 've done before is I have a uh tape recorder , with a reverse button . ; Yeah . ; And you just , you know , if it 's word level e you know , you do a e a r I just hit the r re the rewind button every couple of words
Bro027_114	s	I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse . ; On what test set ? ; On the same , uh , SpeechDat - Car , ; Aurora .
Bmr003_2295	%--	So . ; and I can certainly build it out of oak ; no problem , ; would it you know , arb you know , arbitrarily amount of
Bed002_24	2	So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . ; Other way . ; We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage . ; For our stuff .
Bed003_1726	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; you know , set up as ; I know .
Bmr018_94	bs	Sorry , not not not the days coming up , but ; The next weekend . ; It 's like the ; A week from Saturday .
Bed005_983	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You can put the microphone in your pocket . ; Hey !
Bmr027_998	s	No , no . They d they wanted the audio . ; Or the ? ; Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts . ; No , I mean of the transcripts .
Bmr026_969	b	So . ; That 's That 's certainly one thing , yeah . ; And the dictionary made a huge difference . ; Uh . Yeah .
Bmr012_951	%--	and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated ; and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on on ; They 're less animated . ; Well but he has fewer
Bsr001_1689	b	Yeah . ; just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously . ; And I was a little surprised . ; Hmm , hmm .
Bro017_627	b	Because uh your uh Gaussian mixture model , ; right ? ; computes the mean . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_835	b	and if you miss it , you know , you 've gotta go back and find it , ; Mm - hmm . ; and dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it , even . ; Right .
Bmr022_529	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; so . ; OK .
Bed012_376	%--	you know ? ; A decision node for every possible question , you mean ? ; Well , I like , in the case of Yeah . ; In the ca Any piece of language , we wouldn't be able to answer it with this system , b if we just h
Bmr005_1130	s	There 's also um ; oh yeah , ; noise . ; So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .
Bmr028_765	s	What what was on his queue for recognition experiments ? ; OK . ; Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff . ; And so what I 'm doing is , um , putting in the stream reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files .
Bmr022_825	b	Right . ; And for some of the others , it 's their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bro010_626	s	yeah . ; um ; Well , the thing , e e e e ; Yeah , y I mean , you 're talking about non - stationary noise
Bmr028_745	br	We store we store our data on Popcorn . ; Anything else ? ; That 's really great . ; Excuse me ?
Bed009_202	s	Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower . ; And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower . ; There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center ; Because that 's how the algorithm works .
Bro025_613	b	Oh , you 're talking about the VAD net . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_559	%	It 's just like four pages . ; Four pages ? ; I mean it 's it 's not even a h ; Yeah .
Bro010_1117	bk	I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . ; Yeah , ; But but , uh , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John ; right .
Bro011_331	s	what are the variables that they 're found finding useful ; Hmm . ; um ; And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features .
Bro018_739	qw	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so when you do your ; wh I 'm what is the task for the class project ?
Bmr019_1286	b	I mean , we will write it . ; Whether they accept it late or not , I don't know . ; Um , and the good thing is that we have It 's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1079	s	And , uh , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I I I think this year we we actually , uh , can do it .
Bmr023_1119	s	Yeah . I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point , ; but ; cuz he 's probably the one here ; I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem
Buw001_2065	s	but ; And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um , political debates and things like that , ; congre congressional hearings . ; Boring stuff like that .
Bdb001_254	%--	Or something like that . ; But but but most of the frames are actually not speech . ; So , ; you know , people don't
Bro012_793	%--	So . ; uh the close channel ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; and s channel one is the
Bro019_465	s	So ; So that that The baseline itself ; I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . ; I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint .
Bro027_547	s	OK , ; so it 's who un two hundred and ten . ; Uh , p Wait a minute . ; It 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech ,
Bmr019_224	s	So I just cut it out . ; You know , so I just e edited out the first , i uh , word of the utterance . ; Yeah . ; Um , so there 's a little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as TI - digits .
Bed009_970	ba	Some extensions uh have to be made . For for a English version ; Mmm . ; OK . ; Interesting .
Bro022_474	s	Everybody knows that . ; There 's all this DC offset in th " ; So , yes . ; You can have DC offset in the data .
Bed002_122	b	So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know ? ; Right .
Bro022_582	s	and I think ; I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . ; OK . ; But I think I think they they don't just have triphones .
Bmr019_983	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; but jus just a couple of places , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1381	%--	Right . ; You know . So she certainly can define it . ; Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments . ; Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties ,
Bmr031_1330	%--	But I 'm still ; Mm - hmm . ; I think early next week we 'll decide whether we 'll we 'll do one or not . ; Um . But because , you know , the results are are still confusing enough that that , um ,
Bed006_1694	aa	right ? ; So is the ri right now are the ideas the rich rich the RAD or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention . ; It 's still it 's still mainly intention hypothesis ; Yeah .
Bdb001_441	s	The only thing ; Yeah . ; Do they already have tools ? ; I mean , I I chose this for a couple reasons .
Bns001_1536	qh	So . ; And and have an intermediate project , which is related in this direction , something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever . ; This is a smaller portion in the gen more generic framework , I would like to say , from this proposal . ; Why not go in this way ?
Bmr008_450	s	One indented separately . ; So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers . ; OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes ; American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in .
Btr001_1480	%--	Chuck Wooters does the numbers . ; And , um , it cycles through . ; Wow . ; Oh , so they don't
Bro018_356	no	Because maybe they 're the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value ; Experimental results . ; Mc - McDonald 's constant . ; I don't know exactly ,
Bro017_1314	aa	Does anybody have anything else ? ; to ; Shall we read some digits ? ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1218	b	so ; Yeah , it 's more obvious that there was something there than if there 's just silence . ; Yeah , that I mean , he 's he 's removing the old thing ; Yeah .
Bmr031_633	b	We should just talk less . ; Have shorter meetings ! ; Well , if you talk less it does in fact use less me d m data . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1559	s	You know , ; two or three , ; something like that ? ; Well you get these complex pairs .
Bro021_1222	b	Uh , if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech , we have a probability f of our our weight for each Gaussian . ; No . ; And now , this weight is different now ; OK .
Btr001_1319	%--	OK . ; Yeah . ; The ones that say " IBM " are like They actually say " IBM " . ; So I don't think I 've ever
Bdb001_763	aa	Because you 're gonna have to write a program that goes through your feature file and looks for rising pitches . ; Yeah . ; So ; Right .
Bns002_1101	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; Anoth ; It must be not the whole path , you know .
Bro027_398	bk	Uh ; Oh , uh , do you know Geoff Zweig ? ; No . ; Oh .
Bmr010_1008	%--	I do have a convention . If it 's an a noncanonical p " ; That one , I think we you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant . ; OK . ; But I told them if if there 's an obvious speech error , uh , like I said in one thing ,
Bns001_197	s	his name and so on . ; so that the layout is for everybody the same , ; Yeah . ; Well , like have a blueprint .
Bed006_410	s	nuh ? ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; So to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks .
Bro027_1916	%--	but it sounds to me like , uh , looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; That and the correlation between stuff . ; So if ,
Btr001_846	s	or something like that . ; It 's probably like inaudible for us ; but ; And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause .
Bed013_309	s	No . ; I almost got into a brawl . ; But I did not finish the uh , ; But I 've been looking into it .
Bro007_380	b	it d ; I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . ; I Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1089	s	Mm - hmm . ; and uh ; Mm - hmm ; Now .
Bsr001_1097	b	Uh - huh ? ; Is that in exchange for access to the c ; Right , ; Right .
Bro024_347	s	if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds . ; Yeah . ; The way I currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds . ; So what you just said , about what do you start with , raises a question of what do I start with then ?
Bns003_1035	s	as far as I know . ; So , but this is the only guy , you know , ; but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text . ; what I mean is is , uh , the that we what 's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing , the network packages and and detailed , uh , uh , descriptions more detailed descriptions .
Bmr005_60	bk	uh about some some some um uh work about ; I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong , ; but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data . ; Oh .
Btr001_1731	g	Yeah . ; um ; You can hear , there 's like . ; You know ,
Bmr003_625	b	Oh , thank you . ; OK . ; and then say , uh , Morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have . ; Right .
Bsr001_311	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I really like this . ; Uh I I mean , if I have to design the thing , uh I I would rather , you know , use this type of thing than the other ones . ; Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all ,
Bro018_75	%--	and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that . ; No , ; I don't use that ; I can't use
Btr001_642	s	Yeah . ; I was just gonna say something . ; I was gonna say that , ; I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody 's voice if it 's the same if , uh , that person 's voice is the same
Bmr028_1559	b	And so you you assume it 's given ; It 's too hard , usually . ; because it 's , um you wanna go forward with your research , and assume that you have that information . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_454	%	Yeah . ; Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to for the transcribers ; I could do it , or Chuck or Adam . ; Thank you .
Bmr001_714	%--	Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No , well , actually we could have Jane uh Jane 's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of
Bns002_959	bk	That Because this is the way eh eh more transmissions uh ; may take take place at the same time . ; Can take place at the same time . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro019_1021	s	spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . ; And it 's ; Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . ; But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ .
Bed006_790	%--	cuz we 've been arguing about it all week , ; but uh we 'll hold the the ; Well in this case it will hold the I mean the the features I guess . ; I 'm not it 's hard for me to exactly s
Bed005_617	%--	Sort of , what I my feeling was eh we we sort of reserved something that has a r eh an OK label . ; That 's th that was my th first sort of step . ; Mm - hmm . ; I w
Bro023_754	s	Yeah , ; so far I 've seen sixty - seven ; I mean , no , ; I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent .
Bmr023_1029	%--	OK . ; All that kinda stuff . ; And so so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT ; or ?
Bmr009_620	s	Is possible to have . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's interesting , I think , to consider the the window of normalization , ; normalization window .
Bmr006_1688	b	Mm - hmm . ; But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . ; So , people are really flexible . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_496	s	c c Can I can I have an another another question w about this ? ; I thought this was gonna be fast . ; Oh well . ; So , um , there are these digits ,
Bed017_372	s	and um , I just hope that you have some comments ; or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , ; and and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you ; and and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more
Bmr019_1437	aa	I don't h I don't have any stock in HTK or Entropic or anything . ; No . I mean , this it it 's the HTK that is trained on a very limited amount of data . ; It 's d it 's very specific . ; Right .
Bmr012_1153	ar	no that 's ; do you want a handset ? ; No not the lapel . ; No .
Buw001_360	aa	not what the query is . ; What ; Right , right . ; Right .
Bmr030_352	s	So we 've sent a few to them . ; We 've gotten a few back . ; Um , ; I sorta wish Jane was were here
Bmr009_1286	s	we might learn from what they say , as to which one 's a better way to ask it . ; But I Cuz I really don't know . ; W This is just a small thing ; but um It says " Variety " and then it gives things that e have American as one of the choices .
Bed010_1093	%--	these guys are talking , ; uh we have a group on the formalization , ; uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . ; So there 're various kinds of uh
Bmr021_147	b	Right . And just make sure that you write down " Crown " or " Sony " on the mike number , ; which I 'll change to mike type , or something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_859	%--	Yeah , ; so it 's a it has the overall overall energy , ; uh ; pow
Bro028_1164	s	then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition , ; and , um , improve speech recognition in that way . ; Um , so right now I 'm in in the phase where I 'm looking at at , um , deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories . ; And I 'm looking for data data - driven methods that can help me find , um , a set of intermediate categories of speech that , uh , will help me to discriminate later down the line .
Bmr009_1128	b	Yeah . ; Let 's ; I mean it gives us good information on where they 're from , but that doesn't tell us anything ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_24	b	The , um , noise suppression , the re - synthesis of speech after suppression . ; Is the , um the CVS mechanism working well ? ; These are the ; Yeah .
Bed014_155	b	Cuz , there 's no ; Like there 's lots of unnamed functions ; Syntax . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1498	s	Yeah ! ; You see uh uh University of Mannheim , ; University ; also these are the official ones ,
Bmr010_149	s	Uh , yeah . ; That that was one one one thing , ; uh , why I added more mixtures for for the speech . ; So I saw that there were loud loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers .
Bmr016_1955	%--	You can't have the seven and ; So what 's to the left of these ? ; The left is i ; so example the very first one ,
Bmr030_693	%--	I think it was ; Oh yeah , I don't know . ; The demo ? ; Something about
Bed015_2222	ba	But we can do four . ; OK , it 's fine . ; I can do one . ; It 's fine .
Bro021_327	b	Um ; Yeah . It was it was , uh , the same system . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr007_1283	ba	Agenda ? ; yeah ; that that would be that 'd be good . ; Good .
Bmr020_739	s	because it 's sort of meant for recognition . ; So anyone who hears this meeting now knows the ; Beta ? ; And then then in there I have a file that lists all the other files ,
Bed002_1240	s	and I started unta pack the Linux one , ; it told me that I can't really unpack it ; because it contains a future date . ; So this is the time difference between Germany .
Bns003_1055	cc	uh , that device is switched on , ; so please do not switch off the devices . ; And I will call Herr Janin and that Adam @ @ . ; So I will start .
Bro011_685	qw	Yeah . ; But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things ; Yeah . ; how much better can you make it ?
Bmr020_81	s	Uh , ; so the only agenda items were Jane was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM transcription process . ; There 's an agenda ? ; I sort of condensed the three things you said into that .
Bmr013_871	s	Mm - hmm . ; or Pi - uh Tcl TCL I mean . ; It 's like ; y it 's and so , um , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that
Bro022_909	%--	So . ; But ; Yeah . ; But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done
Bro026_178	b	Um . ; Well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . ; So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1143	s	So , that 's ; Yeah . Then it would work . ; But but , I mean , i it 's With finite of those things ; I mean , uh , we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in
Bmr031_1036	b	Which one it is ? ; Yeah . ; But I don't think it 's " aha ! " . ; Yeah .
Bed009_797	b	yeah , also ; and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context . ; Right . ; Yeah
Bed017_160	s	And so some of these classes are ; s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , ; or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . ; S like , um , these here ,
Bro004_524	s	Yeah . ; Then And ; OK ; so I think what I 'm what I saw in your smaller chart that I was thinking of was was there were some numbers I saw , I think , that included these multiple languages
Bmr002_542	%--	Right . ; Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns ; and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , " this is where this speaker change came in " ; and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about
Bmr031_1280	b	Mm - hmm . ; Based on Hub - five , or like like your ? ; u Based on their Hub - five recognizer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_518	bk	Sure , ; of course . ; That would be a meeting meeting meeting ? ; A meeting meeting meeting .
Bro004_582	b	In in what ? ; the uh the um networks are trained with noise from Aurora TI - digits , ; Aurora - two . ; mmm .
Bmr008_560	%--	Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down . ; so it might be better to just do it for the ; yeah you could leave region for for the others but have circled choice for the American English . ; One one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you you know , about the data later on you can say " well I chose these based on TIMIT " , And
Bro024_644	s	So . ; Uh , ; yeah . ; So all the hi H M numbers are w very good ,
Bns001_999	s	It 's l just a thirty - bit number ; Mm - hmm . ; that a actually is an assigned number . ; But it 's all only used for identification .
Bro012_1412	%--	Yeah . ; but I don't know . ; If this voicing bit doesn't help , uh , I think we don't have to to work more about this ; because
Bro026_606	b	After that . ; Oh ! ; Interesting . ; OK .
Bmr013_25	bk	Anything else more pressing than those things ? ; So So , why don't we just do those . ; You said yours was brief , so ; OK .
Bmr008_802	b	OK . ; they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these , ; I 'm Canadian , or ; Yeah .
Bed005_709	b	Not only anaphora , ; but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions , ; and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1071	%--	Is different . Is different . ; but but maybe that maybe we could leave this ; and see what people See what people choose ; and then um let them just fill in if they don't
Bed011_360	qw	I think your suggestion is good , which is we 'll do a b uh a batch . ; OK . ; And , uh , ; Fey , How long is it gonna be till you have ten subjects ?
Bed005_1473	s	which isn't so bad . ; I I understand . ; I 'm just saying tha that w ; That was wi that was my note .
Bed005_1102	no	So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of " ninety - two " paper . ; Mm - hmm . ; D and you got one , Robert . ; I don't know who else has seen it .
Bed012_868	s	OK . ; As long as that 's O K . ; Um . ; I mean , I might slip out and say it accidentally .
Bed013_1415	b	OK , this is the other bit of news . ; The subjects today know Fey , ; so she can't be here , and do the wizarding . ; Huh .
Bmr016_1442	s	but they all were like " uh " . ; You mean just the single letter " a " as in the particle ? ; The transcription or ; No , no , I mean like the the " UH " ,
Bdb001_414	bk	And why did you not choose that type of approach ? ; Uh , because I knew that we were doing speech , ; and I thought it was better if you 're looking at a raw file to be t for the tags to say " it 's an utterance " , as opposed to the tag to say " it 's a link " . ; OK .
Bmr024_788	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , great . ; Yeah . ; They they even have a reading list .
Bsr001_541	bk	Oh , this would drive me crazy . ; Mmm . ; And , yeah , ; Oh .
Bmr016_1496	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , it 's good , ; This is really really helpful . ; yeah .
Bmr022_194	t3	It 's just in this case they were not . ; seven or something ? ; Or ; What is it ?
Bed016_1027	%--	I mean , there 's also things like I mean , s ; um , ; I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " ; in a sort of
Bro003_1012	%	Or you just add it to the features . ; No . ; Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension . ; Here .
Bro024_1289	s	I don't know if we want to talk about that . ; But , ; well , the the " Car " noises are below like five hundred hertz . ; And we were looking at the " Music " utterances
Bns002_7	s	OK . ; So , welcome to our next meeting . ; Uh , today we will have a talk from Miguel Sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad - hoc networks . ; We have here a guest , a former ICSI member of the NSA group , Jordi Domingo Pasqual .
Bro003_445	s	Um , yeah , so I I 've been looking at , uh , uh , TIMIT stuff . ; Um , the the stuff that we 've been working on with TIMIT , trying to get a , um a labels file so we can , uh , train up a train up a net on TIMIT and test , um , the difference between this net trained on TIMIT and a net trained on digits alone . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and seeing if if it hurts or helps .
Bed008_1107	ar	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And four you we can handle . ; No .
Bed003_458	bk	So then you just have some probabilities over ; Everything is probablistic , ; and There 's always ; OK .
Bro007_113	%--	there is something funny happening here because ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and
Bmr008_1371	s	uh , I I don't know . ; So , uh , from from these charts , are ; Yeah . ; hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were ,
Bro016_265	%--	And if you have a nice front - end that 's in roughly the right range ; I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level , ; and we would rarely adjust them again , ; even though you could get a
Bed013_630	ft	Excellent . ; OK . ; That 's a very cool T - shirt . ; Thank you .
Bed006_1248	b	um ; Well , every action has a set of related schemas ; like Source - Path - Goal or force , whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_717	b	as you said , to I mean , we would like the idea to have it there ; So w ; but but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms , to push the state of the art on this transcription task . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_808	%--	Some errors , yeah . ; I don't know . ; I do I don't know the answer to that . ; I 'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for
Bro005_1285	s	I mean I I I used to work with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh with a neural net system ; and uh , it was a common problem that you 'd ; Oh , and this Actually , this is true not just for neural nets ; but just for in general if people were working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come came from uh , a mainstream recognizer .
Bro024_164	s	And then there 's um , another thing I wanna start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length . ; So I 've just been using two seconds ; just because that 's what Carlos did before . ; Uh , I wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds .
Bmr016_866	ba	Then put it all on scratch ; because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm , very good point .
Bmr015_54	h	Uh , right , so so I I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Oh , great . ; Uh ,
Bro027_706	b	That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel , ; right ? ; So I think , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_486	s	So we 're deriving um this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? ; Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? ; Well you could , ; that 's a that 's a choice .
Bmr003_1633	aa	Then , so question mark colon is fine for that . ; That 's a fine idea . ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bmr026_104	cc	Yeah , I haven't done that . ; So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory . ; Yeah . ; I 'll try to get to that .
Bed015_1668	b	OK , so it 's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context . ; And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever , um , you you you 're scope is m might extend out to the the base one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1034	s	Yeah . ; Uh , I don't know if you have these improvement the detailed improvements for Italian , Finnish , and Spanish there ; Fff . ; or you have just have your own .
Bed005_1112	bk	So , I u w Um , yo uh you Have you read it yet ? ; Uh , you can Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess . ; OK , so you should take a look . ; OK
Bmr018_1081	s	Cool . ; I thought it was higher than that , that 's pr ; It really it depends a lot . ; This is just sort of an overall
Bmr031_1128	bk	But it works . ; What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ? ; Tcl - TK . ; I see .
Bmr008_1071	b	social security number , ; Yeah , that 's right . ; And a bank where you frequent . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_165	b	Ah . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; DTD . ; yeah .
Buw001_711	aa	So , uh ; But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , ; and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . ; Right .
Bmr009_798	bk	Oh no no . ; Is is new Is OK . ; So don't fill these out . ; Alright .
Buw001_1440	s	and that way you 'll get more variety . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's good . ; I wouldn't even say that " that they learned " .
Bro019_460	bk	because you don't have the mistakes in it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; OK .
Bed003_1346	%--	I think I see . ; So the discourse refers to " admission fee " but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . ; Yeah . ; you have to have some notion of not just
Bed006_942	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_934	s	coming up with some things and just trying them out ; and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise , ; where you 're really just i i ; the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,
Bmr008_872	s	um And then you can ask these other questions as well , ; but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place ; and that therefore they 're ; I mean , nowadays hardly anybody from California has a native Californian accent ,
Bro012_1009	b	if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_819	s	But ; Yeah . ; Then I tried the same exactly the same spectral subtraction algorithm on these Aurora tasks ; and it simply doesn't work .
Bns003_891	g	I know , in the past it was always if I 'm not writing something nothing gonna happen . ; So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity . ; You have to use your time to finish your work as you uh , have in mind until your end of February , ; or is that right ?
Bmr018_134	s	So , i I I will be I mean , he 's taking a very early flight ; Oh . ; and we do have the time work difference running the right way , ; but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven .
Bed009_465	s	yeah and um it might actually ; and that 's ; OK ; ah also because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already
Bdb001_1188	s	Because we had one set of annotations that were based on , uh , one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation , ; and then we had another version that was based on , uh , a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation . ; So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . ; So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations .
Bmr022_199	s	So I think uh , Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked , ; M - one - hundred . ; which is these they 're listening to it and so they write something down , and let 's say they miss it , they rewind . ; Well , they hear the beep again .
Bed005_360	s	Um . ; Where is the uh ; What are you looking for ? ; Um , where it actually produces the the XML out of the , uh , parsed stuff .
Bmr005_464	bk	to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . ; Oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bmr025_243	%--	Wow . ; I hope he never listens to these meetings . ; That 's right . ; So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh uh , SoftSound guy , uh
Bro018_868	s	but maybe not , since they ; Yeah see one thing that 's a little bit um ; I was looking I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created . ; And um his uh the way that the S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly ,
Bed005_653	s	and , um , ; Then then , ; yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ? ; Uh , this and this , of course , was just the action end .
Bed006_350	aa	so . ; OK . ; Talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_205	%--	so it 's really not a big part . ; Yeah , I see . ; I mean , the talk 's only twenty minutes . ; It 's just gonna be a couple of
Bed006_974	%	Uh - huh . ; Right . ; however it is uh you know sort of these sort of things are imaginable . ; Tsk .
Bmr023_976	s	and and an ; Y ; Right . ; And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system .
Bmr011_154	b	Is fixed . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_618	qy	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So is that ? Uh , are are these results comparable ?
Bns001_1549	s	because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent , you are decoupled from networking stuff . ; Because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it 's a network or other thing , ; Well , I 'm foc ; it doesn't matter
Bmr020_635	bk	Yeah . ; and do the do whatever you r wanna do , ; Uh - huh . ; Oh yeah .
Btr002_90	b	Hmm . ; Right . ; And then there are various ones like , um , um , " ish decay " instead of " HTK " . ; Oh .
Bro003_834	ar	No . ; No . ; Sp - Not Spanish stories ? ; No .
Bmr001_327	s	So I guess this a pretty dense group ; but it it 's getting a lot higher . ; Yeah , but But that it 's ; We 're not , even , you know It 's we 're just It 's not like we We we may be technical , but we 're not particularly PDA people .
Btr001_505	%--	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's right . ; and
Bed008_750	%--	right ; Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . ; Uh maybe not . ; I mean the that 's the the issue is um
Bmr006_619	qy	So . ; So , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , ; but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , ; but are we g do we have some other other space now ?
Buw001_1043	s	So , if they 're already here I think that 's good , ; but if they 're not already here for I 'd rather do email . ; Right . ; Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is ,
Bro016_920	b	I think that would involve to to mmm use a big a al already a big bunch of the system of Ericsson . ; Because he has spectral subtraction , ; then it 's followed by , um , other kind of processing that 's are dependent on the uh , if it 's speech or noi or silence . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1356	b	Yeah . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . ; Ah ! ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_61	s	Hi . ; Hi Jane ! ; Yeah . ; We just started .
Bro003_1189	%--	something like that . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . Right , ; And it
Bmr026_470	s	Yep . ; Skip the rest of the conversation . ; Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings . ; And it 's about a gig uncompressed .
Bmr003_407	%--	I 'm glad to see that it got released . ; What 's it sound like ? ; So it it 's a very nice thing . ; Yeah , I I wish
Bmr029_703	s	But st while I 'm doing the processing , I 'll nee I need twice as much disk space . ; OK . I 'm gonna I 'll check with , um , Markham , ; and see what happened with the the disks . ; He went to put those on a couple of weeks ago
Bmr002_1277	bk	And so , if if Liz or someone else wants to do some work on uh prosody and on stress and so on then we can go back to the data and generate the uh the transcripts that we need . ; I 'm d ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Buw001_388	qw	So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . ; So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? "
Btr002_2548	b	" Hmm ! ; a sort of like a sup uh , an uh , an elevated " hmm " ? ; I hadn't thought of that . " ; Right .
Bro003_166	s	well , it is , uh , a digit French database of microphone speech , ; downsampled to eight kilohertz ; and I 've added noise to one part , with the actually the Aurora - two noises . ; And , @ @ so this is a training part .
Bro018_229	bk	Right . ; This is for the other one . ; I should I can't show that . ; OK .
Bmr014_365	%--	Yeah . ; So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , ; or something of ; There 's got to be more than thirty hour
Bro024_1837	s	With the noise I have worse result , that if I doesn't use it . ; Uh - huh . ; But m that may be because with this technique we are using really really clean speech . ; The speech the representation that go to the HTK is really clean speech
Bro021_131	%--	and then somebody said " yeah , it does seem like , you know , C - zero is the one that 's , you know , the major one " or , uh , s ; I can't remember exactly what it was now . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . There
Bro023_17	b	Huh . ; So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing ; Cool . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1039	co	so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were standard features . ; Yeah . ; I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to ? ; Uh . Talk with Stephane .
Bmr024_1366	b	Oh . ; because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train . ; So ; Hmm .
Bro018_0	bk	 ;  ;  ; OK .
Bro019_787	%--	Um , ; Does it matter , ; or ? ; I d
Btr001_819	b	That 's fascinating . ; Yeah . ; I like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_930	s	Uh ; Been looking at synthesizers ? ; Synthesizers ? ; You were looking at Festival .
Bed012_722	s	because I myself am going to be , um , gone , ; but this is actually not really important . ; Just this weekend we 're going camping . ; Yeah , I 'm wanna be this gone this weekend , too .
Btr002_1162	s	Amaretto ? ; So we got more more multi - keyboardal people ? ; Ready . ; I just have no preference .
Bro017_1151	s	And so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed . ; Uh - huh . ; The range of values . ; Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data .
Bro012_1373	b	Uh - huh . ; and see if giving the d uh , this voicing bit would help in in terms of uh frame classification . ; Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ? ; Mmm .
Bmr019_383	%	I 'll get it . ; But you could if you want . ; Yeah . At any rate , I don't know if w ; I don't know .
Buw001_270	ba	because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . ; How about this idea ? ; That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . ; Yeah , good .
Bed003_582	no	Actually forget the verb . ; OK . ; just uh ; I don't know ,
Bmr016_808	s	Don , you had disk space and storage formats . ; Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting , ; or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ? ; Um , I had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms
Bns001_1648	s	And the service people are considering ; " OK , UMTS ; you have some location information , ; and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car ,
Bmr024_149	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , and I I dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback ; Yep . ; bu uh , I don't think it 's probably in the original file .
Bed003_124	s	feature . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; I either could put " nice walls " on its own line or " open to suggestions " off the slide .
Bmr014_218	no	They got sa apparent ; Well , Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? ; I have no clue . ; Uh , I don't know .
Bmr009_1467	qw	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; with a with an S ; " which one
Bmr011_306	s	He he has a prototype . ; I I , uh , @ @ didn't didn't see it , uh , yesterday ; but I 'm going to see it today . ; And , uh , that 's that will enable us to do nice um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments .
Bed016_833	s	Huh ? ; There was one on on " out " or " out of " ? ; There was a ; Well , it may be just " out " .
Bed006_1440	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back , ; each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh , you know , entity can have which parents , ; and then
Bmr012_901	qy	Mmm . ; Thank God it 's not more than that . ; So ; Is eight kilohertz is is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?
Bro026_357	b	That 's very close . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_291	b	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Eh and probably . I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1229	%--	so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together ; it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . ; When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ? ; Well , see they ,
Bmr019_1529	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um , let 's see . ; I think the only thing we had left was unless somebody else
Bed011_169	s	whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . ; How much will he is he willing to spend ? ; Or can spend . ; Being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there
Bro028_315	b	What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ? ; Alright ? ; So now you put the pitch in . ; Uh - huh .
Bro011_106	s	Uh - huh . ; Um . ; Try try what ? ; So try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .
Bed003_1073	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So theoretically you could edit that .
Bmr023_592	aa	No , I 'm serious . ; " You 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . " ; Really ? ; Yeah .
Bmr010_365	s	Super . ; OK . Great . ; Yeah . I mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it , ; you know , who just doesn't happen to be here anymore .
Bro012_1315	b	if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors ; Mm - hmm . ; and roughly independent errors , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1296	s	Right . ; I 'm just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard features , ; What 's Are the freq ? ; you know , if that 's also different or in the same direction or not .
Bmr025_80	s	Yes , ; OK , good . ; exactly . ; We 're sort of doing things in parallel ,
Bro010_291	b	I don't think you can really tell . ; A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , ; and ; Yeah .
Bns001_794	s	There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies , ; like the zip uh s zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit . ; That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management . ; Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets .
Bmr010_1332	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; uh , but , uh , ; its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would
Bro012_1026	s	Maybe that 's what you were thinking . ; I don't know . ; I don't know . I mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be . ; That that seems like one prominent thing .
Bed005_451	aa	It d it n That 's because ; So , it 's not just that it 's adding that field . ; It 's ; Right .
Bmr007_63	s	Cuz that 's Cuz that was all all about the , uh ; Oh , OK . ; I I I can chat with you about that off - line . ; That 's another thing .
Bmr023_738	s	for for , you know , five word ; Hmm . ; there are much fewer than in Switchboard . ; So the missing We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard
Bed015_1458	b	Mats Gould . ; And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart . ; So he 's not there anymore . ; Hmm .
Bro025_507	b	This is with just fifteen frames . ; Um . ; We take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it , ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1480	bk	I think we 've we 've covered that one up extremely well . ; Mm - hmm . ; Whew ! ; OK .
Bro008_430	s	MSG Yeah . ; Well , but it was an MSG - like thing , but it wasn't MSG , ; right ? ; Uh , you y I think in some case you got some little improvement ,
Bmr024_385	s	Yeah . ; I mean it ; sure , there there might be a place where it 's " beep seven beep eight beep eight beep " . ; But , you know , they they 're they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks .
Bed008_1102	s	so this ; This is this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next , ; which is s if that 's true uh how do we wanna combine those ? ; O or when it 's true ?
Bed008_528	bs	Oh , OK . ; Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing ; which is uh the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models , ; so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions ,
Bmr031_330	ba	and and all that all that stuff , ; and ; But . ; But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance .
Bmr005_929	s	I 'm not sure . ; we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that , ; Yeah . ; and that seems to be a lot of overlap .
Bmr027_420	s	I mean , and either way works ; probably , I mean . ; Except I really think in this case ; I I 'm agr I agree with Liz , that we need to be in the clear
Bmr006_1291	s	OK . OK . ; So so if there 's two ; And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . ; It 's spread out .
Bmr007_149	%--	No , no , no . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; but
Bro025_496	qy	what 's , uh ? ; That 's that 's a good set of work that that , uh ; Just one more thing . ; Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation ,
Bmr010_668	s	Yeah . We we can try and look at that together . ; And then , uh ; just in terms of how you wear them ; I mean , I had thought about this before .
Bro021_216	s	as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy , it whitens everything ; Huh . Oh , OK . ; and ; and the high - energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise .
Bro013_150	b	But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones . ; Right . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_746	b	in U doctor speech data SRI Hub - five , there 's this , uh , Hub - five training set . ; Mmm . Mm - hmm . ; Now , is that the long training set there ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_251	s	But anyway , uh . ; I don't really know . ; Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever . ; Ooo , it 's just big .
Bed006_844	s	Those are ; It 's gonna be one y you 'll pick one of those for ; Right . ; OK these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role .
Bro007_249	b	but sometime the sentence have only one digit ; Seven digits . ; and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards , something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_374	s	I didn't ask why . ; But it seems to me that really doesn't matter . ; If they have the disk space to do it , it seems that that is not a big deal . ; I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion about mismatched rates .
Bmr010_303	bk	That 's not Praat . ; It 's called " trans transedit " I think . ; It 's a different one . ; I see .
Btr002_1654	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; M yeah , the ones that where they 're talking about linguistic things , though , are great . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_884	s	what was the other thing ? ; Well , that was combined with the triangular . ; Right ? ; Yeah . Those those two were together .
Bro012_1488	s	Mm - hmm . ; and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit , ; which ; That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits ,
Bmr007_364	s	depends what you 're doing , ; if Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting . ; Mm - hmm ? ; So the question is , you know " are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person party " .
Btr002_65	ba	Yeah . ; Wow ! ; I I ; It 's really enormously far away .
Bed011_633	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean like for example my my father is about to travel to Prague . ; Yep . ; He 'll be there for two weeks .
Bmr031_753	%--	Well , they have the two gig already . ; yeah . ; And I 'm I 'm just thinking forty of them is probably still smaller in area than , uh , one normal - sized drive . ; Actually , what I think what what , uh
Bmr006_367	aa	Yeah . ; Special ? ; Yep . ; I I I I I agree .
Bsr001_1640	ar	Or , I mean is the intention to do some som ; I think ; Well , we 'll definitely need to do both . ; No ,
Btr002_2874	%--	but they were there . ; I think they 're there pretty much a all the time . ; I agree . ; I did I did do one analysis wh where I looked at one meeting ,
Bed012_656	aa	Yeah , there 's a dog one , too , ; but that 's in Java Bayes , ; isn't it ? ; Right .
Bmr016_928	aa	Yeah . ; Oh yeah th ; Yeah those are gonna be kept . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr002_782	s	Oh , yeah . ; Different coding schemes . ; But it doesn't have enough pictures . ; So , I think it will require too much reading to understand whether this is anything that we can easily use .
Bmr022_1301	%	And then when you check it in , it puts , sort of , you know every change that you 've done is goes into the central ; Right . ; So if that 's at an ; Hmm .
Bmr028_1401	bk	So . ; It 's saying so it 's all above the table . ; I 'm actually using this other thing . ; OK .
Bmr028_496	qy	so they 're they 're harder to find . ; Well , not the ones that ; Are you su ? Are you sure ? ; Am I sure about what ?
Bro013_73	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . Because ; But ; But I guess the main point is the data because
Bed010_881	s	Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic . ; OK . ; Uh . Huh ? ; Good to know .
Bro004_792	b	But I mean it it it does give a distribution . ; Yeah . ; It 's and and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar , that uh the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other , too . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1081	s	And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village ; and ; Yeah . ; and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above ,
Bro005_76	b	And f also for Italian , actually . ; If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , ; so , the mismatched condition , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1166	s	Nuh . ; Just a back door that I I think we should devote m ; Could happen . ; Yeah . So in terms of of the , um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh .
Bro010_713	aa	We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance ; and ; Oh , yeah , ; sure .
Bns003_125	s	Yes , ; we have , eh , for for secure socket , ; and , uh for web access , the fire wall is open . ; That 's all .
Btr001_1681	aa	and ; Yeah , that 's right . ; And even bigger things . ; yeah ,
Bro021_681	s	And , ugh ! ; I I mean , i uh , it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse . ; I was looking at the spectrograms that I got ; and it 's , like w it 's it 's very horrible .
Bmr005_146	s	because i in narratives , you know I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious , ; Mm - hmm . ; so . ; Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel
Bro023_1299	aa	So , instead o of using the current estimated mean to , uh , subtract the current frame , it 's better to use an estimate that 's some somewhere in the future . ; Um ; And that 's what causes the latency ? ; Yeah .
Bed011_1055	%--	And I I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer , ; Yeah . ; but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like , ; so
Bsr001_345	t3	Yeah . ; Well well try this one on . ; Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional . ; I didn't know that you could whistle that
Bro003_1256	s	So you could be ; we have quite a few SPERT boards . ; You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT different SPERT boards ; and and have ten other jobs running on different computers .
Bed013_518	ba	it 's ; I usually enjoy writing papers . ; It 's not I don't re regard it as a painful thing . ; Mm - hmm . It 's fun .
Bmr012_1229	%	OK . ; One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . ; So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine ; uh Yep ,
Bro023_203	%--	Yeah . ; And , um ; OK . ; Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .
Bsr001_1594	b	OK , OK , OK . ; Mmm . ; but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_891	%	I gotcha . ; So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . ; I see . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1215	b	I mean , you have to figure out what your targets are . ; Yeah , ; I was thinking if you had a clean version of the signal and and a noisy version , and your targets were the M F - uh , you know , whatever , frequency bins ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_276	s	So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy .
Bmr009_1525	bk	No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed . ; Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches . ; No . No . ; Oh OK .
Bmr026_97	s	Can you mail that out to the list ? ; Mm - hmm , yeah I will . ; I ; That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages
Bed002_1296	b	because car navigation systems don't really care . ; You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , ; some now do the house number . ; Hmm .
Bns001_1378	s	That 's just the same question just other way around . ; Let let me put an example . ; You know I Some days ago , I bought , like some of you , this kind of things . ; This is a PDA
Bmr006_922	aa	Bad . ; Right . ; But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr028_1585	ba	But but , uh , I I 'd never heard that before . ; Yep . ; OK . That 's interesting . OK . ; So , so i so , that 's interesting .
Bro008_361	aa	go ahead . ; but the driving conditions , I mean the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing , ; is that right ? ; Yeah .
Bdb001_717	aa	and it has these words in it " . ; So you would be able to go in and say , you know , " give me all the words in the bound in the prosodic phrase ; and give me all the words in the " ; Yep .
Bed011_183	s	everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - U , ; and whatever we specify for the so - called " Keith node " , or the discourse , what comes from the um parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the D and the ontology to the sub - O node . ; And um one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place . ; But this makes the design thing fairly simple .
Bmr019_202	b	Mmm . ; So , one so there were a number of things we noted from this . ; One is , yeah , the SRI system is a lot better than the HTK ; Hmm .
Bns001_1502	s	to what is available ; and and currently as I see what uh will be available within the NSA group . ; OK . ; And uh , the point is if we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff and em some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff , whatever this means , It might be we have then the active classroom ,
Bmr026_520	qw	So I was assuming he was gonna take over that . ; But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . ; Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . ; And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do .
Bdb001_609	aa	Um , you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID . ; Mm - hmm . ; So each thing refers to the utterance that it belongs to . ; Right .
Bmr014_792	s	this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . ; You know ? ; Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . ; It depends on what meetings .
Bmr021_656	b	And this is not ; Oh , I 'm sorry , ; I I just ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_142	b	Yeah . ; My mind was some ; So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities ; Yeah .
Buw001_1418	%	Importance ? ; generati generating an interesting summary , um ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro012_874	bk	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; or the variation in it was larger , uh than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias . ; So the it 's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component . ; OK .
Bmr026_222	s	and you can't you can't access that ; so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack ; and then install the Transcriber thing ; and then do the patches .
Bmr003_780	s	uh , not in this case . ; It could do that ; couldn't it . ; We could program that pretty easily ,
Bdb001_909	s	Um , one that Chuck mentioned is starting out with something that we don't have to start over , that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions , ; Right . ; and being able to at least get enough , uh , information out on where we condition the location of features on information that 's in the kind of file that you put up there . ; And that would that would do it ,
Bed011_31	s	And here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection . ; So all of these tasks ; The reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . ; And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um intention .
Bed006_838	s	We can talk about Paths being the fastest , the quickest , the nicest and so forth , ; uh or or and the Trajector should be coming in there as well . ; OK . ; And then G the same about Goals .
Bmr018_1592	b	but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different , ; I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in in Broadcast News , ; Well it 's different for different tasks . ; Yeah .
Bed010_609	ba	I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames . ; Alright ! ; So . ; Cool !
Bmr020_1318	aap	You know ; Is the problem the lapel , ; or or ; Uh , it really depends .
Bmr019_143	2	Much the same thing , ; and and it was ; uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , the , uh the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know , all the participants in Aurora , was so much worse than the than the S R ; Everybody .
Bro023_328	s	So it improves ; but it it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline . ; So ; But that 's what I 'm confused about ,
Bmr006_1412	s	Yeah . ; It was yeah , it was interesting . ; But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . ; And you can't just always go , " well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up " .
Bro027_1860	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And then maybe it would just learn learn it better . ; Um ; But that 's
Bmr009_1450	ba	That 's right . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And it 's easy on the subjects .
Bns002_64	bk	Everything is done . ; Then , uh , we have to read these number ; and we go around here , every member . ; OK .
Bed010_811	s	He he already well ; i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces . ; Yeah . ; Well there 's there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw .
Bro004_1035	s	Uh . To get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . ; Um And , he didn't think they had , ; um . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net ; and maybe sometimes you don't run the other ,
Bmr030_323	s	So what I mean is , like the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here ? ; Or you grabbed code from somewhere else ? ; That ; No , we grabbed most of it .
Bmr016_1913	b	maybe , yeah . ; Well , that 'd qualify . ; On the glosses for numbers , ; Yeah .
Bmr021_548	%--	Well , both need to be reorganized . ; OK . ; So um , ; various paths , th
Bed010_1046	bk	So , uh , unless we wanna start digging into the uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably ; I I tho ; It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure . ; OK .
Bsr001_981	s	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; It depends very much on the mix . ; Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters . ; Yeah , it 's just , I I know that there are periods where two people are talking in t at the same time
Bmr003_1796	b	OK . ; I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . ; So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit ; OK .
Bmr010_76	bk	Well , uh , I guess the work that 's been done on segmentation would be most ; I think that would be a good thing to start with . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed002_864	s	Mm - hmm . ; You know , and it 's sort of there . ; And you see the label of the name ; So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth ,
Bmr025_155	b	And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it ; well uh to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . ; So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1372	s	I want to have really the activities ; you know , what is really the outcome ; what is really the problem we are going to solve . ; These are my questions .
Bro019_1438	b	Yeah . ; or , no ? ; Uh , well , s s som something like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_517	%--	Yeah . ; But then the ; Have you started looking at the pitch related stuff at all , ; or ?
Bmr022_1328	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; If I found an error , and I sent them email and said " here 's this error " , and I didn't get a response for a couple weeks , I would stop sending them the my data ; and I would start collecting it here
Bro005_1289	b	Uh , You get something from the the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . ; But they 're working really hard , too . ; So by the time you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score ; Mmm .
Bro014_218	aa	uh ; Oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora participant sort of thing . ; For ; Yeah .
Btr001_480	s	Mm - hmm . ; but I c I kn I think I know what she 's doing . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I mean , I think I know the mistake she 's making .
Bmr003_2593	%--	A PC and a peanuts . ; PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff . ; Yeah . ; And that 's about cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the
Buw001_1620	t1	Um , ; Right . ; let 's see . ; Choo - choo - choo .
Bmr015_1065	b	So . ; because i it basically has a i it shows very clearly the contrast between , uh , speech recognition research and discourse research ; because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1053	2	Uh , these are things which , uh , John felt that a a , uh a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . ; Oh , OK . ; So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . ; Placing stuff ,
Buw001_1318	b	rather than the ; And it might be something minor of minor importance to the meeting . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2968	s	I mean , you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and , you know , they 're th it 's like the the apparatus is sort of almost kicking in ,
Bmr006_576	bk	No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable ; OK . ; Oh , good . ; I see .
Bed004_225	b	Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student , ; she just graduated ; but anyway . ; Hmm .
Bed014_692	qy	Now , uh But I think Ro - Robert 's right , that to determine that , OK ? you may well want to go through a th thesaurus ; " discourse enter " . ; and and ; So , if the issue is , if so now th this construction has been matched and you say " OK . Does this actually have any implications for our decisions ? " Then there 's another piece of code that presumably does that computation .
Bro027_581	%--	OK . ; which is fifty milliseconds . ; Yeah . ; No , I mean , the
Bro016_613	s	It just something that popped into my head just now . ; And so I I ; I mean , you could maybe use the ideas a similar idea to what they do in vocal tract length normalization . ; You know , you have some sort of a , uh , general speech model ,
Buw001_1365	qh	Yeah . ; W we just need to start somewhere . ; Yeah , and this is a starting point . ; The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now
Btr001_135	s	Yeah . ; No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , that they 're not in circulation right now , ; that they 're they were unpopular . ; I liked them ,
Bmr003_2416	s	With a with a with a w ; No , ; and he he had , reque @ @ ; my my proposal is you have a laptop .
Bro027_1092	b	What what was it trained on again ? ; The one that you used ? ; It 's TIMIT with noise . ; Uh - huh .
Bro005_369	s	It is some piece of part of it . ; Or , one million frames . ; And the multi - English is how much ? ; You have here the information .
Bmr007_1254	ba	and then the DARPA meeting I just excised completely , ; Yeah . ; so it 's in a private directory . ; That 's great .
Bmr016_722	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah , Dave Dave uh is , um , also gonna be doin usin playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff ,
Btr001_2004	aa	and no idea what you 're talking about . " ; And there was a whole set of meetings that are like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's right .
Bmr012_357	s	um I mean ; these are sort of funny ones , ; It 'll get those though . ; there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references ,
Bro021_49	s	Oh , OK . ; And it 's , ; yeah , ; September .
Bmr014_85	s	and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come ; and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , ; in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up ; and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing
Bns002_770	%--	OK ? ; So this only is taking eight milliseconds , ; which is not a lot of time if you are travelling , let 's say , at uh one hundred kilometers per second . ; No , s
Bro018_155	b	Ah I 'm sorry . ; This is f ; You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1725	s	if you say " these data are available , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; but these are imperfect ,
Bro005_432	s	Mm - hmm . ; And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet . ; Not t not ; It 's eight eighty - eight point six .
Bro019_93	s	and um , ; I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , ; but , uh , in addition , we 're running ; So the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running P - make and Customs here
Bmr012_276	bk	Um But that shouldn't affect anything ; so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice , ; S ; OK
Bro013_64	g	Mm - hmm . ; But but uh what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take ; I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , ; right ?
Bro023_688	b	I mean , in the long run you 're doing the same thing ; but y but there you make different approximations , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_954	s	Right ? ; So th so what I would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the ; Yeah . ; not just for fun ,
Bns001_825	s	So " network applications " , if you look at the name of the group , one thing is that um the they used to call a a n a " network " that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network . ; If you look at " network " from the OZ layer , then it 's uh , level two or something or maybe level three , but everything below three . ; So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh " network " . ; No , I believe " network " is , if you see it really from from the IP protocol suite , is then layer one , in principle , up t including layer four ,
Bmr018_895	s	Tools . ; but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution , ; Oh it 's it 's a ; so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .
Bmr006_1660	b	Yeah . Yeah , I think ; Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_37	bk	So for the um read numbers task , I have extracted these ; Mm - hmm . ; Hang on , let 's let 's OK let 's just let 's just name the microphones . ; OK .
Bro013_463	s	Uh - huh . ; Clean , and this noise . ; Uh . ; These are the two
Bro022_763	s	I i Just to clarify something for me . ; I ; Mm - hmm . ; They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .
Bmr025_632	s	OK . ; They take up a lot more room anyway . ; Yeah . ; Uh but we do need more disk .
Bro024_881	%--	I mean , it it was just an idea . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , we
Bmr003_674	qrr	Yeah . ; yeah . ; So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ? ; Or is that really just a guess ?
Bro023_1690	b	but , um , the probability of speech is not computed the same way . ; And I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good speech probability is important . ; Like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as Sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1457	s	Yeah . ; There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . ; But by having them both there ; The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you .
Bmr006_255	%--	We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . ; but ; Right . ; But if there were such a
Bed015_2098	b	So you have nothing . ; Just a white piece of paper . ; Mmm , ; right .
Bsr001_1515	b	Is it the three , I see , ; Well , if you ha m u eh ; And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card ; mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1183	%	Sarcasm , ; Yeah , that 's right . ; how do you how do you indicate sarcasm ? ; Yeah that 's right .
Bmr006_1042	s	and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . ; I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . ; What what model ? ; Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer .
Bed013_1191	g	And we have our Info - on . ; So in my c my case , this would sort of make this happy , and this would make the Go - there happy . ; What you 're saying is we have a Where - X question , Where - X node , that makes both happy . ; Right ?
Bro024_1231	bk	OK . ; Is this is this VAD a MLP ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr013_837	aa	also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , ; Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . ; So this , blends nicely into the update on transcripts . ; Yes , it does .
Bmr013_555	b	There are all these kinds of functional , uh , elements . ; I don't know what you call them . ; But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr007_391	%--	But uh but but ; Were you were you were you were you measuring it ? ; I mean , w w were ; There there 's
Bmr015_707	b	And I I I I not sure that i eh , the the way o to ob the way to obtain the the instantaneous frequency is right , ; or it 's it 's not right . ; Eh , ; Yeah .
Bro011_741	b	Yeah . ; I was going crazy trying to do that . ; Huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1259	b	Just sort of huge . ; you know , slightly different ; What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this , ; Yeah .
Bro004_1016	%--	Um These are ; Did did did I interrupt you ? ; Yeah , I have one . ; Were there other things that you wanted to
Bmr006_595	s	How much ; Is there a difference in price or something ? ; Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , ; and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .
Bed002_1058	s	But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete . ; OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be , ; and we have some some data that 's loose , ; we can use our own intuition ,
Btr002_1856	b	Cuz I was giving a report on what the comments were , ; and it was one of these was this , ; s so ; Uh - huh .
Bro027_1606	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So that delay , plus the LDA . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_314	s	I purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern . ; Mmm . ; So ; And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly .
Btr001_1219	bk	You talking about the IBM ones ? ; Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF , ; that 's the Tigerfish . ; Right .
Bmr001_542	%--	Tony Robinson 's uh lossless compression thing . ; OK . ; What 's it do ? ; Um , it it does AR modeling
Bed005_883	s	Mmm . ; and - and - and tons of stuff . ; So , th the database is huge , ; and if we want to answer a question on that , we actually have to go one step before that , and understand that .
Bro022_516	s	Just listen very carefully to what I say ; and do the opposite . ; Including what I just said . ; And , yeah , that 's everything .
Bed010_75	cc	and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . ; So . ; This way we we worked around that . ; The , uh the system , um I can show you the system .
Bmr020_1544	b	And but , the numbers ; Oops . ; Um ; Hmm !
Bmr018_1523	s	Yeah . ; It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct . ; OK . ; But , I mean , yes .
Bmr006_274	s	True . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .
Btr001_1460	ba	Oh . ; Hmm , wow . ; And they type it on ; Makes it really hard .
Bmr025_189	s	Yeah that sounds good . ; And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally ; That sounds really neat . ; and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .
Bmr006_118	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Definitely . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_434	no	Right . ; So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight ; but do you think that , um that , uh , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . ; I have no idea .
Bed006_656	bk	This is the uh s the schema of the XML here , ; not an example or something like that . ; Yeah this is not an XML ; OK .
Bmr022_914	%--	Yep . ; Th - d ; Yes . ; Or what do they
Bmr031_1507	qw	OK - Anyway . I I should move on ; cuz we 're running late , ; Yeah . ; but I wanted to say there 's one question in my mind , which maybe Morgan can talk to Jeremy about , is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt .
Bed002_176	s	Um . ; Either one of those . ; And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . ; So , the most important form is the consent form ,
Bmr016_1280	s	And then the third type right now , uh , is m things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening . ; So it could be something like , you know , " referring to so - and - so " , ; " talking about such - and - such " , ; uh , you know , " looking at so - and - so " .
Buw001_1052	%--	I don't know . ; At ; Mm - hmm . ; I just don't
Bmr030_584	qh	Should talk to him about that . ; Or even a DVD burner . ; A DVD burner , yeah . ; I guess the real question is , where would we put it and who would do it ?
Bsr001_1872	b	Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues . ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1953	qw	it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular , ; although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds . ; I see . ; So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ?
Bro014_103	s	And when you have your final thing , we go back to this . ; Yeah . ; So , um , ; and it 's a real simple change to make .
Bmr006_634	s	OK , ; I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we ; I don't remember . ; Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .
Bmr022_1347	s	And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system . ; Yeah , that 's what I would be worried about too . ; Well , I think ; yeah , I think there are probably ways that you can say that , you know , only certain users are allowed to change things .
Bed013_1	aa	 ;  ; As usual . ; Yes .
Bro021_653	s	OK . ; and an epsilon cubed over three , ; and so forth . ; So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges .
Bmr002_1263	s	Well , I think to some extent with things like the stress and the other prosodic things ; So . ; Uh - huh . ; an and tighter time alignments that we can do
Bed009_761	%--	I I I d I 'm asking . ; I don't know . ; Yeah , uh the problem is th that it has to be very fast ; because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere
Bed011_92	s	And um and they have to read isolated proper names ; And these change ; S I don't see a release ; No , this is not the release form .
Bmr028_1380	s	or ; Right . ; You know . So she certainly can define it . ; Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments .
Bro024_543	%	" fifty percent relative performance " . ; For the clean training . ; Is that ; u
Bmr021_193	b	And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure , ; So . ; the SM - ten - A 's , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_788	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's the point . ; the the
Bmr010_1313	b	a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain , ; Yeah . ; which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1615	aa	OK . The the tea is is going , so , uh , I suggest we do , uh uh , a unison . ; A unison digits ? ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed005_514	s	OK . ; Point number two . ; I got the , uh , M - three - L for the routes today . ; Uh , so I got some more .
Bns001_1516	t3	I ; We have some content . ; We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned . ; Bless you .
Bro024_321	s	and so you might have some kind of general thing that 's your best guess to start with . ; But ; So , s I I ; you know , a lot of these things are proprietary
Bed005_1131	s	Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent ; I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take ; One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT . ; So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you ,
Bro004_249	%--	So . Yeah . ; Aha ! ; That 's interesting . That 's interesting . ; Do you see ? Because Uh ,
Bmr018_223	s	Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff ? ; Well the other stuff is I B ; Uh , ; I 'm just thinking that from a data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces .
Bro021_640	s	and and , uh , ; so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think , ; uh ; we may have to do this on a whiteboard ,
Bed013_1211	s	Yeah . ; and ; So un ; I change I changed my mind actually .
Bmr028_786	b	Input reader and an output stream . ; Oh , OK . So then you could use , um You could use , um uh , like Feacalc and s just specify as an output format ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_343	s	But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; So I wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before I increased the number of Gaussians .
Bro017_766	b	Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model , you put a constant . ; S yeah effectively what you 're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation . ; Right ? ; Oop .
Btr002_1319	bk	Oh , that 's right ! ; and you had to find them . ; You 'd have to find where the digits were . ; Oh .
Bro010_168	s	So it 's ; Uh , ; yeah , but then there 's ; plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA .
Bmr008_675	%--	I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever , ; Mm - hmm . ; But you know , just have it you know , a short simple form that you can categorize yourself in a in a systematic way . ; What about the the phrasing that um Chuck used , uh which was in in relation to the question I was trying to formulate of uh Where where did you what
Bro019_1407	b	um , I kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors I see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a um , Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end , um , and doing recognition . ; Um . ; So , that 's that 's just generally what I 've been looking at . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1039	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , just from We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment . ; You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words .
Bmr021_587	s	Right . ; So . ; You 're talking about different files . ; I mean , it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing
Bro018_34	s	No no , what feeds it ? ; What features does it see ? ; The feature the input ? ; The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature .
Bmr025_397	ba	I mean it 's different . ; So that 's ; I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data ; so it might be neat , you know .
Bro012_739	b	and um then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area . ; Something like that . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro012_840	b	You know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing ; and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light ; uh and and in some , there was low light , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_908	%--	Yeah . ; Well , ; there is also the spectral subtraction , ; which ,
Bed017_445	s	and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . ; Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , ; but the problem is obviously the scalability . ; And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network ,
Bed004_564	b	this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um ; we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content . ; Now , the content ; Hmm .
Bmr031_820	s	Uh , ; I could write on the board . ; OK . ; It combines categories .
Bed011_340	s	Right , I mean , once I start doing that I 'll have more to say about this kind of thing . ; OK . ; And y and always ; But well th but you did say something important , which is that um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with the simple cases for quite a while .
Bmr020_1047	b	you know in writing you have this two spaces and a big gap ; Mm - hmm . ; you know . ; Right .
Bmr002_1005	s	And I think I got this off the U Penn ; and it does in fact cite a French site , ; so um they have some sort of an arrangement . ; Well , I just wrote down the French site
Bed016_392	%--	one of Nancy 's st ; OK , I can give you a more recent if you want ; well , that might have enough . ; Uh , I
Bns001_1370	qh	Yep . ; Yeah . ; I want to have really the activities ; you know , what is really the outcome
Bro008_416	s	and we doesn't work , we remove these . ; Maybe we trying again with the articulatory feature . ; I don't know exactly ; because we tried we some one experiment that doesn't work .
Bmr024_105	co	OK . ; OK . ; Well , maybe uh , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . ; Someone can fill in Liz and Andreas later .
Bmr028_1424	%--	But , it it seems to me that u um , it does import some negative evaluation , that , um , would maybe not be good if ; It has some shock value . ; It has shock value , ; and
Bmr020_287	no	But I don't know if that 's really a fair way of comparing between , multi - party , conversations and two - party conversations . ; Then then then you have to ; Yeah . ; I I I don't know .
Bmr026_970	s	That 's That 's certainly one thing , yeah . ; And the dictionary made a huge difference . ; Uh . Yeah . ; Uh . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh to the dictionary about two years ago
Bro012_1119	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Also is Stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f to think about uh voiced - unvoiced ; to work uh here in voiced - unvoiced detection .
Bmr002_636	%--	So , we 're talking now , once you have words you know , how do you time align it . ; and that 's . ; Oh . So , these are p particularly for time alignment ? ; Well , these are uh tools
Bsr001_1461	%--	Right . ; So they 're gonna s say , you 're you 're having a meeting to do this . ; They 're going to be goal directed . ; You 're supposed to
Btr001_2734	d	That 's right , ; break it up more finely . ; Yeah . ; But if you can clearly hear pauses and there 've not been transcribed , we should be adding the commas or not ?
Bro023_715	bk	Mm - hmm . ; pick one . ; yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . ; VA Yeah , VAD .
Bsr001_353	2	Yeah . ; I , uh , ; I ; Your telephone ,
Bmr009_316	g	And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . ; e Actually , I was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap , ; but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , ; right ?
Bmr023_463	s	For all the Meeting Recorder data . ; We should have . ; Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . ; And then , Jane also s prepared a um , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to .
Bns003_1045	bk	one more time . ; Oh , again ? ; We have to do that ? ; Oh !
Bmr030_250	b	Yeah , so you see the pitch contours ; and you and when you hit play , like there 's a line that goes through it , ; you know , and it 's all aligned with like the t the audio and the feature file . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_269	aa	To some de ; uh what what part of th the SmartKom stuff ? ; Well , the parser , and that stuff . ; Oh yeah yeah .
Bro017_1122	s	Yeah . ; Maybe . ; And and do that for each one . ; Because you see , I mean , what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable ,
Bro016_212	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Wha - what 's a typical number ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1864	bk	Sunil in in your result it 's ; I I 'll try the cle ; No , I I my result is with the noisy noisy LDA . ; It 's with the noisy one .
Bmr027_473	s	we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ? ; Right . ; I mean , what are we gonna doing here ? ; It might well be the case that that this is perfectly you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply .
Btr001_1243	qw	Yeah . ; And they put paren ; um , not parentheses . ; What 's it called ?
Bmr005_189	ba	aren't you ? ; so it 's great . ; Right . ; So this is really great
Bmr016_1325	s	That that 's known as " found data " . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Acsu - actually yeah . ; I got It was stored in a place I didn't expect ,
Bmr003_582	d	you know , forty minutes to an hour , ; As a pilot study . ; and ; Yourself ?
Bed008_1124	b	Yeah , I mean ; it 's and I don't think it 's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , ; so le that 's a that 's a good ; Mmm yeah .
Bro012_977	b	OK . ; uh fff ; Well . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_373	aa	But about the need for transcription , ; I mean , don't we didn't we previously decide that the IBM transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ? ; So . Yeah . ; Yes . That 's true .
Bmr028_1745	b	there 's there 's no shortage of meetings , ; Yeah . ; But ; Yep .
Bro021_739	s	S so , I don't know , ; I was h ; I 'm I 'm I 'm , like ; that so that is the next thing . Once this I once I sort this pro uh , problem out maybe I 'll just go into that also .
Bmr023_596	b	I I I think ; Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bns001_367	s	How to use quality of service , you know , in advance , ; because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services . ; And that should not be done automatically . ; But it could be done automatically .
Bsr001_1042	b	I , you know ; There are no final ; I mean , the official decisions I guess have to be made in terms of resources to that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_10	%	Um , why don't we s again start off with with , ; uh , ; Yeah , I 'll get it . ; I 'll get the door .
Bed013_947	fa	Grateful for us ? ; uh ; Did you just say grateful for us ? ; OK , sorry .
Bro027_228	s	um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm , yeah . ; Uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data .
Bro005_503	ba	And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , d I have found more or less the same result . ; So , it 's slightly better ,
Bmr026_1199	s	It 's m It 's more than ; And a thousand is too small ? ; Oh let me think about it , ; but I think that that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns .
Bns002_724	s	Mm - hmm . ; and the article is is uh I think from from this year , ; and eh ; these guys are doing eh what they call uh " B - connected networks " ,
Bed013_809	aa	and pretend we have parsed it , ; and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side . ; Remember I came in and I started asking you about how we were sor going to sort out the uh , decision nodes ? ; Yes !
Bed014_306	s	And um ; Yeah , I 'll say it now . ; So , um ; And it looks to me like we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard .
Bed008_1431	s	or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , ; you know , ; I mean that seems like that 'd be weird , ; Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also .
Bed011_1120	s	No , we can w throw in an " Out of Film " construction if you want to , ; No , no , no . ; but ; Well the th the thing is there 's a lot that needs to be done to get this right .
Bmr030_843	%--	Um . ; I assume they 're in the P - make pool . ; Yeah . They 're in the P - make pool . ; So if you do a " reginfo minus show attribute " , and
Bmr012_802	b	And and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why ; so I was just ; and , you know , what ; Mmm .
Bed006_1129	b	uh I mean but very difficult . ; The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_224	fa	Yeah . ; From point ; Well , we tried we tried point one , ; I I 'm sorry
Bns002_1318	%--	So , let me let me just uh finish , you know . ; OK . ; Uh well , this is something I , more or less , I told you . ; and eh you know , the point , or or or
Bmr018_1351	qw	Yeah . ; Yeah , I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks . ; They seemed like a good group . ; What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ?
Bmr011_1368	b	and that 's a nice idea . ; because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed008_194	no	but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? ; Yeah , that 's a good question . ; And uh does it have a lazy mode ? ; I don't remember .
Bsr001_422	aa	Well ; What exactly is the purpose of the corpus ? ; Yeah , ; I agree .
Bro013_728	%--	Yeah . ; Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ? ; There are only zeros here . ; Well .
Bed009_113	b	It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand uh better what 's going on . ; Yes . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_173	br	Right . ; But I think one thing is that , uh , I would presume ; Hav - Have you ever t Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual TI - digits test set ? ; This exact same recognizer ?
Bro003_1888	s	Uh - huh . ; Uh , ; and , yeah . ; And the result was that apparently , when testing on cross - language it was better .
Bmr023_966	s	Um . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz ; Mm - hmm . ; and it just wasn't doing it , ; so now it is .
Bmr015_677	s	And not just because I 'm in there . ; No , it 's real interesting . ; Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting . ; Uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume ,
Bro014_123	b	OK . ; Oh . ; so I can't remember exactly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1103	s	that was hilarious . ; Yeah . ; Right when you were talking about that . ; You know , that wa that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged ,
Bmr012_766	s	Yeah , that 's ; And and feed them to feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if if the SRI front - end does something . ; Yeah . ; I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization ,
Bro022_1015	s	so I was p initially trying to clear them up . ; Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh , the initial frames were silence . ; It always started in the silence state , ; but it wasn't for some utterances .
Bmr011_903	s	uh , cuz , you know , I mean , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . ; He downloaded from the CD onto audio tapes . ; And apparently he did it one channel per audio tape . ; So each of these people is transcribing from one channel .
Btr002_819	s	Interesting . ; Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear It 'll be in right in the middle of the timebin , ; Hmm . ; and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again
Bns001_286	b	so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network . ; You can switch from UMTS or uh uh , to WaveLAN Technologies . ; Hmm . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bed006_1318	s	List all the parent categories . ; you know i ; list all the parent categories " . ; It 's just like a frame hierarchy ,
Bed015_321	no	Which is fine , yeah . ; It 's that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , ; Yeah . ; I I don't know if I ever explained this
Bed006_448	s	OK . ; Then I suggest we move on to the to ; we have um uh the EDU Project , ; let me make one more general remark , has sort of two two side uh um actions , its um action items that we 're do dealing with ,
Bed014_878	s	Uh ; Good luck . Really . ; So that , so th thi this I mean , so this is the point , is we we 're going to have to cycle through this , ; but th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal .
Bmr019_1835	ba	To Andreas , the idea is is good . s To eat here . ; Well ; Mmm . ; Wow .
Bro028_896	s	uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , uh , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about , ; and it was really just sort of setting of different constants . ; And it would turn , you know , one thing into another . ; It 'd turn Wiener filtering into spectral subtraction , or whatever .
Bmr027_1175	s	and I don't have to b go borrow it from someone ; and ; We have actua actually I have ; W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , I was I was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares ,
Bmr031_176	b	Um . So ; You know , this this raises some ; cuz it 's it 's a really nice graphic . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1780	bk	Ah . ; So that you bring in some information from the net itself . ; Right , ; OK .
Bro013_749	%--	Alright . ; I mean in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , " O " and " zero " . ; OK . ; But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if
Bns001_643	no	because then it j must be your uh Bible I would like to say that you are very familiar with UMTS if you wanna go in in that way . ; And As far as I know the UMTS standardization is not finished yet . ; Ninety percent , maybe , or eighty percent . ; I kno I 'm not sure .
Bmr006_869	bs	With the fan . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises .
Bmr001_241	aa	If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work . ; It 's Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker . ; I guess . ; Yeah .
Bed014_496	qw	Right . ; So these are either true or false ; and it 's also just true or false . ; If we encounter a phrase such as " where is X ? " , should that set this to true and this to true ,
Bro027_1793	bk	Is too high . ; too too high ; or ; Yeah .
Bro003_1712	s	Yeah . ; and , um , trying to have a closer look at the perhaps the , um , speech , uh , noise detection or , uh , voiced - sound - unvoiced - sound detection ; and Which could be important in i for noise noise ; I think that would be a I think that 's a big big deal .
Bed016_1123	t3	Hardly anything . ; So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant . ; I have to go . ; Alright . Yeah .
Bro005_1220	no	Yeah , but ; Yeah . ; So , yeah , but we 've ; I don't know .
Bed003_579	co	You don't have to do the whole thing that we did last time . ; Just like uh , maybe the fact that they use a certain verb ; OK . ; Actually forget the verb .
Bns002_301	s	But not to broadcast . Uh , to all the nodes . ; OK . ; For this for this eh , work , the transmitter has to send a a a reservation packet called RTS , " Request To Send " , before eh being able to send data . ; And the receiver is expected to return back another packet called CTS , " Clear To Send " , to allow the transmitter to send the data .
Bmr001_253	s	The the the underwater guys do this stuff which is different . ; And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible . ; Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation , you sort of you want them very close . ; And And the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's but it 's there .
Bro024_1306	%--	Yes . ; Or Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the next ,
Bmr016_829	s	That 's typical , huh . ; yeah , I don't know what 's typical here , ; but um , ; it 's local though ,
Bro004_354	b	So um ; Go ahead . ; Ah , while you 're gone I 'll ask s some of my questions . ; Yeah .
Bro022_338	bk	The mean . ; uh , r uh , then I don't see how that would make it louder . ; OK . ; Yeah ,
Bro021_995	b	mmm ; That doesn't follow . ; Well , we can put , uh , this ? ; Mmm .
Bro022_1086	%--	Yeah . ; And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now . ; OK . ; So it has , like the spectrogram has , like
Bmr031_843	bk	Rustle , rustle . ; the date on this one is July twenty - sixth , ; so , uh , I have to update it . ; A couple weeks ago . Yeah .
Bro022_1113	h	So . ; Yeah . ; That that 's it , Morgan . ; Uh ,
Bmr028_1339	s	It I guess it It 's been around for a long time , ; It really is ; It is . Yep . ; and it it 's sort of , um Because it 's so strong a word , people don't take it that seriously ,
Bro024_1273	%	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And ; That 's right .
Bmr013_656	%--	Yeah , m ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean
Bmr015_1177	%--	Yeah . ; if we had only linguistically - relevant things ; if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components , ; and , uh , we we didn't have noise ,
Bro022_595	s	Well , the first thing I that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . ; Uh . ; And maybe see with Andreas if ; Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model .
Bns003_579	s	Pending . ; Pending . ; Yeah . ; See for me it 's the same
Bro022_789	b	And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue . ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2658	bk	s Yeah . I was gonna say , I put ; OK . ; Oh . ; I see what you 're saying .
Bmr019_1719	b	Oh . ; Yeah . ; I d so I I jus ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_155	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push , ; but it seems like , ; OK , we 've got some models ,
Bns003_999	qy	But , currently there 's only one new group member , Sven Buchholz , who will figure out the thing , hmm how to say , um , the taking into account the end system , or the limited end system capabilities with respect to mobility and the network itself . ; Where it should be ada @ @ where should be , uh , the adaptation process performed to deal with the different devices , for ubiquitous access to the network ? ; Should it be in the end system itself ? ; Should be in the edge device ?
Bed003_618	co	OK . ; So let 's see . ; I want to query , ; " Go " and , right , " query " .
Bed014_113	s	You were gonna send me a note about hiring ; Yes . ; I didn't finish the sentence ; but he understood it .
Bmr029_682	s	and I can give you those to to process . ; OK . ; And there 's , um , ; S so the way this means subtraction expects to work , is it expects to have , um , this continuous stream of audio data from a particular speaker to operate on .
Bmr009_972	s	But . ; So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety . ; Yeah . ; You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great if you 're a linguist " .
Bmr019_1258	s	Yeah . ; Just sort of huge . ; you know , slightly different ; What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this ,
Bro005_1069	s	right ? ; If so , we can add this other stuff . ; Um . ; as an additional path
Bmr012_1291	aa	It 's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break ; yeah that 's right . ; and I think that 's a good idea , ; Yeah exactly ,
Bed011_1143	s	Yeah . ; He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town . ; Sure , OK . ; And um m making me incapable of going to NAACL , for which I had funding .
Bed005_74	aa	and Um ; N . ; You happy with that ? ; Well , yeah .
Bro008_60	b	Uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek ; because Hynek will be over there telling people what we did , ; so he should know . ; Mmm .
Bed003_1608	bc	Is Srini gonna be at the meeting tomorrow , ; do you know ? ; Maybe . ; The day after tomorrow .
Bmr002_842	co	Well . ; But that kind of thing I think we would probably want to extract automatically . ; And then I 'll be ; I mean , e this is , the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz .
Bed004_820	s	What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs . ; So all sorts of different tasks and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on . ; And that 's that would be the really pretty result . ; And pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with uh SmartKom ,
Bmr015_279	aa	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; So you got the note ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1105	ba	Yeah , exactly . ; So . ; So . ; And and th that 's actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags .
Bro023_758	s	And , uh , ; using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving ; but I don't have the results for all the cases with that . ; So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame ,
Bsr001_2413	s	That 'd be great . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , that 's a good idea . ; Funny .
Btr001_2202	g	It 's kinda like a shrug . ; Yeah , but it tends to happen ; It 's like a m it 's like a ; You know ?
Bmr021_318	aa	Oh really ? ; so ; I didn't know that . ; Right .
Bed009_548	b	um ; I think you 're gonna need ; We talked about this several times that that the the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end . ; hmm
Bmr029_870	s	Yeah . I don't think it 'll make a matter . ; Yeah . I think there was only a few ; OK . ; we thought to be the case .
Bmr007_1188	s	so in the consent form it says , well you we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're unhappy with , yeah . ; OK , and you can say ; OK . ; But you don't want to just totally excise it
Bro026_873	s	Um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point .
Btr001_651	b	but I 'm just throwing that out there . ; Hmm . ; It 's interesting . ; Huh .
Buw001_2178	bk	It 's not the same . ; But , so what ? ; It 's still it 's interesting for other reasons . ; OK .
Bro003_470	x	so so you take PLP and you you , uh , do it uh , you you , uh , use HTK with it with the transformed features using a neural net that 's trained . ; And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT . ; And that 's the ; Right .
Bed009_601	no	I showed you once the interac action between them among them in the deep map system ; Right . ; so a printout of the communication between those two fills up ; I don't know how many pages
Bro024_1164	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , there are two curves . ; Yeah . ; One curve 's for the close - talking microphone , which is the lower curve .
Bmr008_253	b	It 's just to allow . ; If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ? ; You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something . ; Yep .
Bed011_1070	s	Mm - hmm . ; so some lexical and some phrasal , and and , you know , ; Mm - hmm . ; whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .
Btr002_1500	%--	Oh . Does ; That doesn't ; I usually just don't use that , I think . ; Yeah , that skips
Bro018_16	s	OK , ; Yeah , we ; the Aurora system . ; yeah the Aurora system with the new filter , VAD or something like that .
Bro019_1200	s	But Doesn't help . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I really wonder though . ; I mean we 've had these discussions before ,
Bro005_1210	bd	Yeah , but I li ; But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we ; Well , I think My impression ; You you folks have been looking at this more than me .
Bro005_351	bk	but uh , the uh , Italian training . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Buw001_2104	s	Oh , they only did the far - field ? ; Yeah . ; I see . ; But they had multiple mikes
Bmr016_650	%--	Right , but when Chuck wore the lapel and Morgan was talking there 're a couple really long utterances ; where Chuck is saying a few things inside , ; and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well ; and so the rec you know , there 're error rates
Bmr028_457	bk	I think , maybe talk to him first in person ? ; That 's what I would think . ; He 's not around , is the only problem . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_169	b	Uh . Um . ; Anything from your side ? ; Uh , continuing readings we come Uh . We 're doing some background reading on phonetics . ; Uh - huh .
Bro010_181	qw	Hmm . ; Which there is there 's some discussion of . ; But ; What were they thinking of changing it to ?
Bed015_1715	g	Mm - hmm . ; d doesn't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , that whenever I say something I could preface that with " I think . " ; Yeah . ; Nuh ?
Bmr024_817	bk	We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on . ; So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent . ; Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , uh , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen . ; Yep .
Bro023_1068	s	OK . ; And then , uh , d uh , nine point , uh , one . ; Mm - hmm . ; And finally , uh , sixteen point five .
Bed002_1141	%--	Yeah . ; Sure . ; The the lib M - three - L library does that . ; And the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l We 'll have to l
Bed008_325	bk	Right . ; OK , why don't we ch can we change that ? ; We can just rename that , yeah . ; Alright .
Bro005_1153	s	You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . ; You had reverb for a single variable ; which was re uh , uh , reverberation . ; Here the problem seems to be is that we don't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data .
Bro026_857	b	And ; y yeah , yeah , ; a dendrogram tree . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_941	s	OK . ; So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week . ; He 'll be here for about six months . ; And he 's done some work using an auditory model of , um , human hearing ,
Bro003_1521	%--	But , uh , ; we 've put another I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch . ; But , uh , ; are you saying
Bmr008_1692	b	That they 're much longer than I expected . ; But this is very short . ; Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds . ; Yeah .
Bed005_934	s	Right . ; OK ? ; Right . ; And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things .
Bro022_861	b	and zero crossings , for instance uh , would give you some better performance . ; Right ? ; Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or , uh stop consonants , or something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1002	%--	Um , and ; one thing that I didn't do consistently , um , is when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . ; I think I have an idea of what it should be ; but th
Bro022_643	bk	You you were HTK . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; OK .
Bed016_892	bk	No , it 's the bakery itself ; is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? ; Oh . ; Oh , oh yeah . Yeah ,
Bro021_3	qo	OK . ; Uh . ; Somebody else should run this . ; I 'm sick of being the one to sort of go through and say , " Well , what do you think about this ? "
Bro018_384	s	So it 'll go down to uh to the natural log being ; So the lowest value for this would be zero . ; So y you 're restricted to being positive . ; And this sort of smooths it for very small energies .
Bed002_649	bk	how to extract them . ; OK . ; So , f let 's find out which ones we need first , ; Got it .
Bmr003_1093	b	Mm - hmm . ; We 'll have to mix them . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1353	aa	Yeah . ; Do digital ones ? ; Uh OK . ; Yeah .
Bro027_570	s	ten milliseconds for LDA filter , ; and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? ; For the frame I guess . ; I computed two - twenty
Bmr012_1238	ba	Wow . ; I j and this I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something ; that 's good . ; that 's good .
Bmr018_1159	b	Oh , OK . ; That might might have been the one one of the ones that we did . ; Bef - What I mean is Wednesday , Thursday . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_171	s	Oh . ; So ; Oh . ; so in reality , if you put this this system in into , uh , the field , it would be twenty - four hundred bits per second , not forty - eight hundred .
Bro016_21	s	uh , as far as I know , ; so ; OK . ; There we go .
Bmr003_1533	s	so I was saying , like " and I could label this one left . ; Right ? " ; And he and he said , " I don't see anything " . ; And he said he said , " I wasn't talking to you " .
Bmr015_641	s	Mm - hmm . ; because when it 's ; Sure . ; a b backchannel could well happen in a very densely populated overlap .
Bed004_732	s	OK , ; which can then be uh applied at what we would call the simulation or action end . ; So you now know what you 're gonna do ; and that may actually involve getting more information .
Bro018_497	s	and ; uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training . ; So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want . ; And uh it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings ,
Bed005_651	%--	tu uh , tur change the description to , uh , English ; OK . ; and , um , ; Then then ,
Bmr003_635	s	I mean , cuz we 're we ; I have such a hard name . ; I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves . ; Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting .
Bmr005_860	b	But uh , having having somebody have some experience , again , with with uh with marking it from a human standpoint , ; we 're I mean , I don't expect Jose to to do it for uh f fifty hours of of speech , ; but I mean we if uh if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it . ; Yeah . Sure .
Btr002_150	s	Ah . ; Which is interesting . ; Oh . ; And and , you know , this was a case where the timebin was off .
Bro004_1293	b	Because anyway when we go to twice as much data and have the same number of parameters , ; particularly when it 's twice as much data and it 's quite diverse , ; um , I wonder if having twice as many parameters would help . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_239	t3	One point four ? ; If I Yeah . ; So , it 's an additional thirty percent . ; What would you say ?
Bmr007_323	s	I should also say I did a simplifying , uh count in that if A was speaking B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again , ; I I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap , and it was A being overlapped with by D . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the f the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing .
Bmr022_1162	b	That 's right . ; So the question is s w ; And then after that , then this would probably work . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_420	bk	Liz , you could also just use the other mike if you 're having problems with that one . ; N ; Well . ; OK .
Bmr001_157	b	A cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that . ; Yeah , I mean , you know , we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it . ; I mean . ; Yeah .
Bns003_42	b	Eh ; in principle , in his spare time . ; Yeah ! ; Yeah .
Bmr031_751	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's what I meant , ; Well , they have the two gig already . ; yeah .
Bro024_785	s	I 'm I 'm showing now an envelope ; um ; maybe you 'll f for this time . ; So usually you have maybe in clean condition you have something which looks like this .
Bmr027_318	bk	but I had the feeling I should probably respond ; and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date , ; and if you don't hear from me by then " You know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . " ; Right .
Bmr001_538	s	Probably , we could we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win . ; I think that 's a good ; Run what on those ? ; Shorten .
Bro023_1542	s	So you take sixty - four millisecond F F Ts and then you average them over five hundred ? ; Or ? ; Uh , what do you do over five hundred ? ; So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds ,
Bmr019_828	s	No . ; And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand ; So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber ; and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances .
Bro012_845	qo	Mm - hmm . ; And the variance is just sort of like the next moment , ; you know ? ; So uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times ,
Bmr005_778	%--	You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , ; or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . ; I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time . ; Well , that 's what I wonder , because um
Bmr031_1148	s	Mm - hmm . ; preparing for quals . ; Uh , hopefully second week of September if I can ever get Warren Sack to answer my emails . ; I probably shouldn't say that on the tape .
Buw001_2072	%	and said that those are nothing like these meetings . ; Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data . ; And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1611	%--	and we do have ; I mean , ; yeah , ; so so you
Bmr018_1042	s	So we need some way to push these first chunk of meetings into a state where we get good alignments . ; Absolutely . ; I 'm probably going to spend another day or so trying to improve things by , um , by using , um , acoustic adaptation . ; Um , the Right now I 'm using the unadapted models for the forced alignments ,
Bed014_1334	s	I have to catch up with him , and I wanted t to get a feeling for that . OK . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know .
Bmr026_15	qy	and that it 's gone out to the transcribers ; and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . ; Um Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . ; C can I have a pen ?
Bro012_440	no	yeah . ; What 's a little bit ? ; Like ; Like , it 's difficult to say
Bmr030_536	s	It can be delay on the disk , ; or it can be just load gets high on the machine . ; Yeah . ; Um , either IO load or processor load .
Bmr019_1513	ba	I mean , it 's a ; It got better . ; Yeah . ; That 's the important thing .
Bmr020_267	bk	Exactly . ; So but still but still u ; It 's i it 's not against his conclusion , ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_1616	%--	Ruff ruff ! ; Yeah I also thought of there there are really some channels where it is almost um , only bre breathing in it . ; Yeah ? ; And to to re - run 's
Bed008_1032	aa	or ; Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model ; but , you know , directly out of interaction . ; Right .
Bmr015_329	s	It 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; My favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , uh , " you know , this should be far more detailed " ,
Bmr028_1217	%--	W we just We save ; Yeah . It 'd be interesting just to see i how much it changes . ; Well , the the ; just to h
Bmr018_373	s	Yes . ; Yes . ; and they have multiple , ; uh , well , let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet .
Bmr023_98	s	So . ; But , you know , which opportunity should we ; Yeah . ; Unison .
Bed005_1226	bk	Well , the " OR " . ; Same . ; Right . I guess you 're right . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_639	s	OK . ; This was all ; Yeah . ; So . Yeah , th th that was the question .
Bmr002_1400	s	but I mean this is just wonderful , the uh added level of yeah , compactness in the channels . ; If we can do anything with it , yeah . ; Yep . ; I do find myself whispering .
Bro024_1682	bk	I mean , you start up with the with the somehow with the noisy envelope . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , best is to smooth this somehow . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2366	s	right . ; d ; yeah . ; If you definitely shouldn't use your last sample .
Bro018_263	b	If you 're getting fifty - six here , try adding together the probabilities of all of the voiced phones here and all of the unvoiced phones ; will be ; and see what you get then . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1578	s	It 's not so bad . ; Right . ; And Robustness has a fair amount , ; but the NSA group is just very very many .
Bmr007_486	s	I mean , children don't adjust so well , ; I mean , if a truck goes rolling past , adults will well , depending , but mostly , adults will will will hold off to what to finish the end of the sentence till the till the noise is past . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think we generally do monitor things like that , about whether we whether our utterance will be in the clear or not .
Bro003_562	s	yeah . ; But , actually , the issue of phoneti phon uh phone phoneme mappings will arise when we will do severa use several languages ; Yeah . ; because you Well , some phonemes are not , uh , in every languages ,
Bed006_932	b	So meaning ; Great . ; That 's exactly what is necessary . ; Yeah .
Bro014_997	bk	No . ; No , the idea was , I guess , to to use them as as features . ; Features . ; I see .
Bmr005_895	%	I 'll think about it , ; and try to remember . ; And it might be different for government people . ; That 's alright .
Bmr003_1361	b	Right . ; Great . ; If you if you speak TCLTK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_707	bk	Uh - huh . ; but ; But a as I was saying , people do get probabilities from these things , ; OK .
Bro026_736	bk	Yeah , that 's just one more . ; Is this their , um , SVM recognizer ? ; No , it 's just a straightforward HMM . ; Oh , OK .
Bed006_329	t3	If not , we can move on . ; No ? ; No more questions ? ; So what 's the s this is what you made , Fey ?
Bmr016_1065	s	Yeah . ; It 's it 's just ; So we just ; If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive
Bmr012_1257	s	that 's a great idea . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , exa exactly ; I guess nested several layers ,
Bmr003_2278	s	The the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet . ; Mm - hmm . ; In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is . ; That cabinet can can go away .
Bro028_381	b	OK . ; I mean We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges ; because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition . ; Uh - huh .
Bed006_771	%--	that doesn't hurt the current way . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; which is
Bmr013_673	b	But , once that 's moved over , uh , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , um , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . um , on the word strings . ; Oh , shoot ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro010_233	s	To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . ; And and , uh , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually . ; I mean , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server ; and , uh , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . It doesn't seem like it 's that big a deal .
Bed016_749	bk	So . ; Well , unless he was repairing it or something , ; but yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_938	b	and if he has a student who 's interested , ; and how much infrastructure we 'll need . ; I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it . ; Yeah .
Bed011_247	s	So this is a question for you , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , you know , if we if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype , uh ; probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway .
Bro003_221	%--	I mean cuz th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone . ; Telephone . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the
Bsr001_828	b	Yeah . ; and then you can degrade it by using the P Z ; Yeah , yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro008_216	s	Yeah , ; it 's very short interval . ; yeah . ; So , I think the who the whole reason for having as long as we have , which was like a week and a half , is is because of bugs like that .
Bed005_837	s	Right . ; and the person talking is trying to , I don't know , give you a statement and tell you something . ; And here , it 's th ; Help you create a mental model , blah - blah - blah .
Btr001_83	s	Yeah . ; I don't know . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly .
Bmr014_466	s	It would be separate ; The letters would be separated in space ; OK . ; and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards
Bro016_873	s	Mm - hmm . ; Anything else ? ; Yeah . But , ; my my point was more that it it works sometimes
Bmr022_1047	s	And so the only way to do that is with , uh S - hosts , ; which is insecure . ; Hmm . ; So we still have to sort of look at it a little bit .
Btr001_2623	s	Oh . ; you know exactly what the person should have said ; and you check to be sure , ; and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked .
Buw001_537	s	And then they would say " well , we talked about this ; Hmm . ; and then we talked about that , ; and so - and - so talked about "
Bro012_325	b	and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time ; I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1460	bk	Maybe we have to extend it then , ; and figure out some real scenarios , ; and maybe then pfff ! ; Oh yeah .
Bro025_417	s	Did that help then ? ; It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . ; So that 's why this improvement I got from the last result . ; So . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch ,
Bro004_80	co	Oh wait wait wait wait wait . Wait . ; Get out of the ; Yeah . ; Hold on .
Bns002_1423	s	and um ; The the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes . ; And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view is that we will have the um Wireless access networks for the next generation will be more flexible . ; There 's a @ @ for uh current uh uh uh for for fast changes within this network .
Bmr006_1179	s	Is that not allowed with this project ? ; Uh , well , no , I mean , we we don't have any rules , r really . ; But I didn't mean I w Given given the goal . ; I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question .
Buw001_66	b	So ; Oh , this thing . ; That 's it . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1102	s	so ; And I sent the path . ; maybe using those as references ; because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters .
Bro014_1264	s	when I was saying " well , it 's ; yeah , ; it 's the excitation " . ; But it 's not really the excitation .
Bmr020_899	aa	Clever . ; Yes . ; Clever . ; Yeah .
Bro025_529	%--	Yeah , I guess . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; No , I mean
Bed005_19	s	Th - this this is s should be im it isn't There 's another thing going on of gathering data , ; and that 's pretty much independent of this . ; But , uh , I just want to make sure we 're all together on this . ; What we think is gonna happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now we 're gonna get Fey to , where you 're working with me and Robert , draft a note that we 're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying , " here 's an opportunity to be a subject .
Bmr016_1608	s	Uh - huh . ; w except for that last thirty minutes I haven't checked yet . ; So CTS is really big here , ; Yeah , I wonder what it is .
Bmr012_1213	s	But that 's that 's a great idea ; and then just sort of have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever ; and and uh ; Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other
Bmr006_773	%--	You need truth . Hmm . ; Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with . ; Yeah . ; I 've gotta ask you . So , uh , the difference between the top two , i
Bed015_1209	%--	And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? ; Well , maybe there are other things . ; You know , now that it 's subject is more like a topic . ; And now that , you know
Bmr012_891	s	so ; Hmm . ; Oh OK . ; that 's how I know that .
Buw001_1826	%--	but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel . ; OK . ; OK . ; Um , other
Bed005_761	aa	Right . ; Or is that ; Yeah , that would be fine . ; Right .
Bmr014_124	s	I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , ; I mean . ; Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . ; I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .
Bro005_1255	%--	Sunil ? ; Yeah . ; He was doing something new ; or ?
Bmr028_615	s	There 's there 's th ; Mm - hmm . OK . Sure . ; So . I wou I would use th ; We can try them all and see which works better .
Bmr016_631	s	Mm - hmm . ; That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ? ; Chuck on the lapel , ; so Chuck wore the lapel three out of four times .
Bmr020_1541	%--	the the problem is that , nnn , the numbers Ian gave in the paper is just uh , some frame error rate . ; So that 's that 's not really What will be effective for for the transcribers , is ; They have to yeah , in in they have to insure that that 's a real s spurt or something . ; And but , the numbers
Bed006_1664	s	I think you 've got one on hand , ; huh ? ; yeah . ; I have several in my head ,
Bro024_1421	s	and I have two cases d where The first case is where the constant is twenty - five DB below the mean speech energy ; and the other is thirty DB below . ; Um , ; and for these s two system we have like fifty - five point , uh , five - percent improvement ,
Bro007_570	qrr	Anyway ; OK ; well I I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about ; or or are we done ?
Bed013_1333	s	Mmm . ; and so forth . ; Or do you actually , ; I mean this is perfectly legitimate ,
Bmr031_792	b	But the University of Hawaii has issued a request . ; Yep . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . That that needs a month , ; yeah ,
Bed006_1613	qw	And um ; So already again this week , ; huh ? ; How diligent do we feel ?
Bmr018_1564	%--	But ; No , but there was still a spread . ; So they 're all approaching . ; They weren't all up
Bed015_1664	aa	Yeah . ; So that that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1103	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK . ; Part of it comes from the user model . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1095	s	This ; Hmm . ; Sorry . ; but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that
Bmr014_34	bh	In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , ; and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , ; so I ; Oh really .
Bed015_1233	%--	Mm - hmm . ; There 's some negation . ; But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold , ; and you 're just talking , you know
Bro004_105	b	I mean uh phonetically ba ; phonetically balanced uh data and task data . ; We only did either task task data or uh broad data . ; Mmm .
Btr002_1302	s	Right . ; So . ; But i it was , um , really rather minimal . ; I mean , I I like that interface .
Bmr027_1262	s	Um , this is always a suspect phrase . ; But , um , no . I , uh I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , ; so we 're probably gonna need a lot more ; We 're probably gonna need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive .
Bmr006_218	aa	Yeah . ; OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get . ; I mean , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , ; Yes , that 's fine .
Bmr016_100	d	And ; Right ? ; So if you if if you have uh ; Six dash one , you mean ?
Bmr031_873	g	Oh . ; That 's after the meeting participants have gone through it . ; So I should probably send those to you , ; shouldn't I ?
Bro012_415	aa	I mean , it 's not it 's not that different , ; right ? ; I mean , just subtract the accuracy . ; Yeah
Bmr019_180	s	um ; But but , I have I mean , people people at SRI are actually working on digits . ; I bet it would do even slightly better . ; I could and they are using a system that 's , um you know , h is actually trained on digits ,
Bed008_228	b	And um ; Oops . ; Is ; hmm
Bro021_1000	bk	That I mean , that the f top one does not imply the second one . ; The top ? ; Because cuz the log of a sum is not the same as th ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Btr002_55	s	Thank you . ; Oh , there 's Hold on . ; which ; um , so there 're a couple of examples .
Bmr018_1107	s	It 's full . ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; You said , " Speaking about energy " , or something .
Bro003_757	ar	Finnish . ; And Italian . ; Where did th where did that come from ? ; Uh , no , Italian no .
Bro004_416	t3	Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , ; but but , um , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? ; I mean no no mixture but just ; I 'll get it for you .
Bmr022_1025	s	Yep . ; I mean , what I was envisioning was a PDA with a cellular link in it . ; You know , with one of the r short - range wireless . ; And let th Just do capture the audio on the PDA and send the audio over the wireless net .
Bmr018_948	s	OK . ; Anyways , so I I guess ; That Maybe that 's an interface issue that might be addressable . ; But I think it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me ,
Bed013_785	s	Mm - hmm . ; And people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit . ; Yeah . ; So this will be sort of documenting what we think , and documenting what we have in terms of the Bayes - net stuff .
Bro027_1189	%	Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect , ; but . ; Uh , ; Yeah , uh
Buw001_1574	%	We 'll just do it and see what happens . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_136	bk	So , ; if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed003_474	s	It it can take values in the set of all verbs , that they could possibly use . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um " nice walls " is binary , ; " closed " is binary
Buw001_2235	bk	I 'm gonna pass ; because I can't ; I mean , of the Jane took my answer . ; Ah !
Bmr031_1625	s	Yeah . ; Right ? ; We 're just gonna we we 're gonna use like thresholding or something . ; No , I understand .
Bro008_170	bk	Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on . ; Oh . ; So ; Oh .
Btr002_1591	s	or ; You know ? ; Mm - hmm . ; The little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people 's voices
Bmr011_1835	%--	that experiment he did a while back ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . You can , um ; The problem is just that the acoustic
Bmr003_1940	g	" Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . " ; b but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking ? ; No ; You 're talking about writing HTML , right ?
Bed017_419	qw	So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , ; um , what kind of software is the person using , ; which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , ; um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's
Bmr031_967	s	So . ; Um . ; So , what 's SmartKom ? ; Nothing this week .
Bro022_287	b	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed013_937	t1	uh - huh . ; User . ; And for example w i s I Irena Gurevich is going to be here eh , end of July . ; User .
Bmr006_1128	b	Yeah . ; And so , if you can get @ @ Uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect , uh in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_322	s	Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people . ; But but I think , you know , the main thing is just to , ; uh uh uh uh , it 's not a it 's not a conference . ; It 's not a workshop , really .
Bmr010_1354	bk	And , I I have prepared the the pitch tracker now . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I hope the the next week I will have , eh , some results and we we will show we will see , eh , the the parameter the pitch , eh , tracking in with the program . ; I see .
Bed017_321	aa	And um , ; until then we 'll come up with a something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you . ; Right ? ; OK .
Bns002_509	%--	Yeah . ; So , his transmission is aborted . ; Yeah , but this is typical for MAC layer protocols , you know . ; Not
Bed003_1122	s	Up one . ; Yeah . ; Ah yes , good . ; " Source " .
Bmr028_509	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know . ; I mean
Bmr028_477	%--	She 'll fix ; And it ; M ; And , uh , then there 's still m um
Bro025_82	s	But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Uh , and so , uh , th the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much .
Bmr013_912	s	but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . ; So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer ; and we can , can run these . ; So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data .
Bmr028_1146	ba	Well , of course it was a bug . ; But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty f f It was pretty funny anyway . ; But still ; Wow . Interesting .
Bro024_1002	s	Or ? ; Th - Well , this is ; u Uh , may ; Yeah , I mean , I talked to to uh , I ta Uh , I talked , uh , about it with with Hynek .
Bed016_310	s	I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , ; um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , ; and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here ; and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy .
Bed013_665	ba	um , um , ; don't make any plans for spring break next year . ; That 's ; Oh , shoot .
Bmr024_227	s	So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it . ; Alright . ; So , we have a whole bunch of digits , ; if we wanna move on to digits .
Bmr022_1289	b	You wait to the point when you 're ready to release it , ; and then you put it in the repository ; Yeah , so the w ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1417	b	I mean there 's there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . ; But ; But ; Yeah .
Bed014_1083	s	That 's fine . So we might continue our email thing ; Yeah . ; and that might be fine , too . ; So , maybe I 'll send you some
Bmr021_271	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah that 's right , we gotta get the obligatory door - slam . ; Oh well . ; No - not quite a slam .
Bsr001_1543	s	Well , there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually , you know they have to come to one solution . ; So actually have ; Yeah , ; and they all just have their own they just happen to have their own opinions .
Btr001_1770	s	Right . ; but it 's still a laugh . ; you know ? ; It 's No , like ,
Bmr031_492	%--	uh , you know , doing a bunch of things , ; maybe , you know , why why throw it away if you don't need to ? ; Um , on the other hand , ; um , I mean ,
Bro012_489	bk	Ah ! OK . Ah , ah . ; Hmm . ; Sorry . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2228	b	Cuz I have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while , ; but th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1522	b	Yeah . ; To overrule , yeah . ; So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_156	qw	or um . ; Do yo I mean , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? ; OK . ; How much of this do you need ?
Bro024_1211	b	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; There first , a threshold on the probability @ @ That puts all the values to zero or one . ; Mmm .
Bmr002_1469	b	We 've got two hours of space now . ; He he he changed the downsampling . ; Oh really . ; Yeah .
Bed015_195	s	Anyway , so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word , ; No , but ; Mm - hmm . ; just meaning .
Bed015_1592	aa	because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , i ; Yep .
Bmr026_1264	%--	So . ; Alright . ; Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . ; Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of
Bro015_174	s	Yeah . ; Dave ? ; Well um . One thing in in the paper Avendano and his collaborators wrote is that is that um they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant in speech by um subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude over a two second window . ; But they didn't do anything with the phase , and they said perhaps that limited their approach that it did not try to normalize the phase in any way .
Bro024_796	s	And then I think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this ; uh ; in in the models . ; I mean , i you you train it also this way
Bed013_1145	s	or th the ontology will tell us where actually it is located ? ; No . Not at all . ; OK . ; Where it is located , we have , a user proximity node here somewhere ,
Bro018_771	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and this i their their idea was to first find a mapping from MFCC 's to uh phonological features ; and then later on , once you have these phonological features , then uh map that to phones .
Bro012_1111	s	H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next , ; back back in the country . ; So . ; And start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth ,
Bro028_1010	s	uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things . ; So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try . ; The primary features , um , are in fact ; Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , uh , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that .
Bro028_517	s	This is on clean test set ? ; This is on clean on clean stuff . Yeah . ; They they 've started a table where they 're showing their results on various different noise conditions ; but they they don't have a whole lot of it filled in
Bmr022_1256	b	Hmm . ; That 's interesting . ; So the problem with RCS is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't , ; Yeah .
Btr001_2736	h	Yeah . ; But if you can clearly hear pauses and there 've not been transcribed , we should be adding the commas or not ? ; Though the one I 'm working on now is like that . ; Well
Bro012_1267	%--	Mmm . ; I I missed that . ; Right ? ; I guess what you could do , maybe
Bro028_241	s	Uh , yeah . ; for a second stream ? ; But , um , we we did a first try with this , ; and it it clearly hurts .
Bmr025_242	%	Right . ; Wow . ; I hope he never listens to these meetings . ; That 's right .
Bmr015_200	b	But , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_652	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they 're gonna have mikes like that too . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_762	no	It didn't , um , help dramatically . ; Were they out of balance ? ; The ; I didn't I didn't notice .
Bns002_151	bk	It is the way of topology changes can happen . ; The idea that mmm , any change is possible at any given moment . ; But you can of course ask , " but if the nodes are not moving , what kind of topology changes can we expect ? " ; Yeah .
Buw001_751	aa	Mm - hmm . ; and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . ; So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_374	aa	Oh , the new ones ; Yeah . ; with the tighter boundaries . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_317	s	So we are learning quite a lot about that . ; Hmm . ; And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using , ; I mean the so the minimum is one .
Bed008_379	b	Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , ; for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um ; Right . ; Right .
Bro023_142	bk	So that if you have very long utterances you have the best , ; Yeah . ; but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can . ; Right .
Bmr010_487	b	Yeah . ; So , ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1189	b	We should definitely set up ; Yeah . ; Do we have a mailing list that includes uh the OGI people ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_479	x	Hmm . ; But I th ; So , yeah , I think that 's that 's a good point , ; th th that the date , the , uh ,
Btr001_2229	%	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; That 's true . ; But .
Bmr018_97	s	A week from Saturday . ; Yeah , ; within ten days . ; That 's when they 're coming .
Bro005_665	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , ; the number of frames is bad also , ; so we have one million and a half for some ,
Bmr029_677	%--	Ah . OK . ; So , we need to run ? ; OK . ; Well , once we have the new , uh
Bed006_1703	%--	It 's an a attempt to refine it basically . ; And yeah , ; OK , great uh - huh . ; it 's an an it 's it 's sort of
Bmr019_601	s	I mean , ; Yeah . That was gonna be my question . ; we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well ; but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using to working with .
Bmr022_170	b	It would be very good . ; Um ; Yes , it would be , cuz it 's very , very regular . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_299	%--	Yeah . ; but this obvious thing to see if if there 's a dependence on the number of uh participants . ; Good idea . ; I mean
Bro004_925	s	or ? ; Uh , how are you how are you coming up with ; If you say uh If you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you ; It - It 's the single net ,
Bed016_633	s	Mm - hmm . ; Because you will find " run into , " ; uh , ; Cars run into telephone poles all the time .
Bmr022_1054	qy	because it 's gonna be a problem a lot of people have . ; But , um ; Who Well , we 're s talking about a fairly limited group , ; are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have accounts ?
Bed002_1283	b	which would be great . ; So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . ; Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building , ; Mmm .
Bed008_475	bk	Say w w well it 's co I would s a a ; again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . ; Someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business . ; OK .
Bmr009_521	s	The ? ; Pitch related ? ; Harmonicity and so on ? ; I I 'm preparing the the program but I don't I don't begin because eh I saw your email
Bmr016_1892	s	I have the there 're various things like " breathe " versus " breath " versus " inhale " and , hhh , ; you know , I don't know . ; I I think they don't have any implications for anything else ; so it 's like I 'm tempted to leave them for now
Bed011_308	%--	I mean w we have tested this and a y ; have you heard listen to the f first two or th ; as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup . ; And
Bed017_674	ar	So I did some double checking ; and it seems like spring break in two thousand one . ; Talk about changing the topic . ; No .
Bro012_535	qy	But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case ; So . ; Yeah . ; Uh . Do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?
Bns002_424	g	if now two has uh mmm answer with the with the CTS , it will be waiting until the data that has to come . ; Yeah ? ; OK , ; OK ?
Bed003_1207	%--	And actually I was ; cuz I got a wireless mike on . ; So a more general thing than " discussed admission fee " um , could be ; I I 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be
Bmr031_280	2	And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there . ; Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their backchannels ; Yeah . ; Just from word choice ?
Bns001_468	s	Yeah . ; Yep . ; But it might be the wrong thing to promise , uh , ten megabits to everywhere . ; There you are .
Bed008_767	b	but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free ; cuz you ; And so is approaching . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_972	b	Uh , you can just use it from the ; Yeah . Basically from the command line , ; and the defining the phones , whatever you want to have synthesized , ; Oh .
Bro014_183	b	this uh , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's two mixtures per state . ; So this just adds one . ; Except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_816	%--	or , " who 's pushing proof " ; Nuh . ; er , just pick pick any of them ; and just do the eh
Bmr011_993	s	Uh - huh . ; you know , like we just did , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , um , here 's , uh , a a , uh , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it .
Bsr001_1162	s	That 's right . ; It could be . ; It 's ; it 's like you 're behind closed doors
Bmr020_832	s	Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version , ; yeah . OK . ; Yeah , ; because I mean I I think Liz decided to go ahead with the downsampled versions cuz we can There was no s like , r significant difference .
Bmr014_300	s	I don't know if Dave is on the list , ; if he 's invited to these meetings , ; uh ; I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .
Bns003_362	qw	then what else did I have ? ; Then ; another point 's like , uh , what about the bank , ; uh , so , transferring your money from Europe t over here , what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something .
Bro023_602	%	So I think this shows that there is still work ; Uh , well , working on the VAD is still still important I think . ; Yeah , ; c
Bmr024_1598	s	Early July ? ; Late July ? ; Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth . ; Sixteen to eighteen , I think .
Bmr006_1282	b	Subtract them . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed004_580	s	or the whatever ; Uh , " approach " , you called it , I think this time . ; uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in . ; That 's what you said
Bro026_449	s	No , it 's in parallel . ; Para ; S ; We 're not talking about computation time here .
Bns003_231	s	And that means really to the project proposal itself and also maybe to the USAIA architecture , ; in that sense , that at certain stages , cuz it 's a general architecture , certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks , that it is related to these kind of things . ; Um , having uh , I what I have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system . ; That 's my principle concern ,
Bmr028_308	s	Tcl . ; Right ? ; Y I mean , John Osterhaut , uh Y you know , he started his own company based on Tcl stuff , ; and maybe they have the native code compiler or something .
Bsr001_2029	%--	um . ; Well , but that 's that was coincidence , right ? ; So , ; But that
Bro010_903	b	for example , discriminating between phones ; Mm - hmm . ; and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_218	s	OK ? ; So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one . ; or at least it has the drawbacks um , um , I was telling you . ; Eh , let 's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks ,
Bro027_1524	s	Yeah , ; and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , ; and so , I ; that 's what made me wonder about this ,
Bmr027_1482	s	And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process ; the , um ; when he can get these ; You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous
Bro023_606	b	Uh ; Can I ask just a a high level question ? ; Can you just say like one or two sentences about Wiener filtering and why why are people doing that ? ; Hmm .
Bed015_347	bd	Yeah . ; but that 's OK . ; I mean , we we we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh with , a p ; Uh , we don't mind either ,
Bro022_239	bk	In thi in this room ? ; On , uh , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ? ; Uh ; Y Yeah .
Bed016_753	b	But um . ; Uh , but OK . ; So in terms of the this ; I see .
Bmr005_118	b	Uh , he was he he you know We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically ; Yeah . ; and then uh meet again . ; Yeah .
Bns003_487	s	like where we could s uh , announce talks which are , you know , future talks for the future , ; or and where we could also have a link on for instance the two workshops which have going on , uh , last summer , ; so , Hannes ' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver , ; that there might be a link behind these workshops and or former talks we have ,
Btr002_3096	s	Oh , you have ? ; Yeah ? ; Remember that ? ; I 've never heard the swearword versions .
Bro024_567	bk	and in the clean training also it gives it ; But this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech . ; So n s So since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with , it 's easier to get a better relative improvement . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1434	aa	phone meetings or something . ; Or meetings like this with about the meetings . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah ,
Bmr007_112	s	At the very end , this is when people were , you know , packing up to go basically , ; there 's this final stuff , ; I think we I don't remember where the digits fell . ; I 'd have to look at that .
Bmr021_789	s	but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it . ; And then , you know , so we have the the SRI front - end ; and the ICSI front - end ; and other than that the system configuration was identical .
Bed017_720	s	and as compelling as a video game , ; then that would have a huge social impact " . ; I said , " Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . " ; Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it .
Bmr030_192	%--	Hmm . ; So . ; Wow ! ; Yeah , it was fine . I think y
Bmr006_109	b	As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . ; I 'd like to have many different speakers . ; So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_568	s	Does anyone ? ; I mean , Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , ; I ; Dan ?
Bmr028_801	s	Great . ; So , then it 's t uh , tandem experiments after that ? ; Uh - huh . ; And at some point , I 'd like to get back to , uh , porting Quicknet to the multiprocessor Linux box .
Bmr005_876	ar	Yeah . ; Is this proprietary ? ; Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? ; Uh . No . No .
Bro028_833	s	Uh , you know , it 's not supposed to be there . ; Uh and , uh , ; this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels . ; And then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something ,
Btr002_2577	ba	and it was actually written out phonetically , ; and I changed it . ; I 'm like " it 's just laughing " . ; Good .
Bro013_46	%--	But . ; So . There is one difference ; Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . ; So there is
Bed010_558	qy	Yeah . ; but um definitely it 's interesting to look at at cross the bordered there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Are are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position of of the direction relative relative to the speaker ?
Bmr007_638	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; so Once we 're done with this stuff discussing , ; right .
Bro027_1721	%	OK . ; Which is which is certainly giving a ; So you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . ; to
Bed006_165	s	Yep . ; OK . ; Wonderful . ; And um we have a little description of asking peop subjects to contact Fey for you know recruiting them for our thing
Bro019_71	aa	Sunil 's here for the summer ? ; One thing ; Sunil 's here for the summer , ; right .
Bmr030_295	s	But ; Well ; Yeah . ; So so you There 's a trade - off
Bmr016_754	b	Uh , and Don should ; And and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files ; and and do all the naming automatically , ; OK .
Bro022_1107	%--	because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion , ; so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . ; So , ; I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w
Bmr021_389	2	u I don't know if this would mess other things up , ; but It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around . ; What would be easier would be like pointers . ; The list ,
Bed011_982	%--	OK . OK . ; Nothing to write home about . ; OK . ; And um the
Bro016_945	s	multi - national taxes . ; So , I 'm I 'm starting to write code now for my work ; but I don't have any results yet . ; Um , i it would be good for me to talk to Hynek , I think , when he 's here .
Buw001_533	b	Right . ; And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? " ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro024_1779	b	and so there 's ; everywhere the well matched 's s s performance is very good for the French Telecom . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_506	aa	I mean , th that 's the kinda thing that maybe like , um , the general uh con sort of like NTL - ish like , whatever , the previous simulation based pers maybe you 're talking about the same kind of thing . A general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate . ; Yeah . ; And good to do at some point anyway . ; Yeah .
Bro022_655	s	D d ; Oh , right , right , right , right . ; Do you mean the b ? ; MFCC features
Bro022_799	b	I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . ; But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_517	%--	Uh , it did , ; there is a reference to Srini ; Well , s reference is one thing , ; the question is is there any place
Bed006_485	t1	and especially Bhaskara ; and uh and um ; Oh do I have it here ? ; No .
Bro028_699	%--	Uh - huh . ; So because what we 're doing is pretty strange and complicated , we don't really know what the effect is at the other end . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , my thought was maybe
Bmr013_400	aa	Right . ; And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing ; It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . ; Right .
Bmr016_2020	bk	eh , " so in the data column five has " , you know , " one point five compared to seventy nine point six " , ; it 's like when you see the words it 's really hard to follow the argument . ; And this is just really a a way of someone who would handle th the data in a more discourse - y way to be able to follow what 's being said . ; Oh OK .
Btr002_1712	b	And whistles . ; He was it I you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy , ; he was making these funky sounds ; Yeah .
Bed006_808	s	sorry I just don't kn ; um um um ; This is just uh XML mo notational ; but um the fact that it 's action schema and then sort of slash action schema
Bro019_149	s	Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently ; and uh , ; uh I fired off a training job , ; and then I fired off a recognition job
Bed004_860	s	I just forgot it again . ; No . ; Oh yeah , ; b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever ,
Bmr007_1033	s	Mm - hmm . ; But , eh ; I I Sorry . ; I I have found that when when I I analyzed the the speech files from the , eh mike , eh from the eh close eh microphone , eh I found zones with a a different level of energy .
Bed017_337	b	Except for humans can't really solve it either , so . ; yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro027_298	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz they have it ; Maybe I 'll send it to the list .
Bed014_711	%--	Guess it 's like I g The other thing is , whether you have a m m user model that has , you know , whatever , a current plan , whatever , plans that had been discussed , ; and ; I don't know , ; I mean
Bro026_217	%--	because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . ; And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . ; And that 's hard enough . ; I mean , I don't think we really
Bed013_72	s	So in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance . ; Hmm . ; Well , like in AI they generally do the take in , ; and then they also do the generation phase , like Nancy 's thing .
Bmr031_523	s	so . ; they 're they 're in a different situation cuz they 're doing video . ; And so compared to the video , the audio is just noise ; in terms of disk space ,
Bmr027_1239	%--	Yeah . That 's what I thought too . ; That 's a great ambiguity . ; Yeah . ; It 's one of these
Bmr028_1659	b	But it 's my ear . ; I 'm sure it 's something wrong with my head , ; It 's your hair . ; Hmm .
Buw001_1891	bk	OK . ; That 's that 's what I wanna work with , ; is is things that s the wrong material but the right da the right source . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1296	qw	or increase the probability of " enter directly " versus " going there via tourist " . ; Yeah . ; Or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . ; Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it ,
Bns003_45	cc	Yeah . ; Uh I will ; So so the first , uh uh , box , this morning . ; I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box ,
Bmr016_158	no	OK . ; How much of this do you need ? ; with uh the ; It 's actually unclear right now .
Bed012_805	s	OK . And you 're taking it out ? for now ? ; Or ? ; Well , this is D ; OK , this , I can I can get it in here .
Bsr001_960	b	I think in in ; It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know , completely informal conversational speech . ; So you don't think they they fill it at all with any , you know ; OK .
Bro024_1434	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Ah ! ; So so that means the only thing ; So so so these numbers are simply
Bed015_1546	aa	So this entire thing is inside a world , ; Right . ; not just like the top part . ; Right .
Bro027_1458	b	There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training . ; But by having them both there ; The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1298	s	Oh , ; um . Well , only one ; There 's only one Gaussian . ; I am only using only one .
Bmr013_641	s	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh , how how m much ; time so the meetings vary in length ,
Bmr016_1842	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Don and I were just noticing , ; love this one over on page three ,
Bmr031_1671	%--	Really s really hungry fish . ; It 's part of the budget . ; I 'm I 'm not kidding . ; Really . They just they they pre - stocked it with with a a
Bmr027_703	g	but I guess it 's a pain . ; Well , but you have to copy the whole file . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Bed015_502	qh	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; " what is now , ; what was past ,
Bmr009_782	t1	" forms " . ; You had something on forms . ; Forms Next iteration of forms . ; Oops .
Bro027_317	g	OK . ; For r w what test set ? ; Uh , p the one that they have reported is a NIST evaluation , Wall Street Journal . ; But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ?
Bed009_1032	s	Mmm . ; OK . ; You could do this . ; But uh from our point of view this is also a research project
Bro025_281	s	If if we can have a good VAD , well , it would be great . ; How how much latency does the , uh does our VAD add ? ; Is it significant , ; Uh , right now it 's , um , a neural net with nine frames .
Bmr021_908	bk	So w ; different feature sets ? ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1289	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and you have lots of different voices , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_156	s	N nobody reported it ? ; Yeah . ; I think everybody was focused elsewhere . ; Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample .
Bed003_1377	b	" Oh , how how much is it ? " ; and um " yeah I would like uh um to g let 's do it " and so forth . ; So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_855	s	Hey mon hafta booga . ; OK . ; So , ; that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things
Bro011_284	s	but even for the close close - miked uh cases ; um we 'd like to be able to have um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from ; So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be ; So what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques .
Bmr011_772	%--	Uh - huh . ; And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . ; So , you know , that means ; you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on
Bmr003_1886	s	Ow . ; See he said the word TCL and and that 's ; But he does such a good job of it . ; He should be allowed to to , you know , w do it .
Bmr019_1159	aa	That 's cool . ; W uh , w ; Chafe speaks about intonation units . ; Yes . Right .
Bmr009_720	g	I can give you my transcription file , ; I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , ; I don't think you need to . ; no ?
Bmr025_112	qw	Um , right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , ; Yeah . ; but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either ; So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ?
Bed010_370	x	So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint . ; OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bns002_561	bk	I mean , uh you know it depends . ; It depends mainly on on the antenna gain and the transmission power and the receiver uh threshold . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_788	aa	but ; No , by th by the moment n Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1365	s	which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts . ; u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting . ; You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said . ; So there it 's not just a right and wrong thing .
Bro025_420	s	So . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , ; so in the final weightage it 's b b better ; because the well - matched is still weighted more than ; So , @ @ I mean , you were doing a lot of changes .
Btr002_1738	s	because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot , ; and ; I don't know . ; I mean , I remember one where one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately ,
Bed002_1255	s	So we 're gonna do belief - nets this week , ; and then ; Oh , yeah . I don't know . ; n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line ,
Bsr001_1980	aa	Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro019_307	bk	OK . ; Uh , I need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here ; because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions ; OK .
Bro027_161	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , the near field 's pretty good . ; So wha what is , uh what 's causing that ? ; Well , we got a a video projector in here ,
Bro019_1453	s	and she said she 's interviewing two more people . ; So . ; And she would get back to me on Monday . ; So that 's that 's only thing I have
Bed010_139	b	Right . ; You know ? ; Now , we 're we 're not committed for our research to do any of those things . ; Yeah .
Bro021_445	s	fifteen . ; Yeah , the log energy versus C - zero . ; Well . ; Uh , that 's that 's the other thing .
Bmr016_929	s	Oh yeah th ; Yeah those are gonna be kept . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; That that 's why we need more disk space
Bmr007_581	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I could imagine that as there 's a fair number of um cases where , and this is sort of , not really hostile , but sort of competitive , where one person is finishing something and you have , like , two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to , uh grab the next turn . ; Trying to get the floor . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1039	s	Two - thirty ? ; Oh , I i Yeah , I actually Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday . ; OK , two . ; Here I 'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that I actually do have some stuff scheduled on Monday .
Bmr027_1395	s	That 's all I had . ; So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription ; automatic transcription , ; but we 're kind of running late .
Bro012_921	%--	So uh ; We ; So . ; Well . It 's just to
Bmr009_1411	ba	Yeah . ; And we 'll see what we get . ; We 're all sufficiently tired of this that we 're agreeing with you . ; Be easier on the subjects .
Bmr009_512	s	Mm - hmm . ; I I I think this is a good idea . ; OK . ; Not consider the log energy .
Bed014_1361	%--	That 's great . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; So anyone else would like uh ruin the balance of
Bmr011_136	co	Yes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth .
Bro028_889	s	whether it was some , uh , on - line thing , or whether it was a second pass , or what . ; But but they That that was sort of the idea . ; Hmm . ; So that that seemed , you know , different .
Bmr011_791	s	OK . Uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all ; but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . ; OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus . ; We spoke for an hour and a half
Bro019_1198	b	And if I don't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . ; Uh - huh . ; But Doesn't help . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_905	s	I see . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That makes sense .
Bsr001_453	b	You won't be able to segment . ; Yeah . ; You won't be able to do anything . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1695	s	They didn't quite go the whole ; It 's just user interface . ; So i it 's ; Yeah , they didn't go the whole route ,
Bmr020_467	s	if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , you know , where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really , but you know , sentences , ; Ah . ; um ; So we only looked at cases where there was a foreground speaker
Bmr007_517	%--	In in the two - person ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; He could , he could . ; Plus plus plus the
Bed006_1070	s	Right . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So . So . OK . ; So there 's like levels of granularity .
Bro018_717	aa	right ? ; The Mississippi State paper ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_921	aa	Well , so , ; yeah , ; the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish , ; Uh , yeah .
Bmr007_147	%	S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something . ; No no actually , that would be actually statistically correct , ; No , no , no . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns002_1348	qh	or maybe the less power consumption technology , without the user to worry about if he is now using this or the other technology . ; And on the other hand , what are the billing implications of this behavior ? ; Because it is clear that , well , when I 'm only uh , talking to the to the base station of my provider , well billing is more or less straightforward , ; but what happens if I 'm working uh , let 's say , uh across a mall , and at a given moment I 'm using the small base station of a cordless phone that is inside the shop I 'm at the window of ?
Bro022_313	s	Sorry ? ; Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . ; Yeah . ; But I I was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data .
Bmr003_2551	%	Uh , y yeah . ; We we need to figure out what we want . ; Great . ; Uh
Bmr009_249	s	we were just proposing that maybe it 's you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy , ; Yeah . ; um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ? ; But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots
Buw001_1720	aa	i You should ; so we might as well just do it . ; Absolutely . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_909	ba	Yeah , thank you . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Uh . Alright . So we still have a long ways to go
Bro014_1017	s	Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT
Bmr011_614	s	E ; Yeah . ; Details . ; But fifteen , not sixteen .
Buw001_76	%--	That 's good . ; OK . ; That kind of thing is good . ; It 's a
Bro010_1248	%--	Mm - hmm . ; For most for most people 's heads . ; That could help though . ; So that
Bro010_22	b	Oh , this was the , uh , talk where they were supposed to try to decide ; To to decide what to do , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1651	b	Cuz I 'm I 'm expecting , for example , with this , that you 're gonna end up , you know , picking up other peoples ' signals . ; I 've already written some notes here , ; so I ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1158	b	We o o ; It 's I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know train station London before , ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr016_1544	b	What - w what 's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non - parenthesized ? ; The parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was ANN , but wasn't entirely sure . ; So I 'd need to go back or someone needs to go back , and say , you know , yes or no , ; Ah .
Bro016_980	b	I think you are . ; They both want their cut . ; Aren't you ? ; Hmm .
Bmr008_1743	%--	The bug from last uh meeting ? ; Ah , the bug . ; The bug of was the the F - seek function in C . ; because doesn't work uh when you eh you try to to to ass n n to do an a dated access to to a file , a big file , eh eh moving the the head of the in the hard disk , eh e forward and backward a lot of time
Bro012_1241	%--	but ; Mm - hmm . ; um ; But the thing is that you can't
Bro018_127	%--	I have ; yeah . ; So uh ; So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having a separate
Bmr018_1683	b	you know , we 're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods , ; and , ; you know , the there 's arguments on both sides , ; Yep .
Bmr012_601	s	yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gonna do well on ; Oh ; Don't worry about it ; w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes .
Bro021_431	%--	I think we have a maximum of sixty , uh , features that we 're allowed . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Ma - maybe we can I mean , at least ,
Bed013_839	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . Whatever . ; No way . ; Way !
Bed005_1138	b	So one of one function that you could use as your " G function " is an e e Evidence - Combining . ; So you just take the uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table , ; and you 'd add up the total evidence for " V " , " E " , and " A " . ; Mmm .
Bro019_1171	b	Yeah . ; Make it longer . ; Uh , sixty - two point five milliseconds I think . ; OK .
Btr001_1363	s	They just have They just have it segmented . ; Yeah . ; You can tell because sometimes they have it so wrong ; and it 's like , " Well , if you had just listened to what was before " .
Bmr026_1085	s	Which I 've never figured out . ; Right . ; But I mean i ; I think it 's a bug .
Bro024_873	b	I ; That those those regions are the cause for this @ @ those negative values or whatever you get . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_122	s	So it 's , you know , not a matter of a ; Yeah . ; But , yeah , I think I think it was optimistic . ; So anyway , that 's that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might might might come out from some of this .
Bro014_1347	bk	Yeah , ; that 's ; and this is with five hundred twelve . ; Oh .
Bed016_164	bk	Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing . ; I 'm changing this . ; Just so you know . ; Yeah ,
Btr002_2515	s	I 'll put like a ; Really good point . ; Yeah . ; I 'll usually put a an exclamation point somehow .
Bmr026_897	b	OK . ; That ; Uh . They they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1436	qrr	Oh no . ; So you live in a cardboard box in the street now ; Yeah . ; or , no ?
Bed015_658	g	Well , I 'll check . ; and may maybe he 's wrong . ; Anyway , so ; I think the the " designate " that we have in terms of meaning is really the " highlight this thing with respect to everything else " . OK ?
Bmr012_881	bk	Yep . ; so it was so it 's like there 's already down ; There 's one level that 's already happening right here . ; OK .
Bmr025_216	s	Um , ; And you have to have all the o ; But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf ; and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't
Bns001_351	s	Yeah , ; non - null ; So uh ; this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of .
Bmr025_1051	aa	That sounds good . ; OK . ; Everybody ready ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_2994	s	then indicate what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized , uh , parts when there are words involved , ; Mm - hmm . ; just to set it aside , ; have some sort of a length indication ,
Bed008_507	s	and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff . ; OK . ; I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this ; and it would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something .
Btr001_950	s	Oh , Morgan . ; You guys call him Morgan . ; Yeah , yeah . ; He 's the only one who ever did that , I think .
Bdb001_1148	%--	it 's still unique and and , uh , fits with the format , ; flexible , all that . ; Um , ; it would be nice
Bro010_1236	s	uh , where they 're all distant . ; So , um , I mean , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , ; but the other thing is , uh , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , ; uh , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them ,
Bed006_1578	s	So three is sounds good ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 'll be free by then .
Bro005_813	t3	Well , the TIMIT network is still the best ; but there is also an the other difference , ; the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled . ; Hey !
Bmr005_163	aa	Mm - hmm . ; And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be ; I guess it would be the same . ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_322	aa	Oh , it was called mode , ; so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint . ; Is now this endpoint . ; Right .
Bmr003_1787	s	Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? ; Is that something you want to do , Dan ? ; No . ; But it 's something @ @ that I feel we definitely ought to do .
Bmr009_55	s	Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy ; and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things . ; Um Another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal sizes . ; He was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds
Bmr020_317	s	So ; it 's an interesting result regardless . ; Right . ; And and and then and we also d computed this both with and without backchannels ,
Bed009_573	cc	Probably close to impossible . ; Depends on who you talk to how . ; We 'll see . ; I 'll go check ,
Bro013_179	s	Mm - hmm . ; And . ; What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something uh from this , ; what 's what 's wrong uh what what is different between TI - digits and these digits
Btr001_99	s	cuz I probably don't . ; That 's not a bad strategy . ; I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage ; and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context .
Bed008_1465	bk	Oh right . ; Oh good . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro010_434	s	and then ; So so you know that that that the way that they 're ; Um . ; uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries .
Bsr001_2019	d	So at the end we 're all ; yeah . ; And the amazing thing is that even even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff . ; Big endian , little endian ?
Bmr022_943	ba	Yeah , something like tha with their cell phones , ; Yeah . ; it 'd be really great , I think , if we can argue t that ; It 's an interesting idea .
Bro016_553	s	But , I think I think that it it ; it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on Italian , uh , data and then , uh , we tested on Danish data and it did terribly , uh , that that it would look bad . ; And I think someone would notice ; and would say " Well , look . This is not generalizing . "
Bro022_1017	s	It always started in the silence state , ; but it wasn't for some utterances . ; So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially , ; and then it never estimated ,
Bmr009_1084	%--	I agree . ; If you 're i if you 're ; Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north . ; Uh yeah . That 's
Bro008_143	s	But i it it so it looks like they did some some , uh , reasonable things , ; uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . ; We did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things , ; and and , uh , and our things worked too .
Bmr002_841	%--	and then I have one more thing I need to find . ; Well . ; But that kind of thing I think we would probably want to extract automatically . ; And then I 'll be
Buw001_1293	s	Boy , I I don't know how we get at this ; That would be interesting . ; Or want to get up and leave . ; Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something
Bmr031_1498	b	Yeah . ; so I ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr030_702	b	Yeah . I think that 's it . ; Yeah . ; That was it . ; Yeah .
Bns001_868	s	Then Morgan mentioned one . ; I do not know exactly um uh what he is doing , ; but , he 's also interesting in some kind of collaboration . ; He 's also a professor in the UCB .
Bed003_47	b	It 's basically uh talks about uh It just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , ; I can read ! ; I 'm kidding . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_964	aa	Yeah . ; " Kay " , ; yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bro012_1157	%--	Isn't there some other ; S ; uh d ; So I think that it it would be good
Bsr001_1890	b	because to g to make these models robust . ; You don't wanna train on just a few people 's voices ; cuz then you 'll just learn the their prosodic patterns . ; Mmm .
Bro021_317	b	or ; Um ; Or or not constant but but , uh , varying over time in fact is another way to go . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_210	s	Yeah . ; So . Well . That 's ; Yeah . ; Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that
Bns001_153	s	Maybe I can add something . ; Claudia ; Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site . ; So , p For example , if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever , about the work you did before , what you are planning to do here , that would be fine ,
Bro022_757	s	Uh , the next thing is this this VAD problem that , ; um , ; um ; So , I 'm just talking about the the curves that I I sent I sent you
Bns002_831	b	because you you you eh have to consider the probability that o of happening this ; Nee . ; That 's really right , ; Hmm ?
Bmr013_381	bs	The word . ; Yeah . ; this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , ; So it 's like a continuum .
Bmr014_396	2	and you may already be doing this , ; but I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , ; if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis ; Misspelled .
Bro028_68	s	Was Hari on the on the phone ? ; Yeah , sure . ; OK . ; Well , it was mainly a discussion between Hari and David ,
Buw001_753	s	So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . ; Yeah . ; I I I don't disagree . ; I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .
Bro027_1014	s	So . ; n Not of the ; But n th the , um , ; tandem features are u used as they are .
Bro024_1126	t3	OK . ; Thanks . ; Please give me one . ; Ah , we need one more over here .
Bmr020_427	aa	I would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than ; Yes . ; It 's It 's ; Yes .
Bmr023_879	s	Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental ; but it you know , I I don't know it yet . ; And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , ; and then there was point eight percent ,
Bmr002_1311	b	The claim that uh words that get stressed are easier to recognize . ; I see . ; So , I mean , I I think it c there 's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input . ; Yeah .
Bed011_705	%--	but , ; Yeah . ; I mean there are hikes that you can't get to , ; but
Bed016_207	bk	Oh , man ! ; The twenty - ninth . ; Before the twenty - ninth , ; OK .
Btr002_848	s	Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff , ; Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray ,
Bed015_541	g	and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all " . ; Now we 're s now that " Watergate " we 're now talking about the real one , ; They 're real , right . ; and the " would " sort of it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ?
Bed013_143	s	I mean . ; It shur ; Unless it was in a situation . ; We 'd have to set up a situation where , it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there .
Btr001_905	b	How it was really pronounced ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr011_1530	s	but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . ; So if anyone has ideas , ; I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people ; but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing .
Bmr011_1256	s	some sort of categories ; but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things ; and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just " click , ; you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound " and so on .
Bmr028_940	s	I don't like that term . ; I have ; OK . We g we 're gonna bleep that out . ; I I have a suggestion .
Bro013_252	s	Well . ; Yeah . ; And acoustically , it 's q it 's ; I listened .
Bmr003_669	bk	And I do have ; She 's already done quite a bit . ; I have a bunch of hours , ; Oh , we have .
Bed009_122	cc	All through Friday would be fine . ; so ; OK , So ; so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about your understanding of what SmartKom plans are .
Bmr018_513	aa	I just don't know whether he did it or not . ; I 'm not sure what click what click on the ribbon ? ; Yeah , you can get that ; Yeah .
Bro021_917	t1	Well . ; Is that right ? ; Log of ; One plus N by X .
Bro004_1009	x	So I think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , ; so we can get uh key key questions answered uh before then ; Mm - hmm . ; and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace ,
Bed002_1329	%--	Can you use the sample data ? ; Is it like ; Of course they use the sample data . ; Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than
Bmr028_295	b	Um , I think I 'd h I 'd have to ask Dave . ; I did it once before ; and it was just so slow to scroll , that I gave up . ; Huh .
Bmr002_657	aa	I but but ; what uh I mean , can you spare like a minute or two of a ; Sure . Sure . Sure . ; Sure .
Bed015_531	s	Mm - hmm . ; So " in France , uh , Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon " or something like that . ; Um , well , you say , " alright , I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe " or something like that . ; The information in the sentence tells you that much
Bmr023_719	s	Yeah . ; And I think Don , um Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , ; where we can ; And he 'll be able to report on more things in the future .
Bed015_1189	s	Just means ; Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's it 's like I was thinking of type constraints
Bed003_1257	s	Is that it ? ; However these are of course then ; the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . ; So this again points to " final destination " , " doing business " , " tourist hurry " and so forth .
Bmr010_716	s	Mm - hmm . ; And then , uh ; Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course . ; And then just close enough so that you get good volume .
Bmr016_1943	s	because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? ; Yep . ; Have to think about what 's the best for for the overall purposes , ; but in any case , um , " numbers " and " NUMS " are a part of this digits task thing .
Bmr012_1004	no	It just it 's eight channels come in , ; It 's eight . ; does it have do with the sampling rate ? ; I have no idea .
Bro024_1522	s	Um . ; Yeah . ; Just you you just ta you just set it for a particular signal - to - noise ratio that you want ? ; Yeah I I made s similar investigations like Stephane did here ,
Bro028_877	qy	Even relatively short utterances . ; And they claim it it works pretty well . ; So they , uh ; Is the idea that you you run a test utterance through some histogram generation thing
Bsr001_902	s	Right . ; and ; Right . ; Yeah , so I I tried his on his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff ,
Bed006_146	bk	Majors ; OK . ; and um just sending the the little write - up that we did on to those email lists ; OK .
Bmr006_494	aa	Although it 's ; There we go . ; Oh , I like that . ; That 's right .
Bmr016_1626	aa	Oh I 'm sure we 've said XML more than five times . ; Well , then , at least now . ; S s six now , yeah . ; Now it 's at least six times , yeah .
Bmr022_800	ba	cuz I keep m you know , bending it , ; Uh - huh . ; and then it 's n and I never really know ; Yeah , see I I happen to like the old one better .
Bmr002_1014	s	You - you can access it through um through the , uh , whatever ; I can't remember which aspect of U of U Penn I was following , ; Right . ; but It must have been the LDC .
Bmr023_220	b	So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ? ; You had some thing about that ? ; Yeah . So , um , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before . ; Right .
Bmr002_759	s	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , it is European . ; Both of these are Eur - European ,
Bro017_316	s	And and and so on and so on . ; So we are learning quite a lot about that . ; Hmm . ; And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using ,
Bmr018_252	s	I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ? ; Well I I I mean , I don't know . ; That was the question . Though . ; So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .
Bmr008_529	%--	so . ; Yeah . ; I haven't seen what what they did in TIMIT . ; My Fair Lady 's
Bmr008_247	qw	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's true . ; What 's " Other " ?
Bed012_662	s	Yeah . ; And we have all the top ones , ; all the ones to which no arrows are pointing . ; What we 're missing are the these ,
Bed010_1026	cc	Right . ; Great . ; I 'll let you know . ; S I 'll send you email .
Bmr023_106	s	I guess we 'll see ; I don't know . ; i I guess it 's dependent on ; See how long we go .
Bed003_1261	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Yeah ? ; And so then we can say , " OK .
Bns001_712	s	which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM . ; So , ; I mean . Uh , I don't see that a a lot of difference . ; We can expect a lot of differences f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view . Uh , when uh UMTS be deployed .
Bmr014_1101	s	Well since you seem to feel heart uh , strongest about it , would you like to do the first pass ? ; OK . ; Uh , fair enough . ; Turn about is fair play ,
Bro018_1209	ba	uh and we see some reduction in error using some clever method , ; then , you know , will it work on a on a on a good system . ; So uh ; you know , this other one 's it was a pretty good system .
Bed015_1343	g	blah - blah - blah . ; And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning ; I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . ; So They 're more lexically marked , right ?
Bmr016_23	bk	No there 's only ten . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; so I I just have to go through them ; Well , OK .
Bro005_874	s	I see . ; French French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually ; so we asked people to listen to the um the sentence ; and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them .
Bmr002_781	s	He 's got the Mark - up Framework . ; Oh , yeah . ; Different coding schemes . ; But it doesn't have enough pictures .
Bmr029_143	s	u ; and something . ; So ; But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive .
Bmr016_592	%--	OK then , it 's already been mailed . ; yeah . ; and it 's ; Let 's see , th
Bro023_1417	b	Well , in fact , everything is sent over in buffers cuz of ; isn't it the TCP buffer some ? ; You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1575	b	and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . ; Uh , ; the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_668	s	So , we have to come up with values for this , and this , this , this , and so forth . ; And maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more . ; And , um . ; And then it 's just , uh , edges ,
Btr001_122	s	but . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Even though I still don't know what they are .
Bed003_202	aa	They 're not mutually exclusive ? ; direct navigational ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr007_224	s	S n are ; It 'd be interesting ; Yeah . ; So four four minutes all together with none none .
Btr001_1146	s	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , did you ? ; OK , OK . ; But um , that might help me just a little bit
Bmr002_1333	s	That 's what they 're using here . ; Yeah , people do different different ways , ; OK . ; a and so just as long as it 's systematic in my view , you can always filter it into some other format .
Bmr026_502	s	but ; I would like to . ; Yeah . ; Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap .
Bed004_602	s	and use that to actually get you know , detailed route planning . ; So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; But that 's not It 's not the immediate problem .
Bmr019_683	s	And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too too severe . ; So that 's actually interesting . ; The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . ; And we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower
Bro005_924	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So uh That 's ; Yeah .
Bed004_80	%--	OK . ; Uh ; Let 's get started . ; The uh
Bro028_169	%--	Maybe it 's has something to do to the fact that we don't have infinite training data ; and ; We don't ? ; Well !
Bmr003_1727	bk	and then you have the opposite direction to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus , ; um , ; sometimes we had the situation which is you know , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , ; Mmm .
Bro018_970	s	I mean there 's ; Yeah . ; You can You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so ; and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification at all .
Bro008_231	cc	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 'll be good . ; So , I 'll dis I 'll disregard these numbers .
Bed003_1787	bk	Just see what people say . ; And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with . ; Um . So this this this is a parallel track , ; OK .
Bro015_34	s	Oh yeah . ; Well , the news more specifically t for Aurora ; um ; So I guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet .
Bns001_409	s	only GSM , because the interfaces , the driver interface , does not permit me to switch between the between different technologies . ; So if I want to go to wireless LAN I have to stop my connection and put in my wireless LAN PCMCIA card , ; and then I can go on and set up the the same connection one more time . ; And what you have in mind , to do it a bit more seamlessly , and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies , in principle , were close together in that sense for application .
Bmr028_105	d	We 're talking about We 're talking about that demo . ; Yeah . Tried that , and it died . ; And it displays it at ; Yeah . Did it ?
Bmr023_911	s	And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data ; and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen ; and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop ! ; there 's this big DC offset .
Bro026_208	aa	I guess he 's busy with ; Yeah , prelims , right . ; Pre - prelim hell . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1112	s	OK . ; Alright . ; So you have w w one sheet ? ; This one is you don't need it ,
Bed012_368	2	How do we d make the decision on as to which one to listen to ? ; Yeah , so , the final d decision is the combination of these three . ; So again , it 's it 's some kind of , uh ; Bayes - net .
Bmr027_528	s	Well , our participants . ; I think the main thing is I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases . ; Sending lots of spam . ; So they s so so Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do .
Bdb001_418	%--	OK . ; But other than that , are they compatible ? ; So , but ; I mean , you could sort of
Bmr011_583	%--	and then , ; I don't know , ; save it out ; or have whoever 's interested
Bed012_327	s	has these values . ; And , um , ; Oh , I see why we can't do that . ; And , um , in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there .
Bmr022_288	b	Yep . ; So . ; You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_2010	s	I mean , you guys should probably meet . ; And maybe Barry Barry will be around . ; And ; and then uh , uh , we 'll start up again with Dave and Dave and Barry and Stephane and us on the , uh , twentieth .
Bmr019_1938	s	OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Oh , yeah . ; I the first time is traumatic ,
Bro021_434	b	Yeah . Ma - maybe we can I mean , at least , ; um , I 'll t s run some experiments to see whether once I have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matters or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_583	%--	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Um , Are you making any use ; uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . ; Does it uh
Bed014_1038	s	Three 's too late . ; Two - thirty ? ; Oh , I i Yeah , I actually Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday . ; OK , two .
Bmr009_1101	t3	No problem . ; Just rule them out . ; There 's only a few people in Idaho . ; There are hardly any subjects from " beep "
Bro018_420	no	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So he 's he 's going to ICASSP which is good . ; I I don't know if there are many people who are going to ICASSP
Bro028_1045	s	and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . ; Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that . ; And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting the the , uh the feature selection thing , ; it 's a simple method ,
Bmr009_75	bk	Neither . ; No . ; It 's uh between the pauses uh for some segment . ; Oh .
Bns002_1368	s	Maybe one last question from my side ; because I bring it up , uh concerning the proposal , some kind of active routing mechanism . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's going in a quite different direction as as as as the traditional things discussed in the ITF
Bsr001_760	bk	We don't need to n ; Mmm . ; And so we are trying to push that . ; Right .
Btr001_1697	aa	you 're about to s speak . ; which I feel is important ; Uh ; Yes ,
Bro026_388	aa	So what if you didn't So do you explicitly downsample then ? ; Do we explicitly downsample ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_698	b	There 's probably gonna be a lot of " bleeps " in this meeting . ; Yeah , I would as I would guess . ; Uh . Um . ; Yeah
Bro027_1325	b	They were doing similar enough things . ; Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . ; Yeah , ; mm - hmm .
Bmr021_620	%--	that 'd be great . ; Really enjoy that . ; With no with no advance warning . ; Y you
Bsr001_660	b	Mmm . ; Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro027_195	t1	Yeah . ; So . ; Uh , it might even be sooner . ; Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth ,
Bmr009_774	b	Do we hafta turn ; Are we supposed to keep recording here ? ; Yeah . Let 's do that later . ; Yeah .
Bro021_792	qy	Pfft . I don't know ; because ; Hhh , ; Are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation
Bmr019_980	b	Yeah . So , with under um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa ; OK . ; not for long utterances , ; OK .
Bro017_1013	aa	Yeah . ; Huh ! ; Didn't you say you got these uh HTK 's set up on the new Linux boxes ? ; That 's right .
Bed015_1785	d	He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one . ; I r I read that paper , ; Yeah . ; the hedges paper ?
Bmr030_696	s	Something about ; The demo was one of them . ; Demo and IBM , I think . ; Demo .
Bmr020_1704	bk	What can you do ? ; but what what shall we do about s things like this ? ; Well you were suggesting You suggested maybe just not sending that part of the meeting . ; Yep . Mmm .
Bro012_183	s	Well . Actually it 's better . ; It seems better when we look at the mismatched case ; but I think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem ; that uh in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters .
Bmr016_715	s	and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak ; OK . ; So do sort of what he 's already what he 's trying to do . ; Right . Except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues , um , that you can use to do that .
Bed002_453	s	So , uh ; Yeah . ; I have one more point to to Bhaskara 's question . ; Um , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling .
Bro019_873	bk	Yeah . ; It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter . ; Is the signal is is a signal substrate . ; Oh , oh , OK
Btr002_554	s	Like if that part is damaged . ; So , but , um ; Selective . ; but yeah , if I guess for most h hearers it 's just easier .
Bmr009_643	aa	Not ; You you want it around the overlapping part . ; You want it to include something that 's not in overlapping ; Yeah .
Bed015_99	s	Right ? ; So if I you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I ; I I run down the street , ; it 's typed , uh , " I " ,
Bsr001_2284	t3	Yeah , in general ; Yes , ; in the other meetings we have . ; yeah .
Bro016_664	s	Whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty - five hundred hertz , you know , might be out to thirty - seven fifty , ; you know so it 's at ; So , ; although , you frequently get less distinct higher formants , it 's still third formant 's kind of a reasonable compromise ,
Bed005_782	s	There 's this whole framework problem that I 'm feeling really uncomfortable about . ; And I haven't had a chance to think about it seriously . ; But I I want to I want to do that early , rather than late . ; And you and I will probably have to talk about this some .
Bro013_378	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping ; But they still want to just to give some um requirement for this VAD
Bro016_647	s	I mean , you can do , ; um ; Yeah . ; Fairly quickly you can do male female f male female stuff .
Bed014_370	s	Yeah . ; Cool . ; No , I know , I th I I think that is gonna be sort of the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer of of getting the constructions right ; is that people do manage to do this
Bro012_1274	s	and if it 's an independent ; So , if it 's if it 's uh not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based , ; uh looking at harmonicity or something like that , ; um if you get a probability from that information
Bro017_523	s	Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people . ; Wow . ; Where 's uh Guenter going ? ; Well Guenter is already he got the job uh already was working on it for past two years or three years
Bmr010_683	b	because , um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table . ; I mean , I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway . ; Oh . That 's true . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_80	b	and they just may ; Make sure it 's right . ; And so um , ; Yep .
Bmr001_58	s	I know , but yeah . ; It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out . ; This is at the middle of the table ; This further down the table .
Btr001_2503	s	and when he ended somebody turned to him and went , " You lose ! " ; Oh n ; And I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing . ; Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers .
Btr001_2546	s	Li ; Yeah , ; and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on , ; and he said , " Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so "
Btr002_1648	b	Yeah . And I 'm sitting there bored ; cuz I r I really have no concept of what they 're talking about . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_69	%--	Uh B Between between ; All the frames in the conversation ? ; Thanks . ; Or of things that
Bed016_1102	s	No , but this ; that 's what I have , you know , started doing . ; The castle the that old castle one is sort of ; Metonymy , polysemy .
Bro024_312	aa	right . ; OK , ; so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_755	s	I mean , how how would you ; Yeah . ; You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word ; is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words .
Btr002_2283	aa	And , uh , it 's that top - down thing again . ; Just ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Absolutely .
Bmr012_399	b	so I ; so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of of r reasonable s you know Switchboard ; this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer ; Right .
Bmr016_20	s	Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits . ; We 've gone once through the set . ; Um , so the only thing I have to do ; No there 's only ten .
Bsr001_645	bk	Mmm . ; but then using , you know , prosody information to better , you know , segment , endpoint . ; Eh , also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_196	s	Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other ; So that , yeah , I think that 's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of ICSI v ; like I don't know what I would be here , ; just I 'm not a professor
Bmr028_1764	bk	and they 're starting at four twenty , ; and I 'll set up at four fifteen . ; OK . Great . ; Good .
Bro024_426	qy	Um , so I 'm taking this qualifier exam that 's coming up in two weeks . ; And I I finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee . ; Um . ; And uh , should I should I explain , uh , more about what what I 'm proposing to do , and s and stuff ?
Bmr018_1210	s	see ya . ; Yeah . ; and if these aren't ; acoustically they seem really good ,
Bed010_729	b	Here 's the real experiment . ; The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , " where is it ? " , ; they do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_692	s	Yeah . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; And then these exponents are just applied to that
Bmr001_257	s	Yeah . ; Well , there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact , like one shouldn't even question it ; and this was one of them that was kind of funny . ; Um but I I I what I take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it
Bmr028_514	b	But I knew everybody in the NSA meetings . ; Mm - hmm . ; So th I 'm sure that we have , uh , fresh , you know , information on them . ; Right .
Bro003_1567	cc	Well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now . ; So ; Right , right . ; Well , I 'll check on that .
Bmr009_161	b	Uh , I think uh Liz has a very good point , that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show ; Yeah . ; Well , actually , you do have some distributions here , uh for these cases . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1220	fa	No , actually there 's more training data . ; This is on just digits ? ; No , no . ; Oh , sorry .
Btr002_2666	ba	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; I put " breath - laugh " in the brackets when I don't know whether it 's a breath or a laugh , ; That 's good . That 's good .
Bns001_1104	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yes ? ; Yep .
Bmr003_444	s	and I can't ans answer it . ; I don't know . ; Well we can look into it . ; No , and their web their web page didn't answer it either .
Bro018_197	qw	Um . ; Anyway . ; It 's just a thought . ; How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ?
Bmr003_1797	ba	I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't . ; So I was doing it by typ typing into a text file and trying to fit ; OK . ; It was horrible .
Bmr026_365	b	Oh . ; Cuz the SUN uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives . ; So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . ; Mmm .
Bmr024_993	s	ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable . ; You know I would think ; So for archiving , we 'll just use tape . ; One one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once .
Bmr010_314	s	Mmm , yeah . ; but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in ; Mm - hmm . ; and ultimately that path will be smoothed out .
Bed015_1626	b	So we would have it be in quotes in English . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr001_2727	s	different sized strings . ; But to have them broken up like this , it 's it 's m been about uh maybe half a year that that this or maybe maybe seven months , I don't know , maybe longer , that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line . ; Mmm . ; So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that .
Buw001_1002	s	Ugh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other .
Btr002_1760	ft	falls apart . I don't know . ; I like transcribing you ; cuz you 're very polite . ; Oh , thank you !
Bmr031_1287	b	and the also the actually the , uh , transcripts annotated with events , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_925	b	Yeah . ; the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM with these two kinds of parameters . ; And , well , it 's better with variance normalization . ; Yeah .
Bed006_692	s	Exactly . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future .
Bro014_542	s	Yeah . ; Oh . ; Oh , I I think th that would be good . ; I mean , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important ,
Bmr024_705	s	Yeah . ; It 's scenario - based , it 's it 's human - computer interface it 's really pretty different . ; It 's got a different purpose . ; But I I I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do ,
Bmr012_725	co	Great . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; and get back any bleeps that they want
Bmr001_625	b	Yeah . ; You just can't listen . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr012_1117	b	Well I mean ; Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing , ; I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the ; yeah .
Bmr003_284	s	So . ; And the other thing is that , um , University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , ; Right . ; in which case w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can give them a copy .
Btr002_1471	s	Mm - hmm . ; I have to do something visually . ; So , my I would say you have the transcript screen , ; and then you have a bar .
Btr002_2469	ba	and it 's a little confusing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; People talk about , you know , " Oh gee , that was really good , "
Bdb001_584	bk	OK . ; And in this format you would have a different tag , ; which which would , uh , be linked to the link . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1471	b	Mm - hmm . ; Zero . ; Well . ; Mmm .
Buw001_414	qy	Yeah , that that 's what I was saying . ; Yeah . ; But th there is this , um There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time ; but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? "
Bmr019_848	aa	well , Jane and I were just in terms of the tool , talking about this . ; I guess Sue had had some reactions . ; You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Btr001_535	b	Oh . ; Yeah . ; And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_291	s	Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation . ; Oh , right . ; I see what you mean . ; And that 'll be something like I it 's ver it 's interesting .
Bmr020_1215	bk	OK . ; So , ; I 'm @ @ now I 'm confused . ; OK .
Bed014_1398	s	Like " conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this " might still give us quite a few possibilities ; Yeah . ; We don't know , ; that , you know And and it certainly helps a lot .
Bmr018_1712	aa	Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again . ; Let 's do it all at once . ; We @ @ let 's try that again . ; Yes !
Bmr022_204	s	Oh , yeah . ; So that 's why Chuck was suggesting different tones . ; My original thought was , you could have a different tone for each speaker . ; You know , there 's plenty of tone space .
Bmr016_966	%--	So in principle , yeah , you could do that , ; I don't I don't think that 's really right . ; but it 's ; but it 's um
Bmr008_462	s	Well also , you you you he has a sep separate subject for Region . ; Uh - huh ; and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English . ; And then following that , a characterization of of region .
Bmr016_1971	b	OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there , ; Thank you . ; " gloss one one one dash one three zero " . ; Right .
Bro026_1061	%	I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard . ; And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . ; But , um , I don't know , I w I would I would guess that you 'd ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_531	s	I haven't seen what what they did in TIMIT . ; My Fair Lady 's ; Are you s Do they have a bunch of options like uh ; Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something .
Bmr020_698	s	Yeah ; And he and he 's ; but but but he has to ; I 'd hafta add him to Meeting Recorder , I guess ,
Bro012_1387	s	but not for phonemes . ; I see . ; Not for foreigners . ; we don't have frame frame level transcriptions .
Bro023_42	bk	Yeah , ; yeah , he 's been here before . ; I mean , he 's he 's he 's he 's ; Oh , OK .
Bro023_522	h	So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar markers for this noise estimation . ; What 's a channel zero VAD ? ; I 'm I 'm confused about that . ; Um ,
Bmr024_435	bk	No , actually , um , NIST has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a , um a time , ; Well ; Hand ones . ; OK .
Bmr010_578	%--	Yeah . ; uh Well , th lemme ask you this . ; Yeah . ; It occurs to me one of my transcribers t told me today that she 'll be finished with one meeting , um , by
Bmr012_762	s	So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms , ; And a few of the consonants . ; I mean segment them but not downsample them . ; Yeah we could we could try that and and compare
Bsr001_167	%--	Hmm . ; That 's a nice user interface , Dan . ; That 's that 's really something . ; Very
Bsr001_1996	aa	Mmm , mmm . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro023_132	s	Oh , OK . ; Is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? ; Or twelve seconds of speech ? ; Of of speech .
Bro024_1659	b	it 's it 's just the gain that 's smoothed actually ; Uh , actually I d I do all the smoothing . ; but it 's smoothed ; Ah .
Bro004_266	aa	Between the one point one case and the one point four case ? ; I 'm confused . ; It 's multilingual . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_312	b	Right . ; And that , uh ; Or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings . ; Right .
Bmr008_1029	s	Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , Mike number , Channel , Mike type . ; Why do we need that much information , ; why do we need the email address , for example ? ; Uh , in case people have the same name .
Bmr015_190	s	Um um , ; that 's the only thought I have ; because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr ; She 's trying to get at natural groupings ,
Bmr012_224	s	because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random ; so ; Oh . ; yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time ,
Bed014_888	s	Meeting regular meeting time for the summer , ; we really haven't found one . ; We did Thursdays one for a while . ; I just talked to Ami .
Bro016_983	b	Hmm . ; Hmm . Yeah . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr025_168	b	Click on them rather with a mouse . ; Ah . ; So if you typed in " small heads " or something you could ; Mmm
Bro019_133	s	Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . ; So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . ; If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , ; and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there .
Bed008_1239	s	I guess this board works fine . ; So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . ; Right ? ; So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain
Bro012_1134	%--	So . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound ; Well , it ; but ; uh
Btr002_2890	s	Yeah ! ; Yeah . ; Right . ; And so I did an analysis
Bro021_410	s	so Yep . ; But we will use the the LDA filters f derived from clean speech . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter .
Bmr015_1105	s	what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ? ; Well , but ; So you just know it 's between these other things , ; Well , OK . So now there 's there 's another another possibility
Bmr019_669	s	I can give a I was just telling this to Jane ; and and W we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring ; and um , ; some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,
Bmr002_1366	s	How many of these do you have , ; OK . ; these near mikes ? ; Five .
Bdb001_587	t1	Yeah . ; So so somewhere else you would have another thing that would be , ; um ; Let 's see , would it be a node or a link ?
Bmr020_347	%--	Uh , but mostly we added one one number , which was ; what if you uh , basically score ignoring all ; So so the the conjecture from the HLT results was that most of the added recognition error is from insertions due to background speech . ; So , we scored all the recognition results , uh , in such a way that the
Bed004_739	b	Now that we know that it 's a bus trip , ; OK ? ; we didn't We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but but now that we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1209	%--	Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach . ; So , ; uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves . ; Ho - ho how Have you
Bmr009_983	b	Yeah ; Yeah . ; So I guess my only question was if if you were a South Midland speaking region , person ? Would you know it ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_101	s	Mm - hmm . ; Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals ; and you 're gonna end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce . ; And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent .
Bmr002_1457	aa	Well , I don't mind . ; Oh , we should read some more numbers , then . ; Are we are we are we there ? ; Oh good .
Bmr010_375	b	So . Yeah . ; Yes . That 's true . ; So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_522	s	Well , see , this is the this is the issue . Subtleties . ; So . ; Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? ; The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ could 've been transcribed in the other way .
Bed006_417	s	so we uh I even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here ; you you want to know how to get someplace , ; and this is the place ; and it 's a museum
Bmr006_1132	b	And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . ; And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr015_505	s	and then , it 's , uh , you know We 'll see what happens . ; Uh , the last one was that you had there , was about naming ? ; Yep . ; It just , uh we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition .
Bmr001_357	bs	Nine . ; Excuse me , nine . ; Yeah . ; Five with wireless and four without , and four with wired .
Bed004_597	b	So that that uh ; i if you had the generalized " Go " X - schema ; and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters . ; Right .
Bmr009_1429	s	Sure , yeah ! ; Yeah . ; How do you spell it ? ; I think that 's fine .
Bmr019_1837	ba	Mmm . ; Wow . ; Oh . ; Very nice .
Bed013_1320	aa	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; you 're just being extra helpful . ; Yep .
Bro004_919	b	Right . ; And then ; But but I didn't understand ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_441	b	Um , but um For instance , I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very common overall , that when two people were talking at the same time , that it would that it really was lower , ; Yeah . ; although sometimes , as you say , it would . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1338	s	and then do some on - line normalization ; then do some more spectral subtraction ; I mean , maybe maybe you can do it layers or something ; so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something .
Bmr002_326	qrr	D I And do you have a clear I mean , is that ; Do you sort of ; Are you going to have to make up what you do ; or do you have a very clear idea of what you 're going to do ?
Bns001_836	s	Do you see this word " application " related to a network ? ; Or do you see this word independently ? ; That was never discussed in detail . ; " Network Services and Applications " .
Bmr009_1116	qw	Yeah . ; If you put eh the state ? ; Well well we sort of ; Where are you from mostly ?
Bro011_461	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . ; And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things
Bed003_1741	%--	Yeah , yeah . ; You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something . ; Although he might cause problems ; but .
Bed014_348	s	hopefully turns out to be consistent , ; so that the ; Um . ; And sometimes it 's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one
Bed016_379	bd	What you might wanna do is , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , ; and may not ,
Bro011_272	s	Delegate . ; That 's good . ; It 's good to delegate . ; I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk
Bed006_1011	bk	nuh ? ; Would they both be listed here in ; Yes . ; OK .
Bro028_475	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1298	2	yeah . ; Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to " laugh " , there 's another one ; which is " while laughing " , ; " While laughing " .
Bro022_1220	s	Well , ; I am thinking about that and working about that , ; Yeah . ; but I don't have result this week .
Bmr018_1261	s	Well , we should We shou we should work on compressing the heads , and ; I think probably it was ; Yeah . ; It probably just wasn't tight enough to the back of his head .
Bmr003_1738	%--	Oh . ; But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing
Btr002_1505	s	Oh . ; If you use that ; Mmm . ; I 've never used been able to use that
Bmr015_1156	s	That sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise . ; Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector , ; as I really try to not to detect those breaths ; which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region .
Bmr022_153	%--	If it 's individual , um y c we can probably run a forced alignment , ; where you c include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are . ; I don't think we could do it on the mixed signal , ; cuz it
Bsr001_1379	%--	there 's there 's some integration of the standards thing . ; Right . ; But I mean I u u as long as that makes sense , then it 's nice to have a variety of tasks , right ? ; To have sort of , you know , different
Bmr029_27	h	to do the training . ; To retrain ? ; Yeah . ; Uh
Bmr019_1676	s	It 's always Morgan 's fault . ; um , you know , ; Oh . ; and go back and fix them .
Bmr019_87	b	Yeah . ; I let , uh , my five - year - old have a try at the digits , ; eh . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_633	qy	But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do , ; because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector , ; which seems really unlikely to me . ; Does anyone , like , know stores
Bmr006_1608	aa	How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? ; Do you know what I 'm saying ? ; " The person who 's doing the transcript " The IBM people ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_1277	s	and to indicate , you know , in the i transcribe errors of it . ; Mmm . ; Hmm . ; And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins .
Bro012_349	s	So um , how 's it going on the ; Um . ; So . You you did some things . ; They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything .
Bmr003_2150	s	I guess . ; Uh , because the ; How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? ; Because they 're there .
Bmr003_2005	aa	therefore we can put data in it that we don't we don't have to worry about releasing " . ; But I think the point is to try and be coherent and make it a nice presentation . ; Right . ; I agree .
Bmr015_1086	s	this this side over he the we we 'll have a s ch ; Sorry , not being very fluent here . ; But , um , ; this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative .
Bro027_1774	g	because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , ; to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . ; Speech . ; But I mean , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ?
Btr002_1705	ar	Oh my . ; Oh my god ! ; Wasn't that a kick ? ; No !
Bmr012_1014	s	Yeah . ; I was just wondering if if that could change . ; but ; I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff .
Bsr001_1628	b	Mmm . ; That 's good . ; Oh , absolutely . ; Yeah .
Bro018_100	h	S ; Well , I can also th use this . ; Yeah . ; Um ,
Bmr016_2040	s	Good . ; So , I guess I 'd have one request here ; which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust , ; th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of " NUMS " where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech .
Bro028_818	s	So you you have the distributions from the training set , ; N ; and then , uh ; So this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , I guess .
Bmr005_361	qw	Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh ? n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events . ; How many overlaps were there uh in it ?
Bmr019_1709	bk	My my last meeting about meetings . ; You 're not gonna be here tomorrow ? ; Oh , that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1389	s	Oh , and we 're just chatting ? ; Just the ch the chatting . ; Yeah , we have a lot of those . ; I actually I actually think that 's useful data , um the chatting ,
Bsr001_481	b	Hmm . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1543	bk	and these might differ in that way . ; But the problem is we don't know th we don't we don't know whether the " no " is frustrated or not . ; You don't know it . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr009_1519	b	Mm - hmm . ; But you can listen to any of them . ; That 's excellent . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_606	s	one of them 's EAGLES . ; and um . And both of them have ; Oh , EAGLES . ; Yeah , that 's the European one .
Bmr027_1451	s	Did we ? ; Yeah . We did . ; OK . ; OK . So now now we have the schedule .
Bmr013_2	x	 ; So , uh ; Alright . ; Um , so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long .
Btr002_2082	bh	Mmm . ; It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks , ; Yeah . ; Oh really ?
Bmr011_930	s	I sure hope so . ; Well I th I think so . ; It 'd be really foolish to do otherwise . ; Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah .
Bmr012_527	b	Sheep . ; Sheep , ; right . ; Yeah .
Bro022_451	bk	Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; But but , ; OK .
Bed003_64	bk	Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ? ; OK . ; Because I 'm gonna switch to the JavaBayes program ; Oh ! OK .
Bmr009_1377	no	OK . ; Wait a minute . ; Where does Where does d w Where Where 's where does uh New New York west of west of uh New York City and Pennsylvania uh and uh ; Yeah , I don't know how it came from .
Bed003_1067	b	Uh , Yeah . ; It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro008_536	qw	Yeah . ; So , first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets , for some reason ? ; Second thing is , never mind the different languages , just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one , ; would it be helpful to have different ones ?
Bmr001_151	aa	Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that . ; Oh I mean , I don't know . ; Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ? ; Yeah .
Bro017_503	s	Yeah . ; Well David told me ; David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm ; and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent
Bns002_1597	s	and the involved nodes , ; and I will provide more and more information ; but um eh I have to also figure out everything from the scratch . ; I am not a total expert for for the future wireless networks .
Bmr016_1702	s	" Try to stay on topic , Adam . " ; Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . ; So now , uh , comments , you can see they 're listed again , ; same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes .
Bro016_16	%--	I won't be here Thursday and Friday . ; But my suggestion is that , uh , at least for this meeting , people should go ahead , ; uh , cuz Hynek will be here , ; and ,
Bro008_313	%	so I think it could be interesting to to see if it I don't think it 's still true when we add noise , ; and so we have I I guess the confusion ma the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise , and when it 's clean speech . ; And probably , there is much more between classes errors for noisy speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1118	s	Um ; Well , it it 's like the high mismatch of the SpeechDat - Car ; They k uh ; after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the the training set of TIMIT after clean s after you do the noise clean - up .
Bed011_670	qy	if you 're doing it for that purpose then it 's entertainment . ; Yeah . ; And we 'll also as y as you 'll s further along we 'll get into business about " Well , you 're you know this is going over a meal time , ; do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? "
Bro015_110	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro004_477	b	Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ? ; It - It was part of these results . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bed014_1065	s	OK . ; I mean , I I I ; Is some some version ; Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know .
Bmr031_1296	s	Can I borrow a piece of paper ? ; since they can ramp up much ques quicker in the language modeling ; Thank you . ; and we don you know , we 'll do the , uh , prosodic side .
Bed009_464	bk	Mm - hmm ; yeah and um it might actually ; and that 's ; OK
Btr002_757	bk	and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah .
Bmr001_601	s	Oh , it 's just not working . ; I just I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once ; OK . ; but I think yeah , that 's , uh probably it will be fine .
Bro021_542	b	So that 's that 's it . ; OK . ; Um ; Yeah .
Bmr019_176	%--	This exact same recognizer ? ; No . ; It might be interesting to do that . ; Cuz my my cuz my sense ,
Bed009_304	b	uh the the two levels will be as far as I 'm concerned as uh standing here for the generation module ; Mmm . ; and the other is is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be ; Right .
Bmr016_112	s	Yeah . ; I I 'm ; Yeah . ; don't think that 'd be that hard to read them as single digits .
Bsr001_1049	bk	More data is better . ; No , no , no . ; Um , you need a task to really , you know , improve your system for that particular environment . ; Oh .
Bmr028_510	s	Yeah . ; And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know . ; I mean ; Just we certainly have their email .
Bro025_277	%--	Mm - hmm . ; In some cases it divides the error rate by two . ; Wow . ; So it means that there are stim still
Bmr009_1533	s	I mean you would have to do something ourselves . ; Well , or use the one that crawls . ; OK . ; Well , I 'm I probably would be trying to use the whatever 's there .
Bro013_784	b	Yeah . ; So it 's it 's ; Everything 's fine . ; OK .
Bmr016_1210	aa	But but in our meetings people don't say " hey cuz how you doing ? " ; Right . Right . ; Except right there . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_910	s	Mm - hmm . ; and throw out ones that we 're not using and so forth . ; Yeah . ; And those are the ones that we 're storing .
Bro019_1183	aa	As using just the cepstrum , ; Result . ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bed011_989	b	Mm - hmm . ; mm - hmm . ; not the discourse , the utterance as it were , uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_142	s	that 's p that 's not that uncommon . ; But i it it so it looks like they did some some , uh , reasonable things , ; uh , and they 're not things that we did , precisely . ; We did unreasonable things , which because we like to try strange things ,
Bns002_1274	s	because Bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits , ; Yeah . ; eh the technologies are different , ; you know eh Bluetooth eh is using a frequency hopping system
Bmr023_1152	s	You can prove that it 's it 's a , ; uh ; If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh by training up on local local , uh local frames . ; But , um , we aren't actually doing that here ,
Bmr019_214	%	They didn't include it . ; they made them do it again . ; Whereas , I took out the ones that I noticed that were blatant that were correctable . ; Mmm .
Bmr028_1286	s	No , but that 's what the pr ; Well , that 's what I 'm saying . ; Well , you c You you s ; You can line them up based on the times .
Bmr027_337	s	but you should probably have a legal person look at this ; and make sure it 's OK . ; Because if you if you , uh , do this and you then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually exercise their their right ; Or they they might never have gotten the email ,
Bed009_305	ba	Mmm . ; and the other is is my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be ; Right . ; and I I think that fits in perfectly
Bro005_633	s	Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . ; Basically , this is a TRAP system ; kind of TRAP system , I mean , ; but where the neural network are replaced by LDA .
Bmr026_359	b	Just put them in . ; Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the ; Internal . ; Sure .
Bro004_1395	s	Well , I I don't know . ; They both ; HTK we use for um this Aurora stuff ; Um Um , I think It 's not clear yet what we 're gonna use for trainings
Bmr007_547	b	Is there a lot ? ; I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where I mean , this is called " precision timing " in conversation analysis , where they come in overlapping , but at a point where the information is mostly complete . ; So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words . ; Mmm .
Bed008_1083	s	an and it 's not clear yet . ; I mean it could be those are two separate things , ; it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as ; which would be my guess
Bro024_459	bk	Sure . ; To help out ? ; Sure . ; OK .
Bmr024_296	b	Once in a while it 's a backchannel . ; Yep . ; Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_974	b	Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , ; and the same thing for , um , well " the " . " The " versus " the " ; that there are those known variants , and ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1590	b	Yeah . ; This is a a useful thing for us . ; So . You mean they could they could do it and it would be fast enough if they do it ? ; Yeah .
Bmr020_610	%--	Yeah , we 're gonna be looking at that . ; so . ; This is purely based on you know the words ; and
Bmr013_54	s	Yeah , Yeah . ; Um , but , in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits . ; Right . ; Um , so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that .
Bed008_678	s	but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be ; Well , but ; Right . ; Well , that that 's we can't do that ,
Btr002_3301	b	i g ; that 's that 's this is just to mention an instance that happened once , ; it 's really grasping for details . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_486	aa	Now ? ; Oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_48	b	Yeah . ; OK , good . ; I liked that one . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_606	b	I don't think there 's really enough data where where ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype . ; Yeah .
Bro004_666	qy	but still the networks are very good . ; When we use the networks our number are better that uh Pratibha results . ; We improve . ; So , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or ?
Bed014_921	s	those people who who might not be around so much . ; Uh , I don't care . ; I I uh you know I have no fixed ; To tell you the truth , I 'd rath I 'd , I 'd would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day , if possible .
Bed010_685	b	I 'd love to see it if you if you have a copy kind of . ; Yeah . ; I see this is this is getting into Ami 's thing . ; Yeah .
Bed009_374	s	Definitely . ; the transition diagrams . ; Hmm . ; And it may be that that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need .
Bmr009_91	qy	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; and it 's just , you know , it it diminishes the effect of having two of them . ; But you could do like a C D F there instead ?
Bed017_662	%--	Alright , was there anything else for this ? ; One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal . ; Yeah . I 'm sure . ; I have um I think it was November two thousand three or some
Bro026_481	b	Yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff . ; Yeah . ; Well , there 's the delays and the storage , ; OK .
Bmr010_344	s	um ; who did I send that to ? ; I sent it to a list ; and I thought I sent it to the e to the local list .
Bmr018_365	s	Well , they have a choice . ; They could choose any signal to look at . ; I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed . ; But I 've I 've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't ,
Bed011_336	%--	and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences , found fifteen , twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on ; and like , " alright , well , let 's start here . " ; Um . So I haven't really gone into the , you know looked at all of the stuff that 's going on . ; So I don't really
Bmr016_538	no	and ; and a But , you know , if it were to be deflated , just the normal word , it would be like a little story that we could read . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know if it would be useful for comparison ,
Bro022_1199	b	And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , ; and the other which isn't . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1305	qw	Or ? ; It 's Baum - Welch training . ; Baum - Welch training . ; And how do you determine when to to stop iterating ?
Bns001_1491	s	The problem is which I see is that it could be fruitful to standardization ; that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers . ; But there 's not a real product like you say . ; There 's not the selling idea behind it .
Bsr001_382	s	Get a very high pitch that way too . ; And you get dogs to d cock their heads and stuff . ; Yeah it is , ; I
Bro018_1000	s	that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think . ; Mm - hmm . ; So um ; That 's a difference that I don't think we put any way to get around ,
Bmr024_548	b	Yeah . ; So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I I 'm uh , hadn't quite followed this process . ; Um . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , uh , a machi not a machine ? ; Right .
Bmr011_955	s	Right . ; In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , ; Right . ; then they 'll switch between .
Bns001_1236	bk	The application , for instance , here , that eh the interactive classroom . ; But elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Bed017_758	ar	So anyway , that was that was today 's little story . ; Hmm . ; OK . So I I did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , ; No , no .
Bmr010_1159	s	It could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something . ; Something like that . ; Maybe an elaborate one , ; cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments ,
Bmr022_95	bk	How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ? ; It was like a hundred twenty , ; and they had a hundred twenty - three or something like that . ; Alright .
Bed017_176	%--	I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . ; And so , ; I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , ; cuz otherwise you would c
Bmr009_224	s	I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature uh , looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do . ; Yeah . ; Catal - uh Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters . ; I I I I mean the the the scatter plot combining eh different n two combination .
Bed002_776	s	and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment .
Bro019_802	b	I ; I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins . ; I don't know . ; Mmm .
Bed006_1241	s	So you 'd the Source would be outside and Path is to the door or whatever , ; right ? ; Right . ; So if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category .
Bro018_936	b	but ; So maybe ; Yeah , so the idea is that the very lowest frequencies and and typically the veriest highest frequencies are kind of junk . ; Uh - huh .
Bro013_660	s	and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data . ; Hmm . ; So he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in um in this ; and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot
Bro010_201	s	Yeah , ; so they were basically ; I mean , ; they were more or less trading computation for performance
Bed011_249	s	and , you know , if we if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype , uh ; probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway . ; So , Um ; Yeah , the this was sort of these are all different sort of activities .
Buw001_1985	%	i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . ; But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? ; Hmm . ; turn off
Bro008_418	b	I don't know exactly ; because we tried we some one experiment that doesn't work . ; Um , forgot it , something I don't know exactly ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_205	b	Yeah . ; That 'd be great . ; That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later . ; Yep .
Bmr023_48	%--	or ? ; I saw her earlier . ; Uh . ; She can just walk in , I guess , or
Bro010_696	no	uh , ; Hmm . ; uh , ; but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice .
Bro026_1046	s	So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , ; but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans ; because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , ; and and it doesn't really hurt ,
Bro003_307	bk	And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training . ; Yeah . ; But if we say , " No , you have to have a different feature set for each language , " I think this is ver gonna be very bad . ; Oh .
Bmr006_101	aap	Um ; Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that ; cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , ; but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too .
Bmr024_619	%--	Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , ; Well , ; or they 're different s speakers . ; B
Bed008_1081	s	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; an and it 's not clear yet . ; I mean it could be those are two separate things ,
Bro026_664	b	and they shouldn't even care about what the score is . ; Yeah . ; But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1549	t3	I 'm working now , but eh I haven't eh results yet . ; Fifth page . ; But eh at this moment I I I prepare , I am I am preparing the the pitch eh eh tracking . pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have ; Oh , it 's seventy - five percent !
Bmr015_502	s	Anyway , yeah that 's that 's all I was gonna say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice ; and we 're sorta preceding to the next step , ; and , it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in in March in getting the proposal out , ; and then , it 's , uh , you know We 'll see what happens .
Bro019_1599	%--	Uh , we were just you know , storing ; It was We were doing , uh , stored speech , uh , quantization . ; Mm - hmm . ; But but uh , in your case
Bmr007_659	s	and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I don't know . ; To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls
Btr002_1586	s	Yeah , it 's it 's a statement of speaker style , of course , ; Mm - hmm . ; but . ; And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of ,
Btr002_2316	s	Mm - hmm . ; but the words on the page , it 's not at all clear . ; Yeah . ; And there are a couple people who do this in particular .
Bmr019_51	aa	Yep . ; Ugh . ; It 's pretty sad . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1160	%--	so even ; Those are not necessarily binary . ; S so we 're we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode . ; And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that
Bmr010_108	s	that , uh , if we had something that worked for many cases before , maybe starting from there a little bit ; Because ultimately we 're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that , ; Yeah . ; where you have some kind of simple HMM
Bro017_1031	b	That 's right . ; because then y you just write the " do " - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_930	aa	I 've been trying to get this from something like this from , you know , public cast ; uh w eh eh . ; There are there are some with a lot of overlap . ; Um uh yeah ,
Bmr020_760	d	OK . ; So we could point Mari to this also for her March O - one request ? ; Yeah . ; March O - one .
Bro022_541	b	They have speaker adaptation . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1189	aa	maybe even not . ; J Do you mean within the Source - Path - Goal actions ? ; uh ye uh uh b I uh I u I understand ; Yeah .
Bns002_130	s	higher area could be covered , could be explored ; and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing , to extend the distance , the maximum distance , than uh a single radio transmission will would allow . ; OK ? ; And in the other case , or the other area uh of of of application , is the so - called network of sensors ,
Bmr011_1474	t1	but they are no longer recording . ; But I mean , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore ; or ? ; Um , ugh , what was his name ?
Bmr001_60	g	This is at the middle of the table ; This further down the table . ; And this this one is right at the end of the table , ; OK ?
Bmr016_2299	bk	And I know exactly like what the steps will work what 's going on , in the editing process , ; Yeah . ; so . ; OK .
Bmr031_168	s	Well , not mathematically . ; That 's new . ; Now , that 's a strange ; Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well .
Bmr016_441	co	Alright , let 's try three at once you you pick one in the middle . ; The Aurora theater . ; OK . ; Go .
Bmr005_935	no	I think we could find that out . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; I 'm I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .
Bmr014_925	s	Well ; So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting . ; Right . ; And then if they don't , you 're done .
Bmr019_656	s	So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file . ; Uh - huh . ; Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments , ; but instead you have sort of feature file segments .
Bed013_577	s	It 's ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And it 's also difficult to even if you had a lot of substance , it 's hard to demonstrate that in four pages , basically .
Bed008_1331	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So step two is um
Bmr030_114	s	Switch between applications ? ; How is he gonna do it ? ; Alt Tab . ; It 's just Alt Tab .
Bed013_513	b	because it 's something we eh ; Having it is still a good thing . ; having it is a good good thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1286	%	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; But
Bed014_656	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Or ; Anyway . ; So one could well imagine ,
Bed010_661	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , reference object and Um . No , from from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair . ; Right . ; You you can actually say things like , um , " it 's behind the tree from me " or something like that , I think , in in in certain circumstances in English ,
Bed003_1152	ba	To my understanding . ; OK . ; Oh . ; That would be awesome .
Bns003_573	ar	Yes , ; yeah . ; Can you give us more details of concerning the status ? ; No ,
Bmr021_934	s	just uh to get ; Wi - without what ? Without VTL . ; Just ; Vocal tract thing ,
Btr002_1895	b	Yeah . ; and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_463	b	OK . ; I mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . ; that 's ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1710	bk	Yep . ; And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . ; So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which worry who the speaker was . ; Yep .
Bmr021_38	bk	It has one good effect , that people are trying to get there early ; because the people who get there early get to pick the mike . ; Interesting . ; OK .
Bed009_1101	b	part of it comes from the ontology . ; The tower is this kind of object . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro018_1200	aa	So um ; OK , so it 's then then it 's it 's it 's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the SRI system ; and ; Yeah ,
Bro008_407	s	Yeah . ; Uh , and , uh ; I don't know ; So , looking at the data , where , you know what 's the what 's what 's th what 's characteristic
Btr001_1298	%--	Wow , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; but I definitely saw a lot of
Bed016_950	qw	Yeah . ; A castle . ; How old is it ? ; How much does it cost ?
Bro019_415	bk	And uh , ; OK . ; so , ; oh yeah
Bro004_245	s	OK . ; And if you exclude English , from this combination , what 's that ? ; If we exclude English , um there is not much difference with the data ; with English .
Bro014_1212	b	I mean , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech , ; Yeah .
Bro012_773	s	and channel one is the distant microphone . ; And it 's perfectly synchronized , ; so . ; And the sentence contain only one word , which is " Due "
Bro004_1162	%--	Yeah , so I mean in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here . ; I t ; Mm - hmm . ; I think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like uh
Bmr015_188	s	Sure . ; Yeah . ; Um um , ; that 's the only thought I have
Bro011_604	%--	but . ; Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just um you know create uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . ; Mm - hmm . ; And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um
Btr001_428	b	right ? ; In Canada it 'd be ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro023_485	bk	Oh , yeah , fifty - seven ; point ; Right . ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_1452	bk	In other words , rather than , um , uh , saying we 're gonna listen to everything ; I didn't mean listen to everything , ; I meant , just see if they 're any good . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1196	s	where you have exact boundaries for each s utterances . ; Sometimes there are some some words are cut off ; or there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . ; And so there are more insertions
Bmr008_1439	s	and they 're already roughly ; so that each person 's hearable , ; right ? ; so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway .
Bed015_2129	s	It 's just you need an ontology of the domain ; and you need the context dependent modules . ; And if this can be made to work at all , that 'd be kind of funky . ; Um , it sounds to me like you want P R
Bed014_784	b	Huh ? ; Yeah . ; We 've been doing quite a bit of that . ; Yeah .
Bed017_440	s	and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach . ; So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? ; And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , ; and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking .
Bed013_16	s	More or less ? ; I 'll be off to Sicily and Germany for a couple , three days . ; Now what are y what are you doing there ? ; I forgot ?
Bns001_1665	s	So , I think it 's worth to to consider something in that way ; Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it , ; but eh f to me u ; what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by ,
Bmr008_1258	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But Even if we can't , generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your database blank , that this information was not collected for this meeting . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_790	bk	like , uh , like your tongue ; But it 's not completely blocking the airflow . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah ,
Bro027_705	%--	So , what you have now is fort uh , forty for the the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the LDA . ; That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel , ; right ? ; So I think ,
Bmr007_826	s	And then I median - filtered that using , um a fairly long filter length . ; Uh well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers . ; Um and that 's to average out you know , pitch , you know , the pitch contours , and things like that . ; And then , uh looked for long runs .
Bmr029_365	bk	So , you could get those going while Dave is , um , creating waveforms for the r retraining the short male models . ; Yeah . Once we know which segmentations we 're using . ; Yeah . ; Right . OK . OK .
Bmr025_834	s	just just in case we ; I mean , it 's just ; even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate ; uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do
Btr002_1670	s	Yeah . You guys do some in the mee in the Meeting Recorder ones , there 's some talk of , ; D d I don't know , ; discourse stuff . ; I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription .
Bmr022_793	bk	like we 're not using the lapel anymore , an and so forth . ; But ; the other stuff is just gonna some variability we 're gonna have to accept . ; It 's I I understand ,
Bns001_442	b	Hm ; But maybe there are also other opinions . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed002_14	ar	Sibilance . ; So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . ; Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? ; No .
Bmr003_1450	d	How are you handling backchannels ? ; Backchannels ? ; Um , ; Comments .
Bmr031_462	aa	Well , I would suspect it 's because it 's what the hardware does . ; For ; Oh , and they just don't want to downsample ? ; Yeah .
Bmr028_815	aa	I mean , if you can't use all the processors on whatever machine , we 'll help you with that . ; Yeah . That 's right . ; Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special . ; Right . Exactly .
Bmr012_619	s	so ; but but there 's other phenomena , ; it 's a meeting , ; it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes
Bed012_254	s	I 'm h I 'm happy that they 're recording that . ; That headphone . The headphone that you have to put on backwards , with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it ? ; It 's a painful , painful microphone . ; I think it 's th called " the Crown " .
Bed009_1090	%--	let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower . ; Mm - hmm . ; So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w ; if it works right ,
Bed011_456	bk	I 'm sorry , Fey , what ? ; That w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? ; That 's what I was suggesting for the first round , yeah . ; OK .
Bed008_1266	s	That 's the way belief - nets are defined , ; like each node given its parents , ; right ? ; So um that 's what we want ,
Bmr010_870	b	so ; So are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ? ; Uh is it ? ; Huh .
Bro005_1338	s	And then , you know , once we ; Um , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about ; uh , that you 'd not getting to ; and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most ,
Bmr019_750	s	I I think you can do better by uh , cloning ; so we have a reject phone . ; And you and what we wanted to try with you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , uh , t cloning that reject model ; and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground ,
Bed008_365	qy	so that the belief - net itself has properties ; and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . ; So the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , ; the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark
Bmr006_391	b	Yeah , I thought so too . ; Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that ; Free lunch is good . ; Yeah .
Bro003_814	s	right ? ; Spanish ; Oh , Spanish stories ? ; Albayzin is the name .
Bed008_378	aa	Now ; Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , ; for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um ; Right .
Bro021_633	s	um , ; you know , there might be some numerical issues . ; We don't really know that . ; The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion .
Bro007_69	b	Well . ; There 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_620	%--	Well , I don't know . ; and and instrumented rooms . ; And that 's a different project , I think . ; f u
Btr002_1200	s	Mm - hmm . ; I could easily put a PC keyboard in there if anyone had ; I we already have one , ; I could add ane another one
Bed002_1186	s	Sure . ; And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . ; Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , ; and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way .
Bed005_1291	s	which might be equal , or whatever it is . ; Yeah . ; So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology . ; And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless we find a reason to do something different .
Bro019_733	b	Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched . ; It 's it 's ; Because it ; OK ,
Bmr003_1335	bk	Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . ; I see . ; So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen . ; OK .
Btr002_3319	bk	OK . ; To fill in . I see . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bmr018_666	s	Yeah , so I was curious about that . ; cuz because what he was what I was saying when I looked at those things is it it I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; They just plain got it all right .
Bro012_267	%--	You said on the other cases you didn't notice ; But . I think , ; yeah . ; I think the reason is ,
Bmr011_890	bk	Oh . OK . ; I gotcha . ; So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . ; I see .
Bsr001_442	b	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; forget it . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_65	d	Could you take that mike there ? ; Are these the long term means ? ; Like , over the whole ; I mean , the means of what ?
Bed002_343	%--	So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . ; So , I thought , " Mmm ! ; Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . " ; Where we can start it and n sort of look
Bro014_270	d	I haven't thought it through , ; but one one would think that each It ; it 's like if you say what 's the what 's the best way to do an average , ; an arithmetic average or a geometric average ?
Bro021_915	t1	And the noise signal . ; uh So that 's log of X plus log of one plus , uh ; Well . ; Is that right ?
Bro018_626	%	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; I it can be a a reduced um parameterization of of the the model by just keeping certain selected examples . ; Hmm .
Bed015_244	b	So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , " are you of type is this part of type whatever " , um , the " designates " tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . ; OK , so if you have like " the big red ball " , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun . ; Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_661	bk	at is that right ? ; Talking to people about that ? ; I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . ; OK .
Bro011_634	x	Mm - hmm . ; So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot ; I see . ; and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own
Bed003_1638	fa	um , ; giving his job talk I think . ; um , ; Sorry .
Bed002_531	s	That 's what they say , is , " Where is it ? " . ; Where is that damn thing ? ; And the parser would output ; Well , that 's a a question mark .
Bmr012_233	s	OK . ; Alright . ; Yeah . ; but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem
Bro022_456	b	you know , unless ; Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . ; But but , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1292	s	Um , that ye overall , yes , ; but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse . ; But that 's beside the point . ; We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .
Buw001_1727	s	I need to email him , uh , my shipping address ; and you need to email them something which you already did . ; I did . ; I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL ,
Bsr001_2241	%--	cuz we didn't we haven't done any pilots , ; we haven't seen this , incredibly difficult data of overlapping . ; But this is ; uh , Christine Helverson , who 's working on this with me from the s um , aspect of user , you know , usability and stuff , would , y you know
Bmr029_619	%--	You have models of short males ? ; Yeah . ; Um Right . Uh , let 's see . The the ; You you can I mean you could you could run the ,
Bro025_46	b	Mmm . ; Well , the results are similar . ; Yeah . I mean , it 's it 's actually , uh , very similar . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1469	b	You do two iterations of that . ; Then you do two iterations of of of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures . ; And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model , ; Yeah .
Bed015_1812	s	Yeah . ; I don't know too much about the like grammatical ; I just mean ; There 's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth .
Bro004_969	b	And you have the original features . ; Which are PLP , or something . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_701	%	I know . ; And we 're we have a little problem of no women , ; Boy , that 's abs I had never I hadn't even thought about that . ; I know , it 's a disaster .
Bmr024_1512	aa	And , the result in the end was no different . ; Right . ; So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models . ; Yeah , maybe not .
Buw001_1149	no	Yeah . ; OK . ; So so that was the prosody thing . ; We - I don't remember it .
Bro017_85	co	Right . ; you know ? ; Right . ; " so let 's deal with that " .
Bmr016_1777	b	What I meant is that there should be a pronunciation " tickle " for TCL as a word . ; Oh I see . ; And that word in the in , you know , it stays in the language model wherever it was . ; Yeah .
Bro023_39	bk	Yeah , ; yeah . ; Yeah , we met him in Amsterdam . ; Yeah ,
Buw001_1409	s	Well , and and also ; Hmm . ; And " interesting " is more interesting than " important " . ; i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .
Bro012_1462	s	Oh , they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech ? ; The modern ones don't do a a simple switch . ; They just work on the code book ; and find out the best excitation .
Bed004_746	cc	and , uh , I had one more thing , ; the it needs to do ; Yeah . ; I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing ,
Bmr028_1300	b	Th - what I thought . ; Alright . ; So it does a it does a word alignment , like you have to do for scoring , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2322	2	Mm - hmm . ; And it 's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it , ; but how very complicated it is when you see the words . ; Indecipherable .
Btr001_2525	b	Yeah , like when they do random sounds that you have no idea ; Like , " Thanks ! " ; He 's very funny . ; Right .
Bmr019_888	s	Yeah . ; Just ha uh , trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that ; Mm - hmm . ; you could actually get something , um uh , uh , get an objective measure .
Bro019_1607	qw	yes . ; and Well they are much lower . ; If this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly ? ; I mean h how is the speech created ?
Bro023_1286	ba	uh , the first thing I tried to optimize is the , um , time constant of the smoothing . ; And it seems that the one that I chose for the first experiment was the optimal one , ; so uh , ; It 's amazing how often that happens .
Bed008_1541	%--	OK . ; I mean , I I I I was uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail ; and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now ; but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know
Bed004_855	t1	Because the mean the semantics are very complex in that . ; Right . ; OK , yeah ? ; I had one more thing .
Bro010_935	%--	Ouch . ; It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean
Bmr002_1342	cc	What is the plan ? ; We 're gonna ; I mean , How many How many How many meetings ? ; I 'm gonna go download " Transcriber "
Bro025_391	s	Mm - hmm . ; But if we get told otherwise then , you know , we may have to c clamp down a bit more . ; Mmm . ; So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping .
Bed014_130	no	Sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh , the German concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules ; I didn't know she spoke German .
Bmr015_154	b	Yep . ; Yep . ; Which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_780	bk	Yeah . OK . ; But um , and hopefully all sidetracking um , other things will have disappeared , soon . ; Good . ; Yep .
Bro023_1238	s	The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean ; but then you get a different noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , um , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises .
Bro023_20	b	Mm - hmm . ; and give us his his thoughts . ; And so it 'll be another another good person looking at things . ; Oh .
Bsr001_1293	s	so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do ; Uh - huh . ; but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . ; So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things .
Bmr009_1246	s	Oh , I see . ; Huh . ; Well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity . ; Yes , but if , as Liz is suggesting , people who have strong accents know that they do
Bro003_896	s	OK . ; So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not . ; Right . ; I think that 's right .
Bro019_1429	s	never mind . ; Um , yeah . ; And so , this this past week um , I 've been uh , looking a little bit into uh , TRAPS um , and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too , ; just , um , seeing seeing if that 's possible .
Btr001_763	s	and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning . ; Oh . ; And then ; you It sounded like " great "
Bro025_235	s	And , uh , there 's the second stream thing . ; And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on . ; What was the issue with the VAD ? ; Well , better ones are good .
Bro008_438	s	You just took one filter , threw it there , ; Yeah , ; right ? ; And it seems to me that , um , if that is an important idea , which , you know , might be , that one could work at it for a while , as you 're saying .
Bro011_500	s	Is it sonorant in that band ? ; Right . ; i It 's hard to even answer that ; what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant .
Bmr002_844	aa	And then I 'll be ; I mean , e this is , the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bro008_183	b	Uh , probably the day after they leave , ; but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So
Bmr008_309	aa	So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss . um , with the digits forms . ; Well I guess I was thinking maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ? ; So , s can we get ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1991	s	and the week after I won't , ; cuz I 'll be in Finland . ; And the week after that I won't . ; By that time you 'll be Uh , you 'll both be gone from here .
Bmr012_994	bk	But that 's a question because that would ; if it was possible cuz it is i ; you know already we have a a a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked ; Right .
Bed002_193	b	Yeah . ; There we go . ; By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well . ; Yep .
Bmr010_924	t3	We also tried , um , absorbing these uh , both laughter and and actually also noise , ; and , um ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bro012_302	%--	and it had it was just barely significant for the well - matched ; better . ; Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state . ; Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have
Bed017_116	aa	and why it is s somewhat related , ; and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using . ; And um . Was that enough of an update ? ; I think so .
Bro016_226	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Well , this ; the whole problem with insertions was what I think , um , we talked about when the guy from OGI came down that one time ; and
Bed014_942	s	It doesn't matter . ; I 'm basically I 'm here . ; So . ; Well , if one sort of thing is , this room is taken at after three - thirty pr pretty much every day
Bed017_398	s	which are very , very coarse grain , ; so you have some like , science , biology , and then ; But that 's really all that we have at the moment . ; So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there .
Bro014_762	g	um , ; with the short filter it 's not worse . ; So ; well , is it
Bns002_756	aa	Yeah , OK , ; maybe that 's applied for RTS CTS , ; but for the real frame ? ; Yeah ,
Btr002_1146	aa	Hmm . ; And the one close to you is Basmati . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr014_636	s	Yeah , and I and I tried t to normalize uh uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , ; because they 're , yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech . ; And it works quite well . ; But , not always .
Bed009_924	%	so it would be a full foreign lexicon . ; And that 's what you have . ; Yeah ; Yep .
Bmr011_1659	aa	I could ; Put a little ad up saying , " come here and argue " . ; Not not ; Yeah .
Bro004_475	s	Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed ; Do you remember ? ; Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ? ; It - It was part of these results .
Bmr020_1245	%--	It 's based on your se presegmentation , ; that 's the basic thing . ; and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? For for sending to to IBM ; or ?
Bmr021_281	aa	Yeah . ; You have a special phone ? ; No , we could add one . ; Oh , we could add one , yeah .
Bro003_537	s	It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , " Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? " ; uh . And that 's something you could ask , ; Mm - hmm . ; but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system ,
Bmr018_1212	%--	and if these aren't ; acoustically they seem really good , ; but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things . ; I think it 's com
Bed005_316	b	and it 's very flexible . ; I 've just tried to ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed005_319	b	Right . ; be nice . ; No , no . ; Right Yeah .
Bmr003_1098	aa	No , but I mean , they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . ; That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ? ; Well , they might they might quote it ; Yes , it is .
Bmr006_396	b	so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . ; Mm - hmm . ; No crunchy food . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2229	s	but th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens
Bro014_1294	ba	you know , ; and and and also in time . ; So ; That 's that 's really neat .
Bmr024_1443	s	I don't know , ; forty ? ; I i it 's it 's eh it 's a f training set that 's about , um , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system . ; So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter .
Bmr021_529	b	not during this meeting but s another time , ; Yeah . ; and just get a list of everything we 're gonna do . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1009	s	when Brian Kingsbury comes . ; Oh , Brian . ; You s I thought you said Ryan . ; And it 's like , " Who 's Ryan ? "
Bns003_412	bk	Yeah , but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing . ; It 's a common ; Yes , ; Uh , yes ,
Bsr001_1731	b	Right , ; so that the ; It 's something like tens of hours ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1741	s	Comment . ; Yeah . ; Comment or contextual comment . ; It 's not something you wanna replace with
Bed005_742	s	And it 's it 's quite , um , there . ; But did y I uh I think there will be great ; because the reference problem really is not trivial , even if you have such a g well - defined world . ; He knows .
Bed013_1232	s	but , " where is X " , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever , ; it is a question . ; It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X , ; and X is that location .
Bro017_1202	s	So maybe just call it " Aurora " or something that would ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then we also can send the the dis to the same address
Bns001_577	b	" This was done now . " ; Or maybe talk to them about s operations they thought of but didn't touch yet . ; Yeah , well we are close . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_385	s	for a couple reasons . ; One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . ; Mm - hmm . ; So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever .
Bmr031_788	fa	Th - that only takes a day or so . ; Anyway . ; R r ; I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well .
Bmr018_1329	s	I was thinking ; But they 're still planning to do like fake ; Scenario - based . ; they have to do something like that ,
Bed005_662	b	Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; This is this is everything that that , um , you know , um we might want to do in the next couple years . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr024_1326	s	Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set , ; It d if you if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that , ; can't you ? ; and he showed that you could get it .
Bmr031_544	s	It was it was high . ; I don't believe so . ; No . I don't think so . ; No . So I think they they have actually a very large audio data rate .
Bro008_447	b	Um , Barry 's going to be , uh , continuing working on multi - band things as well . ; We were just talking about , um , some , uh , some work that we 're interested in . ; Kind of inspired by the stuff by Larry Saul with the , uh uh , learning articulatory feature in I think , in the case of his paper with sonorance based on , uh , multi - band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning an and , uh , EM . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_313	s	but it ; um , ; So it 's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools . ; Well , it 's It 's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers ,
Bmr005_742	s	Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the ; Well , that 's ; That 's what I was gonna bring up . ; I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,
Bro003_258	x	Yeah . ; So I 'm not sure if . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out ; if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gonna be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will . ; Mmm .
Bmr015_517	s	And that 's easy enough to do . ; And I don't think we have so many meetings that that 's a big deal just to change the names . ; So that means , uh , instead of calling it " MR one " , " MR two " , you 'd call it " MRM zero zero one " , ; " MRM zero zero two " , things like that .
Bro019_1639	b	Yeah . ; I mean , that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , ; as as what you ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_64	s	One of the things that Adam said that I thought would be a good idea would be , um , if we g used different beeps . ; And so there may be ; Which makes sense . ; So for example if we alternated between two beeps , a high and a low .
Bro026_1041	b	Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier ; and and and , uh , the phones are ; uh , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of ; Mmm .
Bed009_965	2	yes , it 's it 's um possible to to do list processing . ; and Maybe this is um more adequate for English ; and in German um set processing is used . ; Set .
Bro005_1355	bk	Um ; Yeah . Right now , I 'm I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . ; Ah ! ; I see .
Bmr024_1344	s	The , uh the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling , ; uh , uh ; Um I uh I 'm actually re - optimizing them . ; Although that hasn't shown to make a big difference .
Bmr003_1762	bk	But I think for meetings it 's probably alright . ; Hmm . ; But , a lot of these issues , I think that for uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . ; Sure .
Bmr016_1255	qy	One of them is , um , the gloss type we just mentioned . ; Can ca ; Another type is , um ; So a are we done with acronyms ?
Bmr008_615	s	so the idea again was , you know , you might wanna also know if if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up ; and so uh , I think you wanna The idea the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might um ; you know , if you say your native language was was English but uh you you grew up in Germany , uh I think this ; Yeah , y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing , which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough ,
Bmr014_379	x	but I think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . ; The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . ; What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , ; that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout ,
Bed013_1225	bk	The system doesn't massage you , no . No . ; or what 's something that they ; I I I don't ; OK .
Bro015_121	s	I 'm sorry ? ; Yeah . ; I mean . Uh . Who 's who 's was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s subtraction approaches with what we had for instance . ; Sunil was working on this .
Bmr003_2331	%--	Oh , yeah ! ; I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer . ; Wow . ; Uh , let the record show at uh at f four thirty - five Adam Janin says
Bmr005_702	s	Do y do you think that would speed it up ? ; Uh , speed up your your your marking ? ; nnn , I don't understand very . ; It took you a long time to mark twelve minutes .
Bmr014_70	s	Um . ; Well , OK . ; No I 'm just ; I mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance .
Bro012_1200	s	Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise . ; Yeah ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch .
Bmr003_419	bk	OK . ; to adapt the speech recognition . ; Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_341	%--	That would be OK , too . ; I mean , I 'm i ; So , if they have a set that they worked with , ; and you you got
Bdb001_428	b	So , ; So , ; well , the other thing is if we choose to use ATLAS , which maybe we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it . ; OK .
Bmr022_833	s	I 'm just not sure what we should do . ; Yeah . ; don't they ? ; Specially .
Bed016_314	s	And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides ; but he didn't do it , ; so from but I have the paper , ; I can make a resume of that ,
Bed015_826	s	and say , " hey , that 's my focus exponent . " ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is .
Bro004_771	aa	That that 's true for the hybrid system , ; it 's true for a tandem system . ; So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_663	s	Right . ; and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . ; OK . ; Right , I mean , just it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same data .
Bed015_238	ba	Mm - hmm . ; So basically now , um , this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , ; which is that " designates " isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now . ; Good .
Bmr027_832	b	But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it . ; No , no , no . This is different . ; This is not So , I I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . ; Mmm .
Bro012_246	aa	Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ? ; Are they supposed to be point five or point six ? ; I think you 're not allowed to ; Yeah .
Bmr007_247	b	You don't know ? ; OK , you you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is ? ; mmm , Because the the uh , @ @ is @ @ . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_189	aa	Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it , ; That 's right . ; and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . ; Yeah that 's right .
Bmr007_986	b	And I think that 's a problem with this . ; Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes . ; What I 'm doing is trying to use the close - talking mike and just use Can - and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works . ; Yeah !
Bns001_492	bk	ist fertig . ; Uh . ; OK ; Oh , OK .
Bsr001_2070	b	and then you can't compare them at all , ; which is what the literature is sort of like now . ; So , um , and then there 's the issue of recognizer dictionaries , and non - standard forms , and things like that that have to be mapped . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1108	bk	I think I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy . ; Ah , OK , mm - hmm . ; Yeah , it 's this . ; yeah .
Bro026_1028	%--	Maybe . ; And so ; Right . ; If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters Uh
Bns001_796	s	That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management . ; Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets . ; It 's almost perfect . ; They s kind of skipped uh layer five , uh session management or session layer , I think .
Bmr026_1156	%--	OK . ; You gonna say something ? ; Yeah . ; I was wondering uh you know what size net I should
Bed015_703	s	Just point at Robert . ; Whenever I 'm confused just point to him . ; Right . ; You tell me .
Bmr007_275	s	Mm - hmm . ; Actually , um um actually not . ; Uh , so le let 's think about the case where A starts speaking and then B overlaps with A , and then the minute boundary happens . ; And let 's say that after that minute boundary , um B is still speaking , and A overlaps with B ,
Bmr016_1603	s	The number to the left is the number of incidences ? ; This ; Count . ; Number of times out of the entire database ,
Btr001_1301	b	but I definitely saw a lot of ; I 'm really picky . ; there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tigerfish ones . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1956	b	So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ? ; I guess ; It 's all up to when I have free time . ; Yeah .
Bro008_463	s	I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something ; sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something ; we take a very ; Uh , at one point , uh , Brian and I went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant
Bed017_622	s	Anyway . ; Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town .
Bmr023_909	s	I said " what offsets ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data ; and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen
Bmr005_220	s	But you don't have this this problem . ; I see . ; Morgan is the one who does this most . ; So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .
Bmr019_1028	b	But in addition , you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what what the answer is that this that the the answerer 's given ; H ; I tell you , I say I say " uh - huh " a lot , ; Right .
Bmr007_1108	b	R really inexpensive . ; You can you can masking tape it together , ; these are you know , pretty l large partitions . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_588	aa	Well , X Waves have some as well , ; but they 're pretty low level . ; They 're designed for um for phoneme - level ; Yeah .
Bro004_779	s	So um Uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , ; for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , ; so the qu ; the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder .
Bmr027_610	s	Yeah . ; Then they just come back . ; All my files were still here . ; Same as us .
Bmr011_460	b	They don't have the ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bns001_1121	bk	so , I 'd I rather would like to ; Yes , that 's right . ; And do you have some comments on it ; from the next this is version zero dot five right , yeah .
Bro004_1025	s	Ah ! OK . OK , we have lots of them . ; We have one . ; OK , so um , Something I asked ; So they 're they 're doing the the VAD
Bed006_1314	%--	Um and I agree that you know this is something we need to discuss , ; I in fact what you could say is for Enter , ; yeah . ; you could say " here , list all the kinds of schemas that on the category that
Bro027_1470	b	right . ; We don't really know what 's gonna work best . ; But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . ; Right .
Bed014_770	bk	Yeah , he said he 's gonna f finish his thesis by then . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; I should try to finish it by then . Yeah .
Bmr001_66	ba	I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies . ; Yes , it 'll be pretty horrible . ; Yeah , OK . ; Very exciting .
Bmr008_1781	b	I don't know ; but eh I I solved the problem with eh a similar way and I haven't problem ; Yeah , Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1008	bk	OK . ; So . ; So , I guess , ; yeah ,
Bro003_1569	s	Right , right . ; Well , I 'll check on that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on ,
Bed006_1817	b	OK , so Friday , ; whoever wants and comes , and can . ; OK . ; OK .
Bns002_664	s	The main idea for for our work , is well , if we are using this reservation mechanism , we are reserving an area of space for a single transmission . ; Uh , if this area is bigger than what is really needed , we are , somehow , wasting a little bit of space . ; So , uh ; our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values ,
Btr002_2075	ba	Yeah . ; and I would transcribe them in my head ! ; Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh yeah . ; Oh , man .
Bmr018_1090	ba	Yeah , I 'm doing that for AVIOS . ; but . ; Yeah . ; But I think we 're oh , Morgan 's talk went very well , I think .
Bmr011_290	s	um , i i it wou ; You know , OK . ; So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room ; and how it how the recordings are done ,
Btr002_3001	fa	Mm - hmm . ; they do this thing . ; I shouldn't do that so often . ; I 'm sorry about that .
Bed013_1050	s	And um . ; But , OK , nevertheless . So these are issues ; but we what we actually decided last week , is to , and this is , again , for your benefit is to um , pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as " where is the Powder - Tower " , ; or " where is the zoo " ,
Bro026_275	s	There 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for V A ; So , I mean , in ; I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . ; There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise .
Bmr003_1309	s	Um , the user interface only allows two . ; Hmm . ; And so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . ; But my script can handle any .
Bmr010_1055	b	One for each participant . ; So they could by hand ; Well , that 's one way to do it . ; Yeah .
Btr002_856	s	Mmm . ; And that I would it would crack a lot . ; Yeah . Ooh ! ; It was very weird .
Bmr018_107	ba	I don't know how s how early you wanted to ; They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so . ; Oh , OK . ; That 's good .
Bmr006_609	s	And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . ; So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . ; So I moved that , and then um , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . ; before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet .
Bed002_1230	qw	So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah , unt until we know more . ; And what 's the relation to this with Changing the table so that the system works in English ?
Bns003_741	%--	I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Because well , you you can , eh , fo redirect you know , the the work as uh let 's say as a subject work of something that you can you can try to , eh , s
Bro018_1181	b	It 's trained on a lot of different things . ; Um . ; It 's trained on uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home , ; Uh - huh .
Buw001_4	bk	Hmm . ; I think Well , this should be off the record , ; but I think ; Uh , OK .
Bro012_386	bs	OK . ; So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this .
Bro015_147	s	I uh , I g so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it , and upgrade it ? ; No . ; Well , I I sent mails to start the the process and I guess we should have to ; Well , we know most what we have to to put in in this .
Bmr028_1182	%--	Well , we we have a frozen we do all our experiments with a frozen version of the transcripts as of , I don't know ; As of February ? ; A a as of ; no , a little
Btr001_1513	ba	That 's amazing . ; Is l ; Yeah . ; It sounds so hard .
Btr002_3361	s	do a listing of them , ; Mmm . ; and then anything ; Some of them already have tags from some previous , uh , modification ,
Bro005_603	bk	because , you know , maybe it should be a different number for for each kind of test set , or something , ; Mm - hmm . ; but ; OK .
Bed006_752	%--	and w and on on ; What did you think he was doing ? ; OK , sorry . ; I just
Bmr018_1214	s	but if they 're not comfortable , we have the same problems we have with these stupid things . ; I think it 's com ; This is the first time I 've worn this , ; I find it very comfortable .
Bmr016_509	qw	Not after I " eight " though . ; Uh , they don't all work as well , do they ? ; Hmm . ; What does nine work in ?
Btr001_667	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; you know . ; In the prev
Bmr018_358	s	Yeah . ; So I don't ; But ; I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do .
Bed014_1062	%	Yeah . I ; OK . ; Alright . ; OK .
Bro028_642	s	Yeah . It does . ; But , ; anyway . ; Yeah . I 'm I 'm wondering about that
Bmr020_1233	s	OK ? ; Instead of doing that , which was our original plan , the tra They focus on the dominant speaker ; Mm - hmm . ; They just do that on the main channels .
Bro017_1063	%--	It 's it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ? ; Yeah , I know , ; right . ; So if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard
Btr001_1627	ba	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever .
Bmr003_1020	aa	Of of tape ? ; Or of action ? ; Thirty ; So , yeah .
Bmr027_483	aa	so that we can find a ; Yeah . ; Let me look at this again . ; Right .
Bdb001_462	b	So ; end equals some other node ID " , ; and then " type " would be " utterance " . ; Hmm .
Bro016_129	aa	and you can supervise or something . ; But ; but I think it would be it 'd be good to know that . ; OK .
Bro012_1494	s	So . I thought " well I 'm gonna just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data . " ; Right . ; And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data . ; So it 's either one , four , five , six ,
Bed012_894	b	Well , yeah , but I mean , the uh , I mean , that 's what the construction parser would do . ; Uh , I mean , if you said something completely arbitrary , it would f find the closest construction , ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bns003_411	bk	And if it 's ; Yeah , but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing . ; It 's a common ; Yes ,
Bmr009_1244	b	So . I was suggesting not having the options , ; just having them ; Oh , I see . ; Huh .
Bns002_970	s	uh , it is always some however , ; uh by applying this uh greedy mechanism , in in ; or , more than greedy in this case , ; it could be , say , this stingy mechanism to trying to avoid to use any extra space is also leading to a higher level of interference at the receivers .
Bmr003_1072	b	So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription . ; Right . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro003_1407	s	Hmm . ; I don't know what . ; I ask e even I ask to Dan Ellis what I can do that , ; and h they he say me that h he does doesn't any any s any form to to do that .
Bed015_447	%--	Um ; OK , so that 's great . ; Construal , ; OK , so
Bmr019_371	s	Other way . ; Liz ; Now you 're all watching me . ; It f it clips over your ears .
Bro003_409	s	you know ? ; So , ; uh , an and they aren't you know , with the exception of Finnish , which I guess it 's pretty different from most most things . ; uh , it 's it 's , uh most of them are like at least some of the others .
Bro008_495	s	Uh ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; No , I I think there 's lots of lots of good things to do with this .
Bmr018_232	aa	and then it 's IBM . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr014_657	s	And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , ; a single password . ; Each person will have a single password , user name and password . ; And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it .
Bmr021_782	bk	For the adaptation ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , y we always do three EM iterations to ; OK .
Bed015_327	b	because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? ; So you wanna , you know you sort of have this problem like " OK , well , I 'll put the word " , uh , let 's say , the word " dog " , ; you know . And that has to come right after the verb ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_418	ar	so that would OK ; I came out at the gig an hour , at one point . ; That that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit . ; Well I think it 's I think it 's two gig an hour .
Bmr003_2433	s	Well Apple has their own thing , right ? ; He 's ; I 'm sorry ? ; Airport .
Bsr001_1598	b	And so it just be you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with . ; OK . ; We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with . ; Yeah .
Bro005_104	s	Mm - hmm . ; And training the net on French only ; and Spanish only ; and testing on , uh TI - digits .
Bro003_474	x	and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language . ; Right . ; I see . ; Right .
Bed006_1697	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and then that 's just one way to describe the the action part of it . ; Yeah .
Bro028_979	qw	And so he he actually does an optimization procedure to choose an an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones . ; Hmm . ; H ; What does he do to choose those ?
Bmr012_833	s	Well we could try . ; There 's there 's your answer . ; But but it wouldn't hurt to try , ; Could easily try
Bro013_423	x	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Sure .
Bmr021_397	2	This is ; Right , the the only reason we do this is because the the SRI front - end doesn't have a way to to um go into a l a longer file with indices . ; Um , so I I suppose someone could try to put a hack like that into the ; And segment on the fly .
Bro024_1716	b	So you could you could base it on your estimation of the signal - to - noise ratio on your actual ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr016_155	b	and then go back to digits for awhile , ; or um . ; Do yo I mean , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ? ; OK .
Bro024_276	s	Well , I think what I was s I thought what I was saying was that , um , at any given point you are gonna start off with what you had from before . ; Oh . ; From ; and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances
Bmr006_339	aa	you know , each person who 's interested in I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . ; Right . ; And So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . ; Not enough for others , right .
Bed015_2169	ba	Mm - hmm , yeah . ; And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . ; Uh ; Tricky .
Bmr007_195	s	but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , um now , uh don't . ; I mean they they also you know , uh uh , ack acknowledge the influence of sub of subcultural norms and cross - cultural norms and things . ; So , um Then it beco though so just just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . ; So , uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now
Btr001_109	b	Some of them just occurred over and over the again , ; so like PDA . Like that got got easy . ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_122	s	That element or object , I would say . ; Not a C Struct . That 's not what I was trying to k ; Yeah . ; though yeah .
Bmr012_1390	s	I 'll be I 'll be working on this . ; And are you staying at Berkeley ; or is are you just here a semester ? ; This is my second semester and last .
Bmr024_1362	s	Was just looking through the log files , ; and ; You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization . ; And so these log probabilities , they aren't directly comparable
Bed014_294	bk	Right . ; Anyway . ; So But anyway , ; yeah .
Bsr001_863	%--	Oh , OK . ; Switchboard and , uh ; I I ; We
Bsr001_1312	b	They don't say , you know , " I 'm done , Computer " . ; They only mark the beginnings . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro027_1004	b	Um . ; since things are things are different . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_646	b	And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , ; so , you know , we have a couple weeks . ; Uh , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . ; OK .
Bed005_462	%--	It 's mystery functions . ; Well , they 're defined somewhere , presumably . ; Well , sometimes it m Sometimes , i ; Yeah , each is
Bro003_365	s	And they may very well be right , ; but I I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . ; If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much . ; Maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest doesn't matter .
Bro007_547	bd	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 'm not sure these are great ideas .
Bed011_109	b	Very sketchy , simplified map . ; And they can take notes on that map . ; And then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything . ; OK .
Bmr015_809	s	Um , I mean cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying ; Uh - huh . ; wha what are you doing this for ? ; You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker
Bmr003_2151	bk	Uh , because the ; How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ? ; Because they 're there . ; Well , OK ,
Bro026_428	d	You know ? ; I would think . ; Well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the uh , the frame . ; If you do or don't normalize ?
Bmr028_579	s	Hmm . ; So . ; That 's pretty good , I think . ; Right . So the the trade - off is you get longer utterances , but you miss fewer utterances .
Btr002_3357	s	where it 's potentially ambiguous between those two categories . ; Cuz otherwise , what I do when I get these , is ; and of course I do my checks , ; and then I have a , um a script that I wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets ,
Bmr023_1196	aa	but actually Stephane did it ; and and and it helped a lot . ; Uh - huh . And i does it help ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2076	ar	You know , and someone else said , " Well , maybe you could just turn the light out . " ; There you go . ; That 'd be kinda creepy . ; But then , someone else said no ,
Bro012_474	bc	Uh - huh . ; So that 's six six point th ; Uh . ; Ninety - three point six four ,
Btr001_2757	s	Yeah , I don't care . ; I mean , ; what we could do is we could do it together one week ; Whatever .
Bro004_935	bk	if we have twenty - seven classes , ; I see . ; yeah . ; I see , OK .
Bmr029_641	%--	Right . ; OK . So I guess I just need to get Don to , uh ; Right . So , somehow the ; Assuming he uses the new naming scheme , then he should call the waveforms
Bro023_464	s	uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it ; but the second time , what I did was I estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , uh , smoothing in the frequency to to reduce the variance ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering
Bro004_991	b	So there 's a question of whether you would ; Two e @ @ it 's one . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Buw001_786	b	So ; Mm - hmm . ; They have a pretty crude set - up . ; Yeah .
Bed006_817	bk	Is that ; No , no , no . ; Source is just not spelled out here . ; Oh , OK , OK .
Bro027_246	bk	I , um uh , started working on the uh Mississippi State recognizer . ; Oh , ; So , I got in touch with Joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . ; OK .
Bro008_96	bk	But , um , for the development set , our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent . ; And the best result of any system was about fifty - four , ; where these numbers are the , uh , relative , uh , reduction in , uh , word error rate . ; Oh ,
Btr002_266	s	I ; You know , it 's but the next one is like not not connected to " that would be a problem " . ; It 's like , " So . " ; It 's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about .
Bmr021_611	s	I assume you 're not gonna go , like , into , you know , my directories and change my file names . ; Right . ; So . ; I Actually I was gonna do a global search - replace on all entries at at ICSI
Bmr005_301	x	And I don't I don't remember which which part . ; It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK . ; Uh , I think ; Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .
Bmr001_98	bk	Right ? ; And so you have to be sure to pause between each line , since we 're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way . ; Oh . ; Right .
Bed013_197	%--	Mmm . ; Yeah . So what we actually then need to do is is write a little script that changes all the settings , ; you know , go goes through all the permutations , ; which is we did a
Bmr002_1102	aa	Well , I mean , they 're coming in April . ; April . ; OK . ; Right .
Bns003_1017	b	But he showed up the next day ; Several days . ; but only for administration stuff , ; Yeah .
Bro023_398	s	Eighteen point five . ; Five . ; And what were you just describing ? ; Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the , uh , Wiener filter plugged into it .
Bmr020_1139	s	which is the second stage is um , w what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . ; I discussed this with you too . ; Um , the tr ; so the idea initially was , we would get uh , for the new meetings ,
Bmr002_1027	s	Well there 's They have a special project , as I 'm remembering , ; and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse , ; Mm - hmm . ; but they uh they show up in resources .
Bed004_752	bk	there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do ; and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together . ; So maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part , ; Oh , OK .
Bed005_683	s	I think I think the i the idea is that ; OK . ; Oh . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal , ; but I think we don't need to get beyond it @ @ tourists in Heidelberg .
Bed009_581	bk	and not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner . ; So if there is resistance against changing it , that 's just because " Oh , We don't want to change things . " ; That that not deep reason ; OK ,
Bmr003_559	%--	And so Jane is doing primary stress , um , stress marks as well . ; Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do . ; I did include a glo uh , a certain first pass . ; My my view on it was when you have a repair then , uh it seems
Bmr020_808	bk	Just to check which w if there is a significant difference . ; And so I ; but ; OK
Bmr005_1487	ba	That 's a good way to end a meeting . ; OK , leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time . ; Oh . ; That 's good to know .
Bro014_176	h	So at at the middle o where the arrows are showing , that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state , ; Uh - huh . ; or ? ; Uh ,
Bmr027_951	s	So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . ; Everything seemed fine . ; Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . ; And then , um , we , uh I sent him a pointer to three more .
Bed003_1764	g	I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net will af affect ; Like we wanna we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , ; Mmm - yea - some . ; right ?
Bmr010_1384	s	N n ; I think Javier 's might be able to . ; So . ; It doesn't have the same Gaus - uh , H M M modeling ,
Bed003_568	s	I mean We can do a demo in the sense that we can um , just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . ; I was just gonna s ; Observe nodes . ; So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes
Bmr003_2109	s	I 'm I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down . ; No . ; And leave them loose ? ; That looks like a semi - circle .
Bed003_268	s	The probability whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter . ; Um The " context " , we simplified . ; Basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . ; " Verb used " is actually personally amusing
Bro022_870	s	And , um , ; just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , ; some sort of slope . ; And and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic
Bmr020_650	s	Right . ; It 's a very ; Oh ! ; So , exactly what you describe ,
Bsr001_1239	b	this is the same same company that may be doing the transcripts for us , ; The same it might be the same company or it might be a different company . ; may be giving us ; Right .
Bed005_608	s	OK ? ; And get our best idea of what we should add . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then go back to them .
Bmr002_614	%--	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Got a surprise . ; And um and they have you know , a lot of
Bmr003_1851	bk	The r ; Hey , what about me ? ; w What ; OK .
Bed004_269	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . ; And and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .
Bro023_1283	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , then I started to optimize the different parameters . ; And , ; uh , the first thing I tried to optimize is the , um , time constant of the smoothing .
Bmr028_1197	aa	OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell . ; But they are channelized ones , though ? ; No , no . ; Yeah . O obviously . Yeah .
Bro004_140	%--	It has three languages . ; That 's including the w the the ; This includes ; the one that it 's
Bed017_179	%--	cuz otherwise you would c ; well , it 's probably the same . ; But um , ; No , you would definitely have
Bed009_1102	s	The tower is this kind of object . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , OK . ; Part of it comes from the user model .
Bmr002_417	no	Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow and change it w ; I haven't used them . ; Does it lose the memory once you 've unpowered it ? ; I don't know .
Bro024_507	b	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; If you have clean training , you get also a fifty percent improvement . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2700	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Ex - exactly . Exactly .
Bmr018_600	b	so ; There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot . ; there were t there was there was one h one bump at ze around zero , which were the native speakers , ; Yeah .
Bro008_330	%--	No . ; I mean , if you have ten digits for a phone number I mean , every now and then you 'll get it right . ; Sure . ; I mean , it 's it 's , uh , um
Bmr007_1318	%--	If it works well enough . ; Right now it 's not . Not quite to the point where it works . ; OK . ; But I I just worked off of my
Bns002_227	s	and I 'm trying to uh show the area , the covered area , for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle . ; OK ? ; So , uh , any transmission has a maximum transmission range , ; and uh in the simpler way , we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius .
Bro028_872	s	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . And they do they said that they could do it for the test ; So you don't have to change the training . ; You just do a measurement over the training .
Bed010_263	s	Yeah . ; OK , ; right . ; And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff .
Bed005_1276	s	OK . ; Uh , or , link to ; or ; but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology .
Bro012_696	bd	But not of reverberation . ; Yeah . ; A boom . ; Well that that that 's OK .
Bmr018_710	bk	Right , but that 's I mean , that was our plan , ; Yeah , right . ; but it 's clear from Dan that this is not something you can do in a short amount of time . ; Oh , the short amount of time thing , right .
Bmr014_678	%--	um , " you need a password " . ; So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , ; and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it . ; That 's
Bmr010_956	b	one thing that c that we 're not doing , of course , is we 're not claiming to , uh , get be getting a representation of mankind ; in these recordings . We have this very , very tiny sample of of ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1411	no	Mm - hmm . ; So I mean , tho those are things we could do ; but ; I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing .
Bro014_682	s	and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this . ; So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization , ; so which is similar to the pro proposal - one , but with spectral subtraction in addition , ; and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further when you have spectral subtraction .
Bro005_1238	s	Mmm . ; And it 's ; uh ; We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that .
Bmr025_55	b	is already at IBM . ; but the other ones ; That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1339	s	Um , having gone through this process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about ; uh , that you 'd not getting to ; and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , ; you know , got you most interested
Bmr005_1369	s	What if ; Yeah , you we can't complain . ; right ? ; But they But at any rate , they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out , they 're they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they who 's who is doing it ,
Bed011_378	aa	This means audio , but ; Huh ? ; no transcriptions of course , ; No , we won't have the transcriptions ,
Bro023_718	bk	VA Yeah , VAD . ; w Yeah . ; So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . ; Ah ,
Bmr005_69	s	I think there 's just just a couple a couple people primarily ; um but um ; Uh , wh why don't ; Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly
Bed006_1588	%--	I mean . ; Yeah , and I don't need to be here particularly deeply . ; Often , ; no , but uh ,
Bed005_333	aa	Alright . ; And the next thing I would like to be able to do , and it seems like this would not be too difficult either , is to say , " OK let 's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the the mapping of of , uh , words to the M - three - L but we also wanted to change add a new sentence type ; and and make up some some new M - three - L s " ; Yep .
Bro024_950	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; These are log energy computed from the time s domain signal , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_749	s	Wow . ; You know . ; So it 's ; We 're we 're doing better .
Bmr007_636	b	right ? ; Right , I mean Adam was ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1397	s	you know , don don't worry . ; and um and and I th I hope ; um uh ; let 's make a a a a sharper claim .
Bro025_481	bk	I see . ; And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bmr013_833	%--	Yeah . ; OK . ; Alright . ; We funded the experiment with , uh
Bro028_179	%	Yeah . Uh , there was a p problem that we observed , um , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_975	s	so ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; it would be easy .
Bro017_200	s	right ? ; Right . ; Because you already uh had the noise uh in a ; And it was working at the time .
Bed003_890	aa	Hmm . ; OK . ; It should , um , inhibit that , ; Right .
Bmr021_706	s	and and you know , this is the j joint work with Chuck , ; and uh , um . ; So , first , uh , you know , we had we figured out sometime last week how to um ; and and Chuck wrote this really nice little script Perl script that takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c so - called uh cepstra file ,
Bro017_567	b	If you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ? ; Yeah . ; I don't know exactly if it 's ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_1049	s	with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . Eh for the difference zone ; Features . ; Yeah . ; you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model
Bed006_1558	s	What was it ? ; You have class until two , ; right ? ; so if we don't want him if we don't want him to run over here
Bed009_307	b	Right . ; and I I think that fits in perfectly ; So well , let me Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation . ; Hmm .
Bmr011_1402	s	Um , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , ; It 's not that hard . ; disfluency tagging , ; um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling .
Buw001_202	s	Yeah . ; OK . Good . ; That that 's right . ; There were others of course .
Bmr027_639	b	Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , ; " Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that " . ; Respond to the email . Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_717	aa	Yeah . ; I think that 's I think that 's exactly right . ; There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_309	ba	Mm - hmm . ; You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . ; Yeah . ; I think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know .
Bro005_1182	b	Yeah . ; I I just sort of have a feeling ; But Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1193	%--	isn't it ? ; But then the mike has to h ; Do you have to hand it around ; and if you have two pieces of
Bro004_1387	s	Is that about right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Because , um I think that 'll be running Linux ,
Bmr020_1763	aa	but they 'll just mark it as being there 's some background stuff there , ; But that 's gonna be all over the place . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_1710	s	Is one of you ; jump in . ; Reference . ; I haven't done it yet .
Bed013_300	aa	I 've tried about five times so far , where I work for a while and then I 'm like , I 'm hungry . ; So I go home , and then I think ; I 'm not going back . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_280	s	Maybe we should say in ; w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the the agreement that ; you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how how they will be contacted ; and they can , you know they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both .
Bed010_1070	s	No . ; Nnn . ; This Well , I 've I have projects , but then the my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . ; And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .
Bro019_600	no	You can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it doesn't change anything . ; Uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction . ; But , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , ; and we don't know where exactly
Bns001_982	s	Now , WAP is ja not only related now to available bandwidth . ; That 's the impression I get . ; That 's not the only thing . ; It 's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device .
Bed010_543	s	And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions . ; Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , ; so how how , ; I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .
Bmr008_913	cc	Sounds good . ; It 's very efficient . ; OK . So . ; Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff .
Bed004_113	s	Wait , can I I have a question . ; So . So there 's no system , ; right ? ; Like , there was a wizard for both uh both parts ,
Bro019_973	s	From C . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried .
Bmr015_618	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And for purposes of of , uh , things like ; well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing .
Bro025_228	b	Uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe ; but , uh , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts , ; so we have to be a little conscious of that . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_492	b	and we considered it interrupt if it occurred in the middle of a word , ; we basically you know , considered that to be a interrupt as if it were at at the beginning of the word . ; So that , if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted word . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_331	s	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through . ; But i but it 's very quick ,
Bmr002_487	s	cuz right now we have almost no money . ; Yeah , ; OK . ; So so the cheaper we can do it , the better .
Bmr001_612	b	Yeah . ; But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet . ; And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_1149	%--	Yeah . ; Well we could just hand around the lapel . ; Uh no ; Rather than get a
Bro023_1483	%--	Which ; But this is ten frames plus plus ; Channel zero dropping . ; channel
Bmr028_1066	b	But Anyway , I I 'd it 'd be neat to have that , ; because you know we 've been at this for a little while ; and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_523	s	Yeah . ; what 's it a sheep or a goat ? ; A sheep . ; Baah .
Bro010_1100	%--	so that 's ; yeah , ; that 's , you know , a neat neat thing ; and
Bmr006_1808	s	Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . ; and so , uh , ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; I think we have to think about w @ @ how . I think that this can't be decided today .
Btr001_2541	s	and he says , " Well , I could explain this to you . ; I have a better laugh than you do . ; The transcribers told me so . " ; And it went on a little longer
Bmr011_615	b	Yeah . ; Details . ; But fifteen , not sixteen . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_103	b	Oh , OK . ; Cuz there is another Andreas around , ; Eh ; Hmm .
Bmr003_1354	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; so ; but a apart from that .
Bro005_980	s	So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network ,
Bro012_505	s	Uh , ; do you know what pie ; Yeah . ; I guess I guess it 's it 's the filter .
Bed003_515	b	And that would require s updating the probability distribution for " mode " as well . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_902	b	Mm - hmm . ; that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1071	b	uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . ; I almost listed " discourse status " as a slot where you could say it 's active . ; You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1459	bk	I don't know . ; Really ? ; Not second by second , ; but little bit by bit , yeah .
Bed015_1795	s	Ask me about it later ; I 'll tell you how . ; When we 're not on tape . ; I 'd love to know .
Bmr028_1054	s	not which s you know , side , ; but ; Well , humans are really good at that ; transfer function through the head , and things like that .
Bmr015_260	ba	so you might just wanna mail to Mari ; No no , th I got I got , uh , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on , ; and ; OK , good .
Bmr022_289	b	So . ; You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr001_624	ba	Like if you had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know why that would be true , ; That 's interesting .
Bro016_98	%--	You say you you have for the noisy ; How about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions ? ; Have you ? ; When you adjusted those numbers for mel cepstrum , did it ?
Bed002_1148	b	u u y um ; the ; What I What sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on on on on input ; Yeah .
Bed012_671	s	And then it 's just , uh , edges , ; many of ; edges . ; And , um , we won't meet next Monday .
Bdb001_173	s	But if you have ; you know , barring memory limitations , or uh I w I mean this is still the m ; It 's parsing limitations . ; I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for .
Bmr008_1111	b	And that was my other question , which is um what sort of information do we want to record ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_938	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the in the pattern matcher or not ? ; um Not yet but it 's planned to do that . ; OK .
Bro016_550	%--	right ? ; to build models on the data ? ; No . ; But , I think I think that it it
Bed012_516	s	Or know There needs to be some knowledge that ; We Yeah , but , the Bayes - net that would merge ; I just realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er , my and my microphone . ; So then , the Bayes - net that would merge there , that would make the decision between Go - there , Info - on , and Location , would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted ,
Bmr018_723	s	so he thought well if we can do something quick and dirty because Dan said the cross - cancellation , it 's not straight - forward . ; If it were straight - forward then we would try it , ; but ; so , it 's sort of good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time ,
Bdb001_39	%--	cuz I really appreciate people coming , ; and the main thing that I was gonna ask people to help with today is to give input on what kinds of database format we should use in starting to link up things like word transcripts and annotations of word transcripts , ; so anything that transcribers or discourse coders or whatever put in the signal , with time - marks for , like , words and phone boundaries and all the stuff we get out of the forced alignments and the recognizer . ; So , we have this , um
Bmr003_1063	2	Because they had because they only had two speakers , right ? ; I mean , the the segmentation problem is ; Only had two . ; Trivial .
Bmr024_415	d	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So there was some Uh In in Adam 's agenda list , ; he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ?
Bro027_448	%--	Twelve times nine inputs , ; and a hundred , uh , hidden . ; Hidden ; and
Bmr012_671	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted ; Yeah , well , so what I mean is
Bed005_910	s	Robert was describing ; the There 's two packages ; there 's a , uh , quote parser , ; there 's a particular piece of this big system ,
Bed014_885	s	OK . ; Yeah , we need we need some Then we need to make some dates . ; Um . ; Meeting regular meeting time for the summer ,
Bro026_417	no	There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . ; Uh . ; I sort of think you should , ; but I don't know .
Bmr031_1534	s	and look at , uh , these numbers and see see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that . ; Um , I also recently wrote a script , um , that , uh , generates the kappa statistic , ; um , which is a for labeller agreement . ; Um , so , been looking at that as well .
Bmr010_848	%--	that would probably be , uh , sufficient to train models . ; That would be a really interesting prosodic feature , ; Then ; And let me ask y
Bmr027_289	s	Well , they 've already signed a form . ; Right . ; And the form says ; And nobody nobody really reads it anyway .
Bro003_1418	bk	Actually that was complicated , ; So you ; but well , I know how we can did that do that . ; Sure .
Bmr016_600	bk	Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , ; OK . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro007_198	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Now is TI di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ? ; Yeah .
Bro028_1165	s	and , um , improve speech recognition in that way . ; Um , so right now I 'm in in the phase where I 'm looking at at , um , deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories . ; And I 'm looking for data data - driven methods that can help me find , um , a set of intermediate categories of speech that , uh , will help me to discriminate later down the line . ; And one of the ideas , um , that was to take a take a neural net
Bns003_41	aa	Oh . ; Eh ; in principle , in his spare time . ; Yeah !
Bed013_1384	qw	And we can say , well , that 's all nonsense . A , ; A , uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse , B , ; B , don't ever occur really in discourse , ; but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as " where is the blah - blah " , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous .
Bro023_1617	b	Yeah . ; Um , ; Yeah , for for sure I will . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1797	bk	Sorry . ; Oh , digits . ; and and uh ; OK .
Bmr030_489	b	Yeah . Yeah , they 're working away . ; Th - they 're just doing their own thing , like , while they 're waiting . ; They 're just doing ; Right , right .
Bmr011_1844	b	Mm - hmm . ; Or even words inserted that weren't weren't there . ; Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_561	aa	Yeah there was that we ; that 's right , ; we had that one conversation about , uh , what what what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological , ; Right ,
Bmr006_309	s	But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . ; So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings ; But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them ; and that 's OK too .
Bmr026_538	s	Right . ; So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , ; Th - The ; I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .
Bro004_622	aa	It 's a noisy case ; but uh training and test noises are the same . ; Oh ! So this upper third ? ; So Yeah .
Bmr013_449	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . ; Mm - hmm . ; It might be a time gain .
Bns003_815	s	about two years ago the numbers of students were , um , studying computer science , uh , started to increase again ; and so in one or two years we will have , uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis ; and so I think there will also be , uh , many students which are joining in this work . ; So , hopefully , uh , I will found will find some students which are joining in
Bmr014_371	b	of Of non - digits . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , absolutely . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr024_481	s	Yeah . ; So , it 's basically ; s ; I think , eight meetings or something which which I 'm using ,
Bns002_674	s	And the second eh work , uh , it is about ; Oops ! ; It is about uh , an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for every for every single transmission . ; So , uh , in this second part of our work , we are using a different value for every single transmission .
Bed013_31	s	pick up my son ; come back here on the fourth of July . ; And uh . ; What a great time to be coming back to the
Bro005_814	t3	but there is also an the other difference , ; the fact that it 's it 's hand - labeled . ; Hey ! ; Um , just you can just sit here .
Bro012_587	b	we will fix fix the system ; and ; But we 've not discussed it it it this yet , ; yeah .
Bro003_745	s	D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on .
Bmr014_578	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So what what what 's the deal with with your
Bns002_932	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh is it worth to have it ? ; If I really , with a normal device uh with a battery lifetime of maybe twenty - four hours , thirty - six hours or whatever kind of thing And I think it will be increased . ; As the more mobile nodes are in the world the better the battery will be .
Bmr029_615	s	Um ; I mean , I can certainly help with , uh , retraining the short male models , ; Right . ; uh , once we have the new data .
Btr001_1087	s	OK . ; It 's rare . ; relatively rare . ; I don't think I ever have .
Bmr028_1493	qw	I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ? ; Hmm . ; And so that was important to know as a baseline . ; And and then , once you knew that , then s you go " well , now how do I know that that 's noisy ? "
Bns002_1285	%--	but nothing more . ; I don't expect any any more problem . ; even the the the own Bluetooth specification is also ; assuming that another Bluetooth or several Bluetooth networks c will be could be in the same area of space
Bmr022_1252	s	Ye - well , I don't see a real difference between RCS and any other system . ; I mean , it 's just mechanisms . ; The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying ; and if the changes don't overlap each other , they can just do it .
Bro013_266	b	Bless you . ; Thanks . ; I Yeah . I think it 's it 's ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_400	s	Nuh ? ; Uh , regardless of of of the input . Wh - Regardle ; Yeah , but But how does the expert but how does the expert system know how who which one to declare the winner , if it doesn't know the question it is , and how that question should be answered ? ; Based on the k what the question was , so what the discourse , the ontology , the situation and the user model gave us , we came up with these values for these decisions .
Bmr029_400	aa	Uh , that , uh since Dave 's experience was that it didn't help as much if you didn't retrain , but it does help some , that we would hopefully see that . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , that that 's that 's true .
Bmr019_836	s	Mm - hmm . ; And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . ; So I think you do have ; if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that .
Bns001_229	s	What kind of , uh , um , um , glue between these four building blocks exists ; and what kind of synergy effects , in principle , as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff . ; And what kind of service could we provide in that area . ; We will have these kind of , uh , really closely working together of these four building blocks .
Bmr002_233	ft	Um , ; OK . ; OK . Good . ; Thanks .
Bmr016_499	s	So , um , there are these digits , ; which are detached digits , ; but there are other words that contain the same general phon phoneme sequences . ; Like " wonderful " has " one " in it
Bro010_71	aa	No . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , you should talk with him . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed015_196	g	No , but ; Mm - hmm . ; just meaning . ; OK ?
Bmr002_327	qy	Do you sort of ; Are you going to have to make up what you do ; or do you have a very clear idea of what you 're going to do ? ; So I mean , is it is it Is this l Is it like something you 've done before ?
Bro012_671	bk	I used it a long time ago ; but it 's been a while ; so maybe I can ask you some questions . ; Oh .
Bsr001_1733	%	It 's something like tens of hours ; Mm - hmm . ; tens of hours of data , I think . ; M
Bed002_678	%--	is sort of ; s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? ; Mm - hmm . ; But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still
Bro024_1761	b	if you don't weigh differently the different condition , you can see that your well , the win the two - stage Wiener filtering is maybe better ; or ; It 's better for high mismatch , right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr007_876	s	I 'm I 'm not sure what you 're saying , ; can you try ; I mean that when when you use , eh eh any ; I think he 's saying the onset detector .
Bro010_1208	s	but in the uh the stream of features uh I guess . ; Yeah , ; OK . ; Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons
Bro014_1386	ar	Yeah . ; But ; And here ; No , well .
Bro021_589	s	So . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions
Bmr006_1797	s	Oh I see . ; Yeah . But I I also wanna say that people ; I see . ; And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore .
Bmr010_859	b	But if they laugh across three or four words you you get it after those four words . ; Right . ; Does that matter ? ; Yeah .
Bro003_1850	t3	Yeah , ; the tr the transcription , though , for Albayzin is n the transcription are of SAMPA the same , uh , how you say , symbol that SAMPA appear . ; SAMPA ? ; What does " SAMPA " mean ?
Bro023_238	s	You know . ; Yeah . ; " Hi , ; my name is so - and - so ,
Bro019_1314	bk	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr014_340	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_70	b	Good . ; Is my mike on ? ; And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK ; Yeah .
Bmr025_891	aa	right ? ; That would be fine too . ; You have the ; Right .
Btr001_2609	b	Yeah , I 've been just leaving it . ; And sometimes they don't . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1034	s	I mean , you sort of have a good estimate where these places are because the recognition 's so poor . ; Right ? ; And so you 're ; Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments .
Bro023_1024	s	So , ; well , ; basically that 's this idea , ; and it seems to give pretty good results ,
Bmr006_184	b	Uh - huh . ; but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_380	b	Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely . ; So , um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1271	s	If you wanna use the old ; You can actually never , though , really infer what you would get with a different ; That 's true . ; You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that .
Bmr012_172	s	so ; um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer ; which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams ; a bigram recognizer
Bns002_278	s	So ; we are um reserving a certain , and a specific uh , area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time . ; OK ? ; This is the basic idea .
Bns003_398	aa	when I tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working . ; Hmm . ; But the thing is that maybe this could be on a starting point or or if digest ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1085	s	Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . ; Good . ; Oh good . ; Th - but there 's going to be a real problem ,
Bed013_881	s	I can't believe that that 's never been thought of before . ; Wait , what are the dots ? ; I don't remember what the dots were . ; Those are little bugs .
Bed016_661	s	right ? ; Yeah , but it 's it 's it 's it 's Right . i Yeah , it 's more ; Forceful . ; But of course , no ,
Bmr019_1148	s	Y ; Hmm ! ; and , uh ; So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify
Bmr019_206	b	this , you know , very limited training HTK system . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording TI - digits . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1288	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1098	s	Hmm . ; um ; we have our we have our RASTA features and ; and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping , uh , from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space .
Bro013_772	s	OK . ; Is this a change from the last batch of of um forms ? ; Because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read . ; Yeah , it was orthographic ,
Bmr003_1334	s	Multichannels was also ; Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels . ; I see . ; So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen .
Bmr002_461	s	So the question is do you know of resources that we could use . ; So are there grad students or undergrads or just commercial services ? ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've I 've been involved with some of that . At at CogSci ,
Bmr001_636	b	because we 're not gonna have that many meetings ; Mm - hmm . ; and this is a pretty tiny amount of data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_246	b	they they combine error rates , ; but for the other languages they combine improvement . ; So it 's not very consistent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_630	s	perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . ; And he would like to replace these by a network ; which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . ; Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system .
Bro008_180	s	Um , and then there 's the whole standards process , which is another thing altogether . ; When is the development set I mean , the , uh , uh , test set results due ? ; Like the day before you leave or something ? ; Uh , probably the day after they leave ,
Bed003_1466	b	The Transcontinental Railroad , ; doesn't that ring a bell ? ; I think it has to exist somewhere . ; Yeah
Bmr019_1311	%	because you you really get g ; Yeah . ; Forces you to do the work . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1162	s	well , go go on . ; Uh , I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , um by looking at um , you know , uh I guess harmonics ; or looking across time ; Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though ,
Bmr010_599	b	Super . Super . ; It was just a question of getting , you know , the right people connected in , who had the time . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Right .
Bmr005_1070	%--	W what is the um the artifact you try to you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ? ; Ciao . ; Uh so it 's it you have a a direct uh ; Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would
Bmr002_743	s	OK . " MATE Mark - up Framework " . ; OK ? ; Right . ; " Specification of uh Coding workbench " ,
Bed006_1722	s	Because you 're not gonna get anymore information out of the action a as you find it there in the domain object . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; But then again um in this case , the domain object may contain information that we don't really care about either .
Bed011_890	aa	just a bit . ; Yeah , right ; well y i w if we w ; right .
Bmr025_729	qw	And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things , ; so . ; not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth ; and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ?
Bmr008_1731	s	Because because the the the problem is that we have different contexts . ; Yeah , something ; Different situation , and ; somethin something like that
Bsr001_201	s	Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow . ; No . ; those ; I 'm gonna pass out .
Bmr016_1786	b	Right . ; yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr023_347	b	but but the plan is just as , uh , Morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side , ; you know , ; rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_16	b	OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand , ; this is eh meeting number one with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock uh in the afternoon . ; A range of microphones . ; Yeah .
Bed014_536	s	Exactly . Yeah . ; Might be , yeah . ; And I guess , see , the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei ; f in the short run it 's more important to know how we would treat technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B , than it is t to decide A or B r right now .
Bed014_1028	b	At least for next week , there 's a lot of stuff we want to get done , ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; so why don't we plan to meet Monday ; Mmm .
Bmr031_1283	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , ; Yeah . ; so they 've been getting from us the , um you know , some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts
Bed008_592	b	And uh maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , ; I don't know , ; maybe maybe there 's more . ; Huh .
Bmr016_899	bk	Yeah , l I mean over all our data , we we want to not downsample . ; fe ; You 'd you wanna not . ; OK .
Bmr021_33	ba	I prefer these , ; but I don't mind using those . ; Right . ; Th - those are intimidating .
Bro027_501	%	Um ; then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . ; So it adds forty milliseconds . ; a
Bmr031_976	s	but it 's al always been either Mondays or Thursdays . ; So . ; Thursdays ? ; Yeah . They they often do it after
Bro024_1311	aa	So is the is the is the training is the training based on these labels files which you take as reference here ? ; Oh , it 's there . ; Wh - when you train the neural net y y you ; Yeah .
Bed003_978	s	OK . ; Maybe it did a little bit of learning , ; Oh right . ; I don't remember .
Bmr006_1509	b	It 's just ; Yeah . OK . I I 'll give you the short version , ; but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_740	s	and , ; um what else ? ; Uh , yeah , a good VAD . ; We put the good VAD .
Bed009_1025	b	So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh ; we 're trying to build a templ ; you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture . ; Mmm .
Bed009_251	s	So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically , ; Mm - hmm . ; but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it . ; Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used ,
Bed005_632	bk	and what do we want to request now that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bro023_135	s	Of of speech . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; The other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds ,
Btr002_2957	s	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and then they say a word .
Bmr013_566	s	Yeah . ; Uh , new version of , uh , presegmentation ? ; Uh , oh yeah , um , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , uh , speech - nonspeech detection . ; And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , uh , look in into the which is normalized energy , uh , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other .
Bed003_1371	s	what happens is you know the parser parses it ; and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . ; It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . ; It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted ,
Bed015_52	%--	let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , ; um , because that 's , ; I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people . ; OK , so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota
Bed008_1301	s	and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , ; right ? ; So for example here two people have voted for A , ; one has voted for V ,
Buw001_468	s	Their sort of note - taking application stuff ; they 've been doing for the last couple of years , ; and I don't think anyone is still working on it . ; I think they 're done .
Bed014_1313	b	So , internally , we should just do whatever works , ; Yeah . ; cuz it 's hard enough . ; Yeah .
Bed008_264	s	No no no , ; Uh ; Well some of those are subsumed by approach . ; these are ju that 's just a point ,
Btr002_2575	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , once , Adam was laughing , ; and it was actually written out phonetically , ; and I changed it .
Bro016_103	%--	Um . ; Yeah . I didn't even write them down . ; I I I don't remember . ; I would need to
Bmr016_1090	aa	anything starting with X is scratch . ; OK . ; With two two digits . ; Two digits , right ,
Bed012_547	s	No . ; You can compute , uh , the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes , given some other nodes , ; but totally ignore some other nodes , also . ; Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over .
Btr002_2472	s	People talk about , you know , " Oh gee , that was really good , " ; Mmm . ; and then they do a ; I 'm not gonna do it
Bmr027_186	bd	Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish . ; Yeah . Sorry . ; Mm - hmm . ; It was it was not the best characterization .
Btr002_286	%--	Right . ; Sometimes , though , it does sound like they ended a sentence ; Yeah . ; and then I do
Bmr019_837	s	And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one . ; So I think you do have ; if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that . ; But it 'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your Waves stuff .
Bro017_1064	b	Yeah , I know , ; right . ; So if you could hook that up so it hit the keyboard ; Yeah .
Bro005_859	s	but um , um It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . ; It depends how good the recognizer is ; Mm - hmm . ; that 's that the the engine is that 's doing the alignment .
Bmr023_150	b	So . But but it 's not ; Just with with age , kind of . ; With age . Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr003_1860	b	Alright . ; and ; I I 'd like to be able to to pore through , you know , the the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro016_562	%--	You know , maybe there 's parameters that other people have used ; you know , th that they have tuned in some way for other things . ; So it 's it 's , uh ; We should we should
Bmr029_464	s	No . It means No . It just means ; you you group together the segments that by magic you know belong to one speaker , ; and and treat ; I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way , too ,
Bmr021_320	2	I didn't know that . ; Right . ; And actually , s the sound tools don't understand that . For the ; At least Feacalc doesn't .
Bmr006_363	b	There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have . ; So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_406	s	Yeah , I wasn't saying that . ; So , it 's um ; Right ? ; I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it .
Bmr026_535	b	I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room . ; Right . ; So . ; Right .
Bro010_244	s	Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh , finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ? ; Um , we had a silence detector , ; so ; we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector .
Bns001_335	no	But that 's uh one thing of the internet , ; right ? ; It 's should be able to unplug a host , bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be . ; I 'm not sure i if it 's uh if you really have to con uh save a connection for all applications ,
Bro028_555	%	Yeah . ; On digits . ; And this is so so still the baseline . ; OK .
Bmr016_652	s	and it 's picking up all of Morgan 's words pretty well ; and so the rec you know , there 're error rates ; because of insertion ; Insertions aren't bounded ,
Bmr022_610	s	Unless you wanna know if they 're ; Right . ; Otherwise you just count up the total number of beeps . ; And we can do that with wordcount .
Bed006_281	ba	Right , ; so they 'll have a little bit more natural interaction ? ; OK . ; Hopefully .
Bed012_567	b	I mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time . ; So either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes , and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bns002_566	%	Uh - huh . ; But I 'm thinking about this example you gave before . ; Maybe maybe you are right . ; S
Bmr020_1905	b	Uh , quarter to four . ; Oh , OK . ; that 's that 's a nice fast way to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_710	s	Yeah , ; I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . ; with all these minor things modified . ; And then do other things ,
Buw001_1198	s	um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . ; So he has very little manpower . ; Um , there 's very little allocated for him ; and also he 's pretty focused on user interface .
Bns003_149	%--	H ; But no telnet . ; Hmm . ; Uh because you can
Bmr020_1240	%--	Yeah ? ; OK . ; So I mean , you 're still gonna ; So we 're
Bmr012_1356	ar	Yeah . ; Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ? ; Yeah . ; No I don't think it 's confusing .
Bmr026_154	s	So I think , we 'll have something . ; It may not be as As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something . ; I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . ; He 's sort of been been volunteering for everything
Bed016_630	b	But " run into " does . ; Yeah , but , y y if you find " walked smacked into the cafe " or " slammed into the wall " ; Yeah , no , but " run into " does . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_282	s	Tha - that 's what they do . ; Well , they are doing that . ; Yeah . ; No , that is relative .
Bro012_105	s	you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad ; uh because there 's many features that are still preserved . ; So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different , ; an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well .
Buw001_1107	ba	Yeah . ; Good . ; For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired . ; That 's better .
Bns001_587	s	I was ; And uh I don't know what avail information is available ; because I didn't find the time currently to check it out . ; It 's a project of the UC .
Bed005_1445	s	Yeah , but I 'm just ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet . ; But , at that point you may say , " hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town .
Bmr028_534	2	We need to get a critical mass for that . ; However , I just got an email from Thilo saying that we are ready to run ; I mean , we have segmentations for the old meetings that are from his segmenter , ; And check the segmentations .
Bmr003_457	b	cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . ; Oh . ; Great . ; Yep .
Bmr031_826	ba	Yeah . ; or completed transcription , ; and it also includes , uh , checked . ; So it includes a lot of categories together .
Bmr026_384	s	I don't know . ; I don't know what his schedule is . ; You we need about a gig per meeting . ; I 'm just saying he 's gone .
Bmr027_1286	s	Or extra disk ? ; These are gonna go onto Abbott . ; Ne - new disks . ; Onto Abbott ,
Bmr028_640	b	You know , you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times , ; If ; We could ; Right .
Bmr007_315	b	Yeah . ; They 're not double counted . ; Yeah . ; Ah but , yeah .
Bmr021_988	no	because uh even ; What are people doing , ; they 're switching their mikes off or something ? ; I don't know what they do .
Bmr012_1105	s	so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen ; and there 's six on the table ; Right . ; so that 's nine .
Bmr003_2548	aa	well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other . ; So ; So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ? ; Uh , y yeah .
Bmr023_825	aa	So . ; Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ? ; Good . ; Exactly . Yeah .
Bns001_1793	bk	OK ? ; So , thanks ; OK ; OK
Bed013_925	s	User ? ; Ontology . ; What about the utterance ? ; That 's here .
Bro022_644	b	Yeah . ; Right ? ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1728	b	Why do you have to know his name ? ; OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what uh , what Jose said . " ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1164	s	so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have . ; We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed , ; we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , ; and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really
Bro013_601	s	and the the harmonics are resolved by the f ; Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , ; Mm - hmm . ; and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .
Bro003_1445	s	and and go that way . ; Oh , yeah , yeah , ; sure . ; No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops ,
Bmr028_661	s	H he did , and then it didn't work , ; Couldn't format them . ; and ; No .
Bro019_1050	s	Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . ; But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News . ; So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation ; and some of the focus conditions were noisy
Bed006_1772	bk	Who doesn't like to be a ; Everybody likes action . ; Oh . ; Yeah . OK .
Bro027_1542	s	exactly . ; Cuz they don't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's why I was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea .
Bmr018_454	b	And it 's sort of a a hack but I mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form . ; I think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_231	%--	Um ; In a way ; So , uh , let me be sure I understand . ; So , you 're saying s
Bed006_86	no	About me . ; OK . OK . ; You could do it about you . ; Well I didn't know .
Bed011_1042	s	OK , and hi ; OK . ; let me f th say what I think is is ; so the idea is uh first of all I misspoke when I said we thought you should do the constructions .
Bmr024_353	aa	Well , I guess yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits . ; We should be able to . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_918	s	Well , I 'm ; Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . ; And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . ; And uh so then I 'll train the net .
Bmr002_357	bk	And you just , you know , if it 's word level e you know , you do a e a r I just hit the r re the rewind button every couple of words ; Play . ; and type what I know ; Yeah .
Bro014_156	s	um , ; uh , I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 'll it really increases what we can run on .
Bmr003_580	s	So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , forty minutes to an hour , ; As a pilot study .
Bro012_1108	s	Because as as you 've mentioned . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next ,
Bro026_262	aa	Then finally , we compute delta and we put the neural network also . ; Right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . And then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization . ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1104	qw	Right . Mixed . ; the the mix , mixed speech . ; " Mixed " . Thank you . ; Eh , why ?
Bmr028_283	s	So , is the end of the month still the the d ? ; Right . The week after th th ; The Monday the week after next is July second , ; which is the first day I get back .
Bed009_867	s	Yeah , I guess that 's the point is is all the morphology and stuff . ; The word order is is uh not fixed ; And English is all th all word order . ; And it makes a lot more sense .
Bro010_1141	b	one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one ; and , um , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . ; And so we 're interested in , um , comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_566	br	I would think , ; yeah . ; Mmm . ; Huh ?
Buw001_1240	s	Becau - in terms of like informativeness , ; That 's a good one . ; it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . ; I would think that would be the most likely thing .
Bmr019_967	qrr	For example , there 's no speaker identification after that line . ; Uh - huh . ; Is that what you 're talking about ? ; Or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the a Adam was ?
Bmr025_282	ba	Well this is one of the reasons ; They 're both Tcl interfaces . ; This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart Gelbart ; Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing
Bro005_1357	b	Ah ! ; I see . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed011_18	s	It has a mind . ; Got it . ; Wants to conserve . ; But I I just You know , sort of keep on wiggling .
Bro013_32	b	Well , yeah . ; In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas uh in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro028_763	b	I don't know if they do that . ; I 'm not really sure . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Buw001_796	s	Hmm ? ; Hmm . ; And they they didn't actually align it or anything . ; They just they have it , though .
Bed012_60	ar	right ? ; Which I don't think is this . ; Although I don't know . ; No , it 's certainly not this .
Bro018_36	s	The feature the input ? ; The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature . ; Uh - huh . ; the with the new code .
Btr001_1954	s	and ; It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things . ; Yeah . ; It 's really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe
Bns002_1312	g	S So I think some really nice applications will will appear . ; OK we 'll when I I will have some problems in the future with my l wireless LAN and Bluetooth connectivity , ; I will come to you , ; you will solve it OK ?
Bmr029_608	%--	Um ; S So , um . ; I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff . ; What what can I do to ?
Bed014_1351	b	Mm - hmm . ; and um ; that 's , you know , I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done . ; Yeah .
Bro005_41	bk	OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done ; Go ahead . ; It 's this . ; Oh . OK .
Bns003_904	s	Later . ; I will write as long as I have time here , uh , on the proposal itself ; and in the near - term future , I will distribute a list of the small cluster of people . ; I tried to access Juan Peire several times ,
Bmr014_536	%--	but ; Yeah . ; But she knew that she didn't know it . ; Maybe it was a technical ter
Bmr010_93	%--	And for Broadcast News , that was fine . ; Here obviously it 's not . ; Yeah . ; And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um ,
Bmr003_2265	s	And I I was gonna do this very clever phantom power ; and I decided a couple days ago not to do it . ; Hmm ! ; So I 'm ready to build it .
Bro003_1224	s	Yeah . ; How big is the net ? ; For Albayzin I trained on neural network , ; uh , was , um , one day also .
Bmr019_522	qh	Right . So we we can do that . ; And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on on that particular set , ; Yeah . ; uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?
Bmr030_206	s	Yeah , I see . ; I mean , the talk 's only twenty minutes . ; It 's just gonna be a couple of ; So . You know , all this time we spent on it 's gonna be thirty seconds of screen time .
Buw001_1492	%--	I mean , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . ; And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? ; Well , we 're gonna ; So you need to have some sort of
Bro007_437	b	and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen . ; Multi - condition multi - condition . ; So they have looks like they have ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1200	%--	Give PX and , uh , P the noise . ; X K C noise . ; Mmm . ; And I can put that this is equal to the noise signal minus
Bro014_674	bk	So ; we 'll see what happen with this . ; And ; Yeah .
Bro007_4	s	So ; uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying ; and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual ; but um got tables in front of us .
Bro024_1142	s	and then I just put a median filtering on this ; to smooth the probabilities , right ? ; Um ; I didn't use the the scheme that 's currently in the proposal
Bed003_1697	br	And I talked to Liz about this ; and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . ; So who would be the subject of this trial run ? ; Pardon me ?
Bed016_1062	s	which a tourist w ; Huh ? ; Would you really say that ? ; A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . "
Btr001_970	aa	And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says " and " versus " nnn " versus , you know , " nd " , whatever ; Mm - hmm . ; all the different ways of reducing " and " . ; That 's true .
Bed013_746	qw	Yeah . ; Parsing done right , interpretation done right , example . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . And ; And how much to get into the cognitive neural part ?
Bns001_1696	qw	or something like ; or over ether ; Why ? ; What kind what kind IP over what do you call it ?
Bro027_1337	s	mm - hmm . ; Um . ; So what 's the overall effe ; I mean , you haven't done all the experiments
Bed003_1382	s	so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , ; so as in " No I really don't want to see that movie . ; I 'd rather stay home and watch TV " ; um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model ,
Bro027_80	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Is this oh , from the from ; It
Bmr024_288	s	and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? ; And so I 've uh , I , uh , uh , I 've trained the new one uh , the new the newest one , to , um , use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . ; And that 's just amazingly helpful . ; Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation .
Bmr010_865	s	Right . ; So ; Yeah . ; But , um , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking ,
Bmr003_1206	ba	Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount . ; Mmm . ; Yep , yep . ; Good point .
Btr002_1033	b	Mm - hmm . ; So , like I only have one I have one versus two of the others . ; I think so . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1491	aa	A lot of overlapping , yeah . ; Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_1062	s	sort of like Nancy did in some of the er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom ; so you can do f you know , f f uh have a complete story ov of s of some piece of dialogue . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's gonna be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or or or something like that .
Bns001_937	no	I don't know what statuses . ; Maybe they already did it par as part of UMTS , ; I 'm not sure . ; I don't have a clue .
Bed011_232	s	well , uh th I think there are two places where it comes up . ; One is uh in the th these people who are gonna take this and and try to do speech with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh Lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you better data than l you know , a few pronunciations of lots more things .
Bmr020_1492	b	but w I mean we 're gonna adjust everything when we come back ; But what what we would like them to do is be conservative ; so that they should only write down the transcript if they 're sure . ; Yeah .
Bro019_103	aa	Um , ; there 's a c ; How about an email that points to the FAQ , ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed003_424	g	So that 's given in their input . ; Right . ; So ; Right ?
Bed017_495	b	so it 's a little bit easier for me . ; Well . Uh , you have to s still m understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1204	s	I mean , is " CUZ " always meaning " because " ? ; Yes , but not the reverse . ; So sometimes people will say " because " in the meeting , ; and if if they actually said " because " , then it 's written as " because " with no w
Bmr019_1007	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Well , ; I think ; That 's interesting .
Bmr001_801	b	Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript , if the near field mike does a reasonably good job ? ; Hmm . ; I bet it isn't , unless it 's really close to right . ; Yeah .
Bed014_530	s	One ; Or in some cases , it 's it 's quite definitely ; Yeah . ; s so that you just know wanna know where it is .
Bed014_716	s	Is it just that the s synonym selection is better , or ? ; Oh , wel Well , the ar the The argument is that you 're gonna have the ; If you 've recognized the word , ; you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it ,
Btr002_1150	s	OK . So now , ha ha who would 've ; Yes . ; So , if you have a strong ; Now you 're bi - keyboardal
Bmr013_844	s	Go ahead . ; And this afternoon . ; and this afternoon , ; it drifted into the afternoon , uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer .
Btr002_3220	s	One of them is , um ; Oh , yeah . ; This is an interesting category to me , ; and I don't , um , y y don't have to mark this systematically .
Bro005_345	b	is it . ; Uh , two point six out of eighteen . ; About , um sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_504	%--	So we ; Routing ? ; So so we went through uh uh to through multicast . ; So this architecture with m
Bed004_303	%--	And , then um just see how a discussion goes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sounds good . ; The uh other two things is um
Bmr014_458	s	Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear ; Yeah . ; but uh there are things that are not so well known , in ; or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say " nine two " or you can say " ninety - two " ,
Bns003_499	aa	Mm - hmm . ; For instance I have my USAIA slides . ; maybe if some things and is going on maybe you have some Multicast slides concerning your work at IGMP ; Yeah ,
Btr001_770	ba	Mm - hmm . ; So ; I don't know . ; That 's kind of interesting .
Bmr021_1010	no	The question is , when the software detects it , what do you want it to do ? ; Exactly . ; That 's a good question . ; I don't know .
Bmr016_819	s	So . ; OK . ; So , I mean , I guess my question would be is ; I just got this new eighteen gig drive installed .
Bmr021_787	s	the phone loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths ; and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation , ; but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it . ; And then , you know , so we have the the SRI front - end
Btr002_677	b	but I 'm just curious . ; One source was , there was a problem with a connection ; where the microphone went int went into a box ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_900	b	and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features . ; Uh - huh . ; So one thing that I did notice , yesterday I was studying the um the uh RASTA code ; Uh - huh .
Bmr001_463	s	I hadn't even thought about that , although it 'd be kind of interesting . ; Yeah . ; What would you do ? ; You typically train I mean you 'd have fi you 'd have fifty hours
Bro027_943	s	Uh - huh . ; So having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they aren't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse . ; I mean , you 're right . ; If you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help .
Bsr001_1413	%--	Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's quite an interesting issue . ; So that 's something we should try to ; That brings up
Btr002_2787	%--	Interesting . ; OK , well , let 's see , ; so , um , do you think that this has changed your speech n in other ways , ; in terms of
Btr002_1701	aa	and then s be some horrible thing , " The transcriber 's gonna have trouble with this . @ @ " ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing , um , clicks like from African languages ? ; Yes .
Bro012_689	s	but I mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; They hear that it 's lower amplitude and they hear there 's a second voice ,
Bro022_370	s	Mm - hmm . ; to make it ; Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , ; but maybe in practice it is .
Btr002_1365	b	Yeah . ; and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds . ; Cuz they were reading from a script . ; Yeah .
Bns002_247	s	so , he will conclude that no other transmission is going on , ; and he will start transmitting . ; And if he does , what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission , ; and this will produce , at least at these two nodes , a collision or a m a m a a re a bad reception .
Bmr025_601	s	OK . ; OK , disk backup , et cetera ? ; Oh ; Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup
Bed015_1733	s	People have talked about it this way . ; And you know , you can do sort of special things . ; You can , th ; put just the phrase " I think " as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth .
Btr002_2588	ba	Change it to " laugh " . ; That 's funny . ; Yeah , i I it was maybe Tigerfish had done something ; Well done .
Bmr019_289	s	Right . ; If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor . ; So , um ; I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do .
Buw001_598	qw	Yeah . ; Do they ? ; There 's uh a person with a laptop at each meeting . ; How many people are those meetings ?
Bmr005_543	aa	I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that . ; But it 's known . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro022_217	s	And , ; um , ; what if you did ? ; I mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation .
Bmr001_336	b	I mean . ; Except I s got a PDA way before ; Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable computers at Boeing , so I guess I sort of count . ; OK .
Bmr023_711	s	whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts ; because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,
Bsr001_1180	s	but we can blend it for the public . ; Uh . ; and that 's sorta how I got involved . ; I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of do something .
Bed009_159	s	Oh that 's true . ; He 's off off on his trip already . ; but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer . ; Thilo .
Bns002_1417	s	Kill the computer . ; Uh , So I started uh , for for advertising the project proposal here to provide a few slides ; I think , first of all , Wilbert , is not here , ; second um , the um link here was uh enabling UMTS services and application ,
Bmr027_896	bk	You could put wed bugs in the email . ; I see . ; How m ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1236	s	Um , ; but right now I guess , uh , I 'm working on this paper this ISCA paper for this workshop that Liz and Andreas and I are putting together . ; So we 're just getting , uh , different results for ; Um , we fixed up our different , uh , transcripts with different types of , uh , annotations
Bmr013_762	b	Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I didn't know in the group you had if you had ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1285	s	I I remember that . ; It 's much worse . ; Yeah . ; So there must be some something else going on .
Bed005_1126	bk	One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? " ; Yeah , it 's a good question . ; Um The so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions . ; Right .
Bed004_98	%--	The names and um ; this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system , ; and um then of course the system broke down , ; and those were the l uh uh
Bro018_17	b	Yeah , we ; the Aurora system . ; yeah the Aurora system with the new filter , VAD or something like that . ; OK .
Bro027_1343	s	Y yeah , oh . ; Yeah . ; so I wonder what the net effect is . ; I d I I think it 's it was one or two percent .
Bro022_631	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's about the same ,
Bro003_1467	s	And , uh , ; I still think we could do a lot of them . ; I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something . ; But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something ,
Bed012_504	s	We just compose as an output an XML mes message that says . " Go there now . " " Enter historical information . " ; And not care whether that 's consistent with anything . ; Right ? ; But in this case if we say , " definitely he doesn't want to go there . He just wants to know where it is . "
Bmr022_875	t3	Another one just bit the dust . ; yeah , nobody will remember how to repair a Jimbox or a Jimlet or a ; Really ? ; I think there 's a problem with this one .
Bmr028_1748	%--	Yep . ; so ; Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power . ; we can afford we can a
Bdb001_835	2	you you could use the XML to put the data in , ; and then when you get data out , you put it back in XML . ; So use XML as sort of the the transfer format , ; Transfer .
Bro013_558	%--	if s @ @ val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , you probably want
Bro019_667	b	Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet ; so . ; But the the well - matched may still ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_435	qrr	OK . ; and ; The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ? ; Or also unknown ?
Bed008_692	b	Right . ; It does . ; Yeah , but ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_497	bk	So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . ; Yeah . Cuz sh ; Maybe they can be little ones . ; Right .
Bmr006_236	b	What 's that ? ; Age - ist . ; Well , age - ist . The " eighteen " is because of the consent form . ; Right , Yeah .
Btr001_2540	s	I i and he 's m e they they have this nice @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on , ; and he says , " Well , I could explain this to you . ; I have a better laugh than you do . ; The transcribers told me so . "
Bed010_912	s	Yes , ; yeah , ; good . ; and uh , it 's a and still , I think , you know , get something done .
Btr001_589	b	You couldn't visually do it , ; no . ; Huh . ; Euh .
Bed015_361	aa	Well , there 's an alternative to this ; At least in English . ; which is , um The question was did we want directed motion , ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1468	ba	uh ; We 've got two hours of space now . ; He he he changed the downsampling . ; Oh really .
Bro027_2071	aa	Guess we 're done . ; Should we do digits ? ; Digits ? ; Yep .
Bed008_361	s	uh at least two . ; One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology ; now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that ; I think we can
Bro005_376	s	You used two thirds of it , ; Yeah . ; you think . ; So , it it 's still it hurts you seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish .
Bed004_469	b	Well , mmm , something . ; I mean , so uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples kicking around , ; so he may have some good intuition about you know , what are the crucial things . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_342	b	Absolutely . ; y Absolut ; things after the f then ; Yeah .
Bro027_558	b	At th At the input . ; Twenty for delta . ; I mean , that 's at the input to the net . ; Yeah .
Bed006_620	b	But uh it 'll tell you that this is what 's showing in Heidelberg and there you go . ; Yeah . ; And the presentation agent will go " Hhh ! " Nuh ? ; OK .
Bmr010_1410	s	I gues I guess I don't remember either . ; Uh . It 's been a while . ; Javier ; Yeah . Uh , I could have a look at it .
Bro003_1449	b	right ? ; And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that , ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1141	b	Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . ; That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_918	s	So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , ; first of the colo colored noise ; Yeah . ; and then make the noise white ,
Btr001_653	b	It 's interesting . ; Huh . ; I don't know . ; Huh .
Bmr015_176	s	And the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the the numerics . ; Uh , yes , ; although we could switch it back . ; The problem was O and zero .
Bro003_593	s	Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that . ; But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there . ; Yeah , ; and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning ,
Bmr020_1861	aa	And give them freedom to to indicate if it 's just not workable . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bmr027_888	ba	You you read email in VI ? ; Yeah . ; So I i ; Yeah . I like VI .
Bmr003_1339	qy	Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? ; Why 'd they develop it ? ; For this exact task ? ; Are they linguists ?
Bro013_318	s	Yeah , for sure we will do something for the special session . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's fine . ; So th so so we have a couple a couple little things on Meeting Recorder
Bmr019_1822	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Simultaneous digit chocolate task . ; I I think , eh , it 's enough , eh , for more peopl for more people after .
Btr002_3416	aa	Oh we did ! ; Yeah . ; Oh ! ; Right .
Bmr020_1247	aa	and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? For for sending to to IBM ; or ? ; Yeah . ; Exactly .
Bmr021_217	s	Hmm . ; Um . ; Also , we 're pro I wanna double check with Morgan , ; he did say yes before I went to Japan on buying another wireless system
Btr002_2385	s	Mmm . ; Oh , OK . ; It would be it would ; Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones .
Bro004_489	b	so a high number is bad . ; Yeah , this is a word error rate ratio . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_498	s	So that shouldn't really matter too much . ; I mean it does matter ; because it does have to keep track of you ; we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth
Bmr028_1460	s	is ; No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating . ; Well , it 's it 's ; I think you 're saying " in my experiment , I cheated in this way " .
Bed015_476	b	Yeah . No , I think I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details ; Mm - hmm . ; but my intuition would be that that 's right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1609	bk	w except for that last thirty minutes I haven't checked yet . ; So CTS is really big here , ; Yeah , I wonder what it is . ; yeah .
Bro005_895	s	Yeah . ; But ; Yeah . ; Results are only coming for for this net .
Bsr001_922	b	So they , you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this , you know , you 'd turn off your radio . ; Yes . ; That 's right , with all the i interrupts . ; Right .
Bmr022_834	s	Yeah . ; don't they ? ; Specially . ; You know . I mean , here 's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity .
Bmr009_623	s	normalization window . ; Eh because eh if we have a type of , a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible eh to normali ; i i that if we normalize eh with eh eh consider only the the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh side on the right side overlapping with a a very eh oh a small window ; eh the if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short
Bmr031_420	d	You can do it , I think . ; Yeah ? ; Oh , absolutely you can do it . ; It 's not lossy ?
Bro018_921	aa	Mm - hmm . ; um ; When you get the mel When you go to the mel scale . ; Right .
Bro021_1085	aa	I think these things are a lot clearer when you can use fonts different fonts there ; Oh , yes . ; so you know which is which . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr029_683	s	OK . ; And there 's , um , ; S so the way this means subtraction expects to work , is it expects to have , um , this continuous stream of audio data from a particular speaker to operate on . ; And it goes along it with this sliding window , calculating the mean using the data in the window ,
Bmr015_131	%--	Four thous Ah ! Four thousand . ; Four thousand ? ; Yeah , ; it 's
Bed015_1588	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Right , it was a space builder . ; Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces
Bed016_592	s	Even though One could argue what if there are basic cases , even . ; I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free . ; Oh , nothing is context - free , ; but there are basic cases .
Bmr008_1594	%--	but eh I test different normalization ; I eh ; What kind of normalization ? ; I I
Bro023_1336	d	What if you just look into the past ? ; It 's , uh , not as good . ; It 's not bad . ; How m by how much ?
Bed003_980	bk	Oh right . ; I don't remember . ; Maybe you 're right . ; OK .
Bmr011_56	s	Uh , uh , John Fiscus ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , I think George Doddington will be around as well . ; Uh , OK , so we can talk about that .
Bro003_1205	%--	Oh , ; I don't know how w how we would P - make this , though . ; Um . ; Well , you have a
Bed003_1277	s	And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that . ; Yep . ; And so forth and so forth . ; Then we have context .
Bmr029_397	s	I mean the other thing which which it might come in to is if there was some problem in the retraining . ; I mean , maybe you 'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that , uh since Dave 's experience was that it didn't help as much if you didn't retrain , but it does help some , that we would hopefully see that .
Bmr010_662	no	Um , ; That 'd be ; I have it downstairs . ; I don't remember off the top of my head .
Bed006_715	s	Well , that wouldn't have helped you at all . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Basically , what this is is that there 's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner
Bmr031_1497	b	But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the take the pitch from the real data , feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data . ; Yeah . ; so I ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1415	b	You can actually continuously vary it between the two . ; And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones . ; And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_561	s	but You were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds , ; Right . ; Right . ; but then Chuck came in
Bro027_1006	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I guess if the ; These are all
Bed013_1159	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; So is the question ; I mean it 's just that I 'm not sure what the
Bed006_1500	b	Oh ! ; um . Yeah . ; Promote them , ; yeah .
Bed005_918	s	Right . ; Right . ; The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , uh , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure ; which is instructions for the generator .
Bed004_604	%--	Mm - hmm . ; But that 's not It 's not the immediate problem . ; Right . ; But , presumably that that that functionality 's there when when we
Bed014_904	b	Yeah , it was th ; OK . It was th off this week , ; Yeah . I always thought it was staying . ; yeah .
Bro010_97	b	Um , ; We just we just have to be in contact more . ; I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1329	s	But . ; Must do . Yeah . ; There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue . ; So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error .
Bed015_1713	s	Mmm , isn't I mean , I 'm I was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space ; and then builds up ; Mm - hmm . ; d doesn't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , that whenever I say something I could preface that with " I think . "
Bro003_1543	b	Yeah , ; I think , yeah . ; I think so . ; Mmm .
Btr002_2574	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , once , Adam was laughing , ; and it was actually written out phonetically ,
Bed009_519	%	OK . ; And the language end doesn't know that . ; OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine . ; hmm
Btr001_2168	%--	I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really . ; I don't
Bro027_1509	%--	I mean , it everybody believes it , ; Oh , no ; it 's a g ; but you know , we just
Bmr014_1226	s	I and so i and we 're not having these discussions which ; Yeah . ; I I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable , in other people 's speech or in my own . ; Yeah . You would think it would be rare ,
Bmr025_814	s	unless someone ; There is an alternative , ; I mean , it 's still , there 's uh you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , ; but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it .
Bed012_893	b	Yeah , they would still c sort of get the closest , best fit . ; Well , yeah , but I mean , the uh , I mean , that 's what the construction parser would do . ; Uh , I mean , if you said something completely arbitrary , it would f find the closest construction , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_132	bk	And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite uh , the German concept uh syntax - to - prosody rules ; I didn't know she spoke German . ; No , she doesn't . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr008_891	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK . ; So it 's just in the section talking about language .
Btr002_291	aa	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; like sometimes it 's just like , " That 'd be hard , so " . ; Right .
Bro005_803	%--	Um , because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency
Bed011_986	b	see this this this uh ontology node is probably something that I will try to expand . ; Once we have the full ontology API , what can we expect to get from the ontology ? ; And hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1180	s	so it could actually contain several meetings . ; Um . ; And the second column is the channel . ; Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words .
Bmr026_787	s	t ; With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that .
Bed016_909	%--	Where you can get baked goods . ; Well th well , that 's one . ; You want to buy something . ; But the other is ,
Bmr006_804	qw	Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? ; Which catege which category ? ; Like a c ; Where ? Where What is the class ?
Bmr019_887	%	We have two . ; Yeah . ; Just ha uh , trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1562	%--	so . I mean ; Oh . ; Well if there 's any left we can grab it . ; If there was pie again ,
Bmr022_1450	b	So we can I think we can do this . ; Or just , yeah , start by make it a really tight control ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_896	s	Uh , ; so . ; So . ; So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine
Bed009_785	s	was Do you know something about that ? ; Tubingen was at least involved in putting the chunks together ; In Tub - at ; I can't quite recall whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place .
Bmr010_337	ba	That 's great . ; And , um , so my my goal was w m my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month . ; And it 'll be I 'm I 'm I 'm clear that we 'll be able to do that . ; That 's great .
Bdb001_1068	bk	So now that they have come up with a format , it doesn't it seems pretty reasonable to use it . ; Mmm . ; But let me look at it again . ; OK ,
Bmr015_1116	s	OK . But that would maybe include a pause as well , ; So ; Well , there 's a there 's ; and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ?
Bed009_309	%--	So well , let me Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig
Bed013_701	fa	Really ? ; Oh . OK , but I was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm . ; But coconut anana pineapple , that 's that 's tricky , yeah . ; Sorry .
Bmr003_1164	b	three hundred . ; Right , ; I w got an extra factor of three there . ; Right .
Bmr015_1185	ba	then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now . ; I mean you can ; Yeah . ; you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well .
Btr002_3011	%--	Man ! ; I 'm glad you ment brought that up ; yeah . ; because I actually
Btr002_43	ft	Thanks very much . Thanks very much . ; Alright . ; So . Uh , welcome back . ; Thank you for coming .
Bro027_2062	bk	um ; so the evaluation should be on a week before ; or ; Yeah .
Bmr010_165	s	Hopefully . ; OK . ; It 's just our our old Munich , uh , loudness - based spectrum ; on mel scale twenty twenty critical bands and then loudness .
Bmr014_468	no	OK . ; and potentially they 'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards ; e ; but I 'm not sure if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,
Bmr030_666	qw	Um , ; We have new equipment that I 'm gonna try to set up tomorrow . ; New wireless . ; What will that do ?
Bed015_596	s	We usually don't know the point of the sentence at all . ; Yeah . ; But we know what it 's trying to say . ; We we know that it 's what predication it 's setting up .
Bed011_810	%--	Yeah . ; Right , that 's true . ; Right . ; The what what my sort of sentiment is they 're
Buw001_2018	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1744	s	Yeah . ; And so , um , ; over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot . ; But if there if in fact there 's something else that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're we 're sort of uh strapped for time
Bmr020_1538	s	or ; You know . ; Yeah , ; the the problem is that , nnn , the numbers Ian gave in the paper is just uh , some frame error rate .
Bed008_1535	b	that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions ; and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer ; so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_953	aa	It might be worth uh asking around . ; Um . ; Like , we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of ; Yeah .
Bro004_1241	s	Hmm . ; I mean that 's sort of what the way I had imagined would happen is that on the other side , ; yeah ; you p put some low level noise or something .
Bmr003_348	s	Yeah , it 's noticeable . ; Well , not clear . ; Maybe it Maybe it isn't . ; Well it 's well like " low " is mid mid - scale .
Bmr014_733	s	if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . ; So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , ; Well , no fre for the most ; we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people
Bro023_1122	s	and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , um , coefficients of the impulse response . ; But . ; So , basically it 's similar . ; I mean , what you did , it 's similar
Bro022_1103	%--	Yeah . ; There are a few ; very ; not a lot of
Bmr028_508	s	Well , SRI people , easy to f find . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know .
Bmr001_594	b	Cuz you you can't have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million parts , ; Right . ; so . ; Right .
Bmr009_626	bs	eh the if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel .
Bdb001_380	s	Is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration ; or does that just sort of , uh a nice thing to have ? ; I I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data . ; But I thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding .
Bro024_249	bk	Go ahead . ; I mean , that you just take what you have from the past , ; that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean . ; OK .
Bro012_428	s	So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important . ; I see . I see . ; Yeah . ; That makes sense .
Bed014_722	s	Mmm . ; Oh , I see . ; since you had to recognize it anyway . ; That that 's the argument in the other direction .
Bro027_842	bk	Yeah ? ; Um , so it 's makes forty - five features that are used as input to the HTK . ; And then , there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem MLP . ; Oh , oh .
Bro024_924	g	Uh - huh . ; So it Cuz I mean , I think this is most interesting for the mel filters . ; Uh - huh . ; Right ?
Bed017_257	s	But , ; the um , ; as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details . ; So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it
Bmr007_578	b	I ju I I think that in this meeting I really had the feeling that wasn't happening , that the hostile hostile type . ; These were these were benevolent types , as people finishing each other 's sentences , and stuff . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2585	s	I still don't really know . ; OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth , ; you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , ; and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all ,
Bns001_993	%	uh it 's a part of a of design like the the ; the terminal has a WAP stick . ; And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick . ; So yeah .
Bro023_1418	aa	isn't it the TCP buffer some ? ; You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ,
Bmr008_498	s	Um , I don't think we can do that because it would be different for ; Does that mean region of ; Region of the US , or region of the world ; If you 're American English it would be region of the US .
Bmr008_334	co	yeah , so we ca we have these age ranges or something ? ; Oh , right . ; Well it ; Well , wait wait wait wait a minute ,
Bmr019_1009	b	I think ; That 's interesting . ; No . I think it 's actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_727	b	Well I 'll I 'll get another one before the end of the meeting . ; OK . ; Thank you . ; Yeah .
Bns001_565	ba	Ah we just discussed a lot about proxies . ; Oh , OK . ; That 's a fun ; I like them
Bro012_398	b	Word error rate . ; Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures , ; not ; Yeah .
Bro028_822	s	Right ? ; And then Um , people do this in image processing some . ; Mm - hmm . ; You have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever .
Bro008_331	%--	I mean , if you have ten digits for a phone number I mean , every now and then you 'll get it right . ; Sure . ; I mean , it 's it 's , uh , um ; So , I mean , the other thing is that , uh
Bro022_748	b	and then take the likely candidates and go further . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_286	bk	Maybe ten percent ? ; But I don't know if that 's really a fair way of comparing between , multi - party , conversations and two - party conversations . ; Then then then you have to ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1076	aa	but were were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission , ; or ? ; Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ? ; Yeah .
Bed011_713	%--	Yeah , um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component . ; or ? ; Oh ! ; So .
Bmr013_860	%--	And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the at that level , are sufficient . ; And maybe they don't need to be further broken down . ; And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . ; So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among
Bed013_1357	s	and , Eva can play around with the observed things , ; and we can run our better JavaBayes , and have it produce some output . ; And for the first time in th in in the world , we look at our output , ; and um and see uh whether it it 's any good .
Bro027_466	s	Ah . ; OK . ; Which now is based on , uh , cleaned features . ; And , it 's a l it 's a lot better .
Btr001_2638	aa	No , I totally agree . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I agree ,
Bmr027_1326	s	no big deal " . ; A hundred gig here , ; a hundred gig there . ; Well , each meeting is like a gig or something ,
Bmr006_947	s	What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? ; If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , ; Right , you can't analyse it . ; but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net .
Bed006_1033	s	Yeah ? ; So uh so we would we would instantiate the SPG schema with a Source - Path - Goal blah - blah - blah ; I see . ; and the buying event you know at which however that looks like , the place f thing to buy .
Bro023_888	b	I 'm trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get a negative . ; It means that at that particular frequency range you subtracted more energy than there was actually ; That means that ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_584	aa	Well , I don't know . ; What what do you , uh what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ? ; Cure the VAD ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_1435	s	So . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing .
Bro012_298	s	and I just uh f for most of the um ; For for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state . ; And so I just did a quick experiment , where I changed it so it went to four ; and um it it it didn't have a r any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases
Btr001_2721	aa	but some of the transcripts I 've seen they don't have any commas or breaks , ; it 's just a string of numbers . ; So we should be adding the breaks if ; Yes .
Bmr002_911	s	Yeah . ; This is the other think that um This is part of EAGLES , ; but um , ; but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this .
Bmr012_1305	s	And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John John Fiscus visit tomorrow . ; And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one ; that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes ; but to be basically in three parts ,
Bmr009_1548	aap	Right ? ; Yeah . ; So . ; We we could do that but that would mean changing the code .
Btr002_3446	bk	Sure . ; Oh . Right . ; I can go . ; OK .
Bed006_956	s	Mm - hmm . ; But this is a technical detail . ; So a pointer a way to really say pointers . ; Basically references from the roles in the schema the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha uh I 'm assuming .
Bmr024_1065	b	And the only thing that costs is the back - up issue , eh , to first order . ; Right . ; And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_954	b	unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . ; Right . ; In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , ; Right .
Bed010_153	b	So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . ; If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great . ; You should probably move the microphone closer to your face . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1109	b	No . The the SRI system does it . ; S R I system does that . Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Buw001_1750	s	different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . ; We 're gonna have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that . ; Yeah , we w ; Yeah . We never had our data format discussion .
Bed014_919	s	No , you Uh , people in this group connecting with with ; Those people who happen to be around . ; those people who who might not be around so much . ; Uh , I don't care .
Bed003_1447	s	Not direct . ; You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago . ; Mm - hmm . ; But uh it 's possible .
Bed003_1503	s	Mm - hmm . ; And there 's much more of them . ; Yeah , they 're Yeah , it 's way better ; yeah I used um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast
Btr001_1374	s	Right . ; There 's also some i iffiness about how d if ; Als ; We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it ,
Bro018_871	b	And um his uh the way that the S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly , ; uh and does all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr022_217	s	No , I just thi I don't know . If you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one , ; Sorry . ; and then ; That 's what I was saying . Is that that you could have each speaker could have their own tone .
Bro011_650	x	Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , ; but just sort of eh you know you t you i z ; Yeah . ; The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?
Bed015_1426	s	So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , " in France such - and - such happens " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible .
Bro022_361	s	i ; If , um ; Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum . ; So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .
Bmr002_635	d	a a is this ; So , we 're talking now , once you have words you know , how do you time align it . ; and that 's . ; Oh . So , these are p particularly for time alignment ?
Btr002_305	aa	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_100	s	which may be somewhere else . ; We say there 's another utterance . ; We don't know what the t time actually is ; but we know that it 's the same time as this end time .
Bmr016_1764	%--	Add what , Liz ? ; Yeah . ; it 's in the language model , ; w
Bed002_501	s	About intention , ; and that 's all they 're going to provide . ; And they don't give you the kind of object , ; they don't give you any discourse history ,
Bns003_749	aa	because , eh , students are not supposed to do research , eh , work until they have finished their gra their grade . ; Mm - hmm . ; You can change that . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_1642	bk	Well , we 'll definitely need to do both . ; No , ; I think the idea is to train on the , uh on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we 're gonna train to , ; Right .
Btr002_449	s	OK . ; th to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it 's occurring in . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , when I 'm clearing the par parentheses , I find that very useful .
Bro023_629	s	in yeah , after the speech starts . ; Uh - huh . ; So ; but that 's not the case in , uh , many many of our cases
Bro027_1735	b	So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is , ; and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize . ; Uh , I mean , you 'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2090	no	No . ; Just to check . ; Yeah . W we should know what 's out there certainly . ; I I don't know .
Bro026_1001	s	Right . ; Right . ; And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories ; I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments
Bed014_745	aa	I have the , uh If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there . ; Good . ; OK . Well , this this is highly relevant to someone 's thesis . ; Yes ,
Btr002_467	s	Yes . ; is , uh is much more common . ; Is that what it 's about ? ; I wasn't I couldn't u I don't know , for some reason that didn't make sense to me .
Bed003_594	h	And the time of day is night ? ; Yeah , ; no ; wait .
Bed003_251	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Whether the destination was their final destination , ; whether the destination was closed . ; Those are all
Bns002_1421	s	uh , I assume was not read yesterday night . ; So I suggest we go roughly to the slides here ; and um ; The the problem is that , in principle , we have different scopes .
Bmr006_482	bk	That 's a very good point . ; We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . ; So we can so we can ; r Right .
Bro017_905	%--	yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But if your
Bmr024_188	b	Yes . ; Because , uh , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it . ; We we didn't cut those out . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_793	s	that 's not perfect , but ; um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , ; if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , ; Right , we discussed that .
Bro005_695	%--	OK . ; Ah , yes . ; Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , ; I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the
Bns001_1806	cc	cake area . ; At this number ? ; and ; now let me see whether he will be here ,
Btr002_2595	s	That 's interesting . ; That 's interesting . ; I ran across a couple " ho " 's occ ; It was just that one spot .
Bmr022_1073	s	but w but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it , just letting them log in to ICSI might be OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control . ; And the audio files , it 's not worth doing
Bsr001_1593	s	Uh yes , ; OK , OK , OK . ; Mmm . ; but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent .
Bmr016_709	bk	but using um , you know , more than energy ; I I don't know what exactly would go into it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , sure .
Bro018_156	b	This is f ; You have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_225	%--	Yeah . ; Catal - uh Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters . ; I I I I mean the the the scatter plot combining eh different n two combination . ; Yeah , but but what she 's saying is , which is right , is le
Bro023_278	b	OK . ; um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro019_245	s	um ; Like , for example , uh if you didn't wanna write a P - make script ; and you just had a , uh an HTK training job that you know is gonna take uh , six hours to run , ; and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use ,
Bed015_1225	s	uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . ; So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . ; Mm - hmm . ; So by default it 'll be like " true " , I guess ,
Bmr028_1031	2	Yeah . ; and ; But , say , if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace , then sitting there , then it would Its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him , and so on . ; And transfer functions .
Bns001_226	s	and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway . ; So I would like to to uh split , in principle , the discussions of what kind of application tsk um f far away ; and I would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t concerning these building blocks and the network , Um , What kind of problem we are going to solve . ; What kind of , uh , um , um , glue between these four building blocks exists
Bro004_1273	g	It would do badly ; and it didn't so badly , ; Yeah , right . ; right ?
Bmr005_665	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; And and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,
Bmr021_621	s	Really enjoy that . ; With no with no advance warning . ; Y you ; Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record .
Bsr001_1866	%--	There we go . ; Right , right . ; Um , ; bu but how much how valuable
Bmr024_886	aa	Yeah . ; The the th ; But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ? ; Yep .
Bmr006_116	b	but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . ; Yeah , I definitely agree with that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1144	s	Yeah . ; but it 's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of " OK they really want to know if there 's a bakery around here " ,
Bmr016_870	b	OK . ; Well I 'd leave all the All the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up , ; So we wanna put ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_210	s	Is that a possibility for that ? ; Ye - uh Yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a CallHome and a CallFriend also , ; The CallFriend is for language ind identification . ; Well , anyway , these corpus are all telephone speech .
Bmr016_2012	aa	Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? ; This is more because ; Or ; Yeah .
Bro005_947	b	s Right . So Yeah , the training targets actually , ; the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency and the noise dependency . ; And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_863	s	Right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh so you stop at that point . ; And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops .
Bro005_551	fa	And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . ; Mmm . ; And , um , so this is just setting them to be , ; excuse me ,
Bmr027_1512	ba	But , I mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody ; sort of a different crowd , ; and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , ; so that should be interesting .
Bro003_427	s	Oh , my turn . ; Oh , OK . ; Um , Let 's see , I I spent the last week , uh , looking over Stephane 's shoulder . And and understanding some of the data . ; I re - installed , um , um , HTK , the free version ,
Btr002_3102	s	I it was a long time ago . ; I do remember that . Yeah . ; Yeah , and I was like , " Oah ! " ; I emailed you ,
Bro013_129	s	Oh . ; I uh but I 'm I 'm almost certain that it it I mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . ; It ; It it 's it 's orders of magnitude off .
Bns002_885	b	Uh , do you assume that power control will be issue also in the next years ? ; In other words , um is the um success of having more power within the devices in maybe three year , four years , five years , for batteries , and and and @ @ and sofort so on ; uh will it be succeeded that you have so much power available that this difficult mechanism who is in the wireless network will be uh out of scope ? ; Mmm .
Bed015_106	b	sort of skipping fonts and whatever . ; The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . ; It 's it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1228	b	Yeah , it 's not ; But I mean if you just replaced it with silence , it 's not clear whether that 's really silence or ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1189	s	Right . ; just ; So ; At least a couple thousand hidden units .
Bro018_13	bk	No , satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum , ; the new base system the new base system . ; Oh the ; OK ,
Bro012_913	s	For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition . ; Yeah . So basically you want to reduce this effect . ; Well , y ; So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection .
Bro017_1263	b	He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when , ; and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1417	2	Yeah . ; Um , ; I guess Ericsson is on the , um , filter bank , ; FFT . Filter bank ,
Bro007_32	s	So ; Yeah . ; Three , OK . ; The first is a KLT using several frames of the features .
Bmr031_1530	s	And the third is just , um , taking a slope , um , of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that . ; So , those are the three three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers . ; And , um , ; hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff
Bro022_1141	%--	So so , in i i ; and ; Not ; and C - zero would be a different
Bed008_1116	ba	but it 's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down . or learn . ; Right , true . ; Uh but , you know it 's four to the fourth . ; It 's pretty big .
Bmr003_1462	b	And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , there were two people speaking during part of it ; Yeah . ; and if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_487	b	the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , ; yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro027_262	s	Oh , eh , great . ; No problems . ; And , um , I grabbed the sample stuff ; but I haven't , uh , compiled it .
Bmr022_299	bk	Maybe I should write to Brian and tell him what the problem was ; So what ; and what our proposed solutions are . ; Right .
Bmr024_393	qh	Well , I I I dunno , ; I I think that that 's if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , uh , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff . ; Right . ; So , why not ?
Bed017_592	b	Um , ; and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care , ; but it just I 'm a little surprised that uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send . ; Alright .
Bro025_220	b	but but but uh , to orthogonalize them ; but but they were not , uh , processed through a neural net . ; And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_235	%--	Maybe maybe maybe a bit for the AI i intuition thing . ; Will it work again , ; Yeah . ; or ?
Bed003_1799	s	So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday . ; And uh nothing has changed since then , ; so . ; Uh . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this ,
Bro021_579	b	So , um , you can scale it down by ; I 'm sorry , ; it was two , three weeks for training up for the large Broadcast News test set training set . ; Oh .
Bed002_58	s	So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . ; And the short form ; I mean , you should read the consent form , ; but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts .
Bmr009_468	%--	Yeah . ; So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy . ; But all the other cases might . ; and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s in terms of their words or
Bmr022_1258	qw	So the problem with RCS is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't , ; Yeah . ; because the granularity of locking is at the file level . ; What - what does CVS do if they if they do overlap ?
Bmr019_666	s	I don't know , ; did you wanna talk about it , ; or ? ; I can give a I was just telling this to Jane
Bro011_302	aa	it was you I was ; Yeah . ; and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . ; Yeah .
Bed008_931	b	I guess the final ; maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision uh to the Go - there node . ; And I don't worry about layout , ; Yeah .
Btr002_3120	b	Yeah . ; I can understand . ; Hmm ! ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_402	bk	I 'm not sure how many frames you need . ; But you take that many from the front and flip it around to a as the negative value . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah ,
Bns002_274	s	and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control . ; And , uh , ; well , some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions ; and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism .
Bmr001_32	%	OK . ; Yep . ; OK . ; This is
Bmr026_1104	b	No . ; Really ? ; They were very close . ; Yeah .
Bed010_356	s	I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag ; Yep . ; Right . ; JavaBayes does not support that .
Bro017_593	b	but ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's not , yeah , finished yet . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_269	%--	I mean , file lengths are , I guess the same order or in the same size as for test data , or ; aren't they ? ; OK . ; But it 's
Bro026_559	fa	Have you ever ? ; Very good question . ; Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ? ; Sorry .
Bro027_1071	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; From zero to clean . ; Yeah .
Bed002_271	s	Uh , I didn't look through all the data . ; um , and there there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people uh , the ways people phrase how to g get if they want to get to a certain place . ; And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious ; Um . Maybe I should go back a couple of steps
Bro027_1230	s	Yeah , actually to s eh , what I observed in the HM case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . ; It it doubles . ; Number of deletions . ; When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions .
Bro019_1209	bk	And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have . ; And um . ; So , ; when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking " oh , OK ,
Bmr008_685	b	It 's a good idea . ; Depends of who you ask , what the age range is . ; Well , in the home , the influence of the home is much lower age than that , ; Yeah .
Bed003_204	aa	Yeah . ; Right . ; OK . ; Right .
Bmr028_1283	%--	Well , I mean , what happens if you break one segment into two ? ; You never know . ; Suddenly the don they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore . ; No , but that 's what the pr
Bmr002_408	ba	Um There 's a little program that downloads into it . ; Um . ; Hmm . ; This is great .
Bmr001_556	b	Well , it 's OK , ; it 's only the first try . ; I what I 'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel . ; Right .
Bed014_694	aa	and and ; So , if the issue is , if so now th this construction has been matched and you say " OK . Does this actually have any implications for our decisions ? " Then there 's another piece of code that presumably does that computation . ; So , sort of forward chaining in a way , rather than backward . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Btr001_185	s	Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting . ; I mean , ; um , ; I forget who it was that I was transcribing
Bmr002_1370	s	We have five of the wireless . ; Oh , OK . ; OK . ; And then we were going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well .
Bmr011_1320	s	and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before ; but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , " well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow ; Yeah . ; and try to convince people " .
Bmr002_1145	s	Big ears . ; Right . ; Right . ; But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table .
Bns001_1758	%--	RSVP . ; and I think we should stop now but please everybody , ; short ; eh s
Bsr001_2000	b	that 's right . ; Mmm . ; I mean , just just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_352	%--	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , but , you know , I uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem , ; I mean .
Bmr008_408	no	Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says " optional " they might not . ; Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years . ; Anyway , it 's fine ; I don't know .
Bro017_397	s	Ah . ; like because uh uh ; Latency and things . ; latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing ,
Bdb001_218	s	so that external file wouldn't be in ; So that might that might work . ; But what what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ? ; More compact ,
Btr002_321	%--	Yeah . ; Right . ; And then especially if you 've got a pause following it , ; but you don't always y
Bmr001_432	s	Yeah . ; OK , that is a bit more than I thought . ; How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space ; cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory .
Bmr030_387	s	S ; Yeah , th Right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM , ; part ; There 's there 's several problems .
Bmr006_1006	s	Um So . ; Yeah . ; Can I ask ? ; It strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition .
Bro023_1479	bk	But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t ; Well , that 's that 's using the channel zero . ; If I use a channel zero VAD to estimate the noise . ; Oh , OK .
Bns002_418	bk	Yeah ? ; And that 's what I mean . ; In the meantime , he c still can get some data here , where he try to get certain connectivity on the MAC layer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1105	b	Right ? ; And it could be , like like these , um these auditory patterns that Michael is looking at . ; And then when you 're looking at the the , uh , um , the best features , you know , you can take out you can do the do this , uh , brain surgery by taking out , um , hidden units that don't really help at all . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_625	b	The top one is done . I c ; I can re - do the next one . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1672	s	Yeah , we 'll have to look at it you know . ; Yeah . ; Anyway . ; I actually explicitly looked for that one ,
Bed003_675	s	but I 'd like to see more . ; Not because it would expedite the probabilities , cuz it wouldn't . ; It would actually slow that down tremendously . ; Um . Well , yeah ,
Bmr020_1869	b	Yeah , ; As I say , we 'll just have to listen to it and see how horrible it is . ; Yeah , e ; yeah .
Bmr013_159	no	Right . ; so it 's gonna be different . ; do we do on TI - digits ? ; I don't remember .
Buw001_286	s	Actually ; Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . ; And so ; And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval
Bmr012_814	s	Right . ; I mean I guess there 's some ; So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences . ; You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .
Buw001_1680	qw	and ; Yeah , foot foot pedals ; and ; Uh , so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ?
Bro003_515	%--	Well , especially when you go over the different languages again , ; because you 'd the different languages have different words for the different digits , ; Mm - hmm . ; And I was
Bro012_1490	aa	which ; That model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits , ; right ? ; Right .
Bns003_647	bk	Right now I 'm interested and I 'm looking into it ; and I 'm working started yesterday , actually working on it , ; to do the , uh u to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark , um , on an open - source router that 's different from the one that of Mark 's project . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_171	b	and Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that . ; Yeah , it is . ; Yeah . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bro010_1039	b	like frication , ; Mm - hmm . ; abrupt closure , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_859	s	Well , uh , some people is also proposing different things , different eh algorithms with different results . ; So , in fact , there are a lot of good ; I just was trying to present a you know the main ideas . ; So , I I I you know , ask uh You Feel free to ask uh whatever you want ,
Bro005_889	s	because all our nets are trained on the same noises ; and ; I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . ; So it And that has other noise .
Buw001_1821	b	Um , anyway ; I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up . ; My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it ; Mmm .
Bed016_823	%--	Yeah , so so nob so no one has in in of the , ; uh , ; professional linguists , ; they haven't
Bmr027_1032	s	S ; You know , she was uncertain about that . ; OK . ; So she 's right to be uncertain .
Btr002_1610	s	Cuz it could ; It 's yeah , it seems to be more at the end . ; The the person ; Eah . Depends on the person .
Bmr027_1198	co	I think I have a pair that I brought from home , ; We have ; but it 's f just for music listening ; No . Just just just just buy them .
Bed006_284	s	Hopefully . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ? ; Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map .
Bro003_428	s	Oh , OK . ; Um , Let 's see , I I spent the last week , uh , looking over Stephane 's shoulder . And and understanding some of the data . ; I re - installed , um , um , HTK , the free version , ; so , um , everybody 's now using three point O ,
Bmr001_392	s	It was more than that . ; For for all the channels ? ; Was that with or without the ; I thought it was one gigabyte .
Bmr021_440	b	Well , assuming you 'd Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original Switchboard files . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Mmm .
Bdb001_844	%	so that , uh , you could define a single API and the the storage could be flat XML files or a database . ; Mm - hmm . ; My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough . ; But
Bmr015_461	s	So . Um . But , um . ; So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now , ; or none of us are funded for , ; so it 's so it 's it would be new .
Bro016_668	b	and ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I think , eh , if I recall correctly , they did something like that . ; Hmm .
Bro024_1910	aa	Maybe you you are leaving in in about two weeks Carmen . ; OK . ; No ? ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1209	bk	Yes ! ; Oh , after . ; Yes ! ; Oh , OK ,
Bro027_1846	bk	the VAD has a ; Ah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed008_819	s	Mm - hmm . ; and so ; I I don't yet know how to do this , ; I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties
Bro017_1160	s	Mm - hmm . ; I think you can show that uh uh analytically . ; Hmm . ; So typically what happens is that you you need to weight the uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients .
Bmr018_1537	b	Are irrelevant . ; are irrelevant ; once you get a real recognizer at the back - end . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2773	b	Yeah ! Yeah . ; Cuz then you 'll hear you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one level , ; but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then " missing segment " . ; Yeah .
Bed011_961	s	OK . ; Dialogues . SmartKom ; OK . ; SmartKom Human .
Bmr006_1183	b	I mean , is is that violation of the ; Oh . ; No . ; Yeah .
Bro025_66	%--	Um , and we ; So what 's what 's happened ? ; I think I 've missed something . ; OK . So a week ago
Bmr025_314	s	Um ; My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . ; Right ? ; The Windows system isn't any harder
Bmr011_936	aa	Yeah . ; Uh , it 's pretty hard to follow , especially ; One side . ; I agree .
Bmr009_1452	s	OK . ; And it 's easy on the subjects . ; Yep . ; Now I have one suggestion on the next section .
Bmr009_409	b	but But this will ; Yeah , no . I didn't mean that that for you to do that , ; but I was thinking if if Don and I are trying to get categories ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_389	bk	Right ? ; Well , it 's it sounds I mean , we have to be careful , ; cuz we haven't gotten a good result yet . ; Yeah .
Bro003_2023	s	to see if that data helps . ; Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature . ; And because they had done some cheating experiments ; This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus .
Bns001_691	s	because GSM networks were developed to y uh with a voice service in mind . ; Ah , delay is also considered in these networks . ; So , ; uh , in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter , and a a a specified um data speed .
Bmr013_838	%	Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . ; So this , blends nicely into the update on transcripts . ; Yes , it does . ; OK .
Bmr026_1222	b	Oh I see , ; I see , ; yeah , of course . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1428	b	Which is part of why it 's used . ; to the wr to the wrong audience , I think that that might be t a negative shock . ; Yeah . I thi I think to the wrong audience , I agree that , um , p ; Uh - huh .
Bmr007_31	%--	OK ; Testing , one , two , three . ; Um Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go , ; and
Bro004_1198	%--	Ah , thank you . ; Temporal LDA . ; Yeah , you would know that . ; Yeah
Bmr001_446	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have we um ; If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1334	no	And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around ; and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . ; But that that 's gonna be very hard to generate . ; So , I don't I don't know .
Bmr029_78	%--	And and and Dave has been working with that and there 's all of those issues . ; But I know that if I go in with something that 's not just digits it would be good . ; And , um , so ; We already have these results that you
Bed005_1087	s	So we come up with these l little tables for each of those ; OK . ; And the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these , ; so we don't need to specify any probabilities .
Bro015_152	co	Yeah . ; So , I guess . Yeah , we m ; OK . ; Well , uh . Let 's let 's come back to this uh later .
Bmr028_1069	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So , um ; Hmm .
Bed008_1523	bk	OK . ; OK . ; Fey , you mean . ; OK .
Bmr016_1226	b	so you always replace it . ; Exactly . ; If that 's how what you wanna do . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_566	%--	but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . ; For example about , you know prosodic information ; and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . ; Um so that 'll be something that
Buw001_9	s	Well , I don't think ; No . ; No , uh , that that wasn't recorded . ; Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears .
Bed010_553	bk	It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at . ; OK .
Btr002_257	s	I think the second one where the " so " is all by itself , it 's like , " So that would be a problem . So . " ; You know , the " so " is like disconnected from the ; Some ; Right , as though it 's leading into something else .
Bmr027_306	b	That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts ; Oh , OK . ; and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general uh , larger audience . ; Hmm .
Bro019_1337	s	It was about finding the higher - order moments of ; Yeah , ; Yeah . ; cumulants ,
Bmr010_1323	s	and ; and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap . ; Hmm . ; And let the , uh , uh , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data .
Bro025_104	%--	And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , ; um , that arguably , you 're c
Bmr009_163	b	Well , actually , you do have some distributions here , uh for these cases . ; Yeah . ; You have some histograms , ; Yeah .
Bns002_534	b	Yeah . ; It 's always true that only one node gets a media access , for one frame . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_358	aa	So it 's the network trained it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units , ; and um nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs . ; This is the one they had originally ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_887	%--	Yeah . ; Well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization ; and that 's what uh we 've already observed . ; But uh ,
Bed006_501	s	Isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that ? ; Finals was that . ; Yeah w it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students ; but final projects might .
Bro010_821	%--	to test whether um , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . ; And then , um , it c it 's combined by a soft AND gate . ; And at the at the higher level , ; for every if ,
Bro019_956	2	Who is doing this ? ; Uh w working in the cepstral domain ? ; So there is one guy in Grenada , ; Yeah , in Grenada
Bed011_523	b	and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago . ; That means that one hundred people have to be interested . ; Good luck . ; Yeah .
Bed010_255	b	you know what do the constructions look like , ; what 's the execution engine look like , ; mmm lots of things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1257	s	uh , ; It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA , ; and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test , ; so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things ,
Bmr006_1063	t1	Right ? ; So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in in in in ; Yeah . ; Features ?
Btr001_2230	ba	Mmm . ; That 's true . ; But . ; I thought that was really interesting .
Bns002_1063	b	Yeah . ; even if it 's not the direct neighbor , ; but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through , put it in the I P header . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_465	%--	So then landmark is ; Oh , ; sorry . ; " Verb used " is like ,
Bmr008_928	s	Right . ; So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , Region , and Variety of English . ; And that 's it . ; Because it used to be that Germans would learn British English , and now I think there 's , you know , is a certain percentage of them who who 've @ @ to tend toward American English .
Btr001_2193	co	Right . ; or j d expound on it . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it 's sort of a like you guys can take from here ,
Bro017_253	%--	Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector . ; And you can try to classify based on that . ; Hmm . ; And you so you classi
Bmr024_1485	%--	Well , mis for making things better . ; Yeah . ; But , this for making things worse . ; This it migh
Bed010_426	cc	I mean , yeah , ; I can like I c ; Um . This week I guess um , kind of I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . ; So yes , I might I can be around .
Btr002_3085	ar	Yeah . ; Not the swearword version . ; Hmm ; No , no , no , no , no , no ,
Btr002_604	b	Good . ; That , uh , I mean , you know , one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have , ; but we 've got good microphones ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_597	ba	Um , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then ; Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . To push it along . ; See the problem is it it took , uh , uh , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . ; And it was a really big deal .
Bmr028_192	b	Uh , no . ; But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then . ; But d y ; Right .
Bro019_1473	%--	Thirty - first . ; Yeah , ; well if there 's a house available or place to ; Well , I mean i i if if
Bed005_169	%--	And ; S ; Yeah . We ar we can sh er I can show you the templates . ; The former end g "
Bro021_901	%--	you just mean the log of the of the one up above . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , so that is X times ,
Bmr007_735	b	It would be a research task . ; Having having ground tu truth would be nice , so seat number would be good . ; You know where you could get it ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Btr002_1305	b	I mean , I I like that interface . ; Very efficient , ; and really is , um I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_140	bk	That 's I think what we and I agree with . ; Oh , interesting ! ; Yeah . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr002_922	ar	Now , so , are we talking about the stage of uh simply the word stage ? ; or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment as well ? ; No , we 're not going to do time alignment . ; No .
Bmr012_1141	s	A hand - held , ; yeah . ; that 's a good idea ; Infinite expansion .
Bmr023_826	bk	Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ? ; Good . ; Exactly . Yeah . ; OK .
Bed008_625	bk	Well ; somebody else has built this user model . ; Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus ; Oh I see ,
Bmr006_1366	s	Then they 're much broader . ; Yeah , we can do whatever we want . ; Yeah . ; But but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA .
Bro027_1657	s	Uh . ; but just like just to know that everything is fine . ; Uh - huh . ; So it was like , uh , forty - five cepstrum plus twenty - three mel log mel .
Bmr025_513	aa	I think it 's Edit - key , command ; Edit - key . ; Did I show you guys that ? ; Yep .
Btr002_2783	%	Hmm . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns002_390	s	l let me ; So , maybe my idea first . ; So this is what , node one ? ; This is node two
Bmr003_2039	%--	Clink ! ; But this was the uh just just to review , ; and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around . ; And and crinkle them and
Btr001_1589	b	And time bins , ; yeah . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro008_577	aa	Oh , yeah , digits . ; Oh yeah , digits ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_528	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this transmission won't take place .
Bmr024_1298	%--	What 's Are the freq ? ; you know , if that 's also different or in the same direction or not . ; You 're This is lemme ask a q more basic que ; Cuz
Bmr012_973	ba	or you could even write down " oh it 's about three twenty five and " ; Well what I was just suggesting is is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose ; Yeah , and use that . ; Not a bad idea .
Bmr009_1428	qw	Is that a real accent ? ; Sure , yeah ! ; Yeah . ; How do you spell it ?
Bmr020_1338	b	Yeah . ; The other one is we just run his thing and send it to IBM . ; There 's a a another possibility if we find that there are some problems , ; Yeah .
Bro010_910	s	I mean , one is the going towards , um , using narrow band information for , uh , ph phonetic features of some sort ; rather than just , uh , immediately going for the the typical sound units . ; Right . ; Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule ,
Bed006_1731	b	I mean w what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely , ; you know , and leave it up for us to get the parser input um ; Mmm . We know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of RAD . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1380	s	So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gonna do small project associated to this . ; What I 'm gonna try to do is uh use use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . ; To try to do something about that . ; So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation ,
Bmr031_60	b	so . ; And Chuck gets stuck with the ear - plug mike . ; OK . Last guy in gets the ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1194	s	Um . But , uh , ; you know , they both help each other . ; If you have a if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner . ; If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in in taking less time to correct things .
Bmr001_534	h	Yeah , so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way ; do we ? ; So these large sections when you guys aren't talking ; Yeah .
Bmr014_25	bk	Any agenda items today ? ; I wanna talk a little bit about getting how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps , parts of the meeting that they don't want to include . ; What I 've done so far , and I wanna get some opinions on , how to how to finish it up . ; OK .
Bmr010_1197	%	If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in in taking less time to correct things . ; So so ; OK . ; Excellent .
Buw001_2244	%--	For the moment . ; Pass . ; I think I think " pass " is socially acceptable . ; But I will say uh , I will actually
Btr001_299	%--	Oh , that 's fascinating . ; Huh . ; I find it one of one of the hardest ones to transcribe . ; Well , what you can see is that it 's it 's her lack of of English fluency that 's being
Bro017_57	%--	And in principle I uh I we agreed . ; Mm - hmm . ; We said uh " yeah " . ; Because uh
Bmr020_1324	%	Oh , ; the dead meetings . ; Yeah , ; get
Bro007_22	b	yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1296	s	Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing . ; And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently , ; Mmm . ; that , you know , we 're not we won't be contributing that much .
Bmr019_324	s	and now they 're all blurring . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . ; And then others were connected digits .
Bro010_7	h	Do you have news from the conference talk ? ; Uh , ; that was programmed for yesterday I guess . ; Uh
Bmr003_1024	%--	For thirty dollars an hour for of their work . ; OK . ; OK . ; Oh , of their
Bmr028_1682	s	But is it better than nothing ? ; Yeah , probably . ; Cuz it would really be ; I mean , this is the reason why I haven't gotten back to it , is cuz my first pass at it didn't really work
Bmr024_1546	s	Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , ; but there 's something going wrong ; and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , ; and I 'm not sure why .
Bed011_577	d	So all tours b a tour happens only within one day ? ; Yes . ; OK . ; So the next tour will be tomorrow ?
Bmr016_277	s	I thought so . ; Was it read ? ; Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI . ; Oh , I may well be .
Bmr015_55	%--	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Oh , great . ; Uh , ; and then , you have
Bro022_978	%--	Well . ; Mmm . ; Well , it until now , it doesn't seem to help . ; But
Bmr023_399	s	I talked to Helen . ; And and and she was ; And so , I asked her ; I mean , They 're very perceptive .
Btr002_224	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance . ; Like it 's not connected .
Bed002_544	s	Mm - hmm . ; you know ? ; somebody else has to do that job later . ; I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output ,
Bmr005_1443	s	Yeah . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition
Bmr013_639	b	Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea . ; OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_760	2	almost all the vowels , ; that 's the hard part . ; So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms , ; And a few of the consonants .
Bed006_1111	s	right ? ; Well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing ; because uh I mean many actions presuppose some um almost infinitely many other actions . ; So if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry .
Bro022_762	b	uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically . ; I i Just to clarify something for me . ; I ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_109	ba	No promises . ; No promises . ; No . ; Ah , he 's very hard to sell .
Bro028_892	b	So that that seemed , you know , different . ; We 're sort of curious about , uh , what are some things that are , u u um , @ @ conceptually quite different from what we 've done . ; Cuz we you know , one thing that w that , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_440	%--	So . ; I mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variables ; and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there , ; but I I 'm not sure
Bmr008_759	b	I mean most of the people from cer certain places in the South were from specific Texas locations , ; but other than that you had a huge range of ; You know , people would say Boston , and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_924	%--	Uh , yeah . ; right ? ; Right . ; The s
Btr002_2639	b	That 's that 's what I prefer . ; Mmm . ; Um , so cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_230	s	Yeah , but I mean it 's not just that , it 's also you know you ; Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w ; Yeah . ; It 's also like n no breathing ,
Btr001_1718	s	I usually take out ; um , I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they 're laughs . ; I usually don't transcribe the the inbreaths or things like that . ; I don't either .
Bro003_1261	%--	So , it 's got to take that sort of thing , ; or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these . ; Yeah . ; So this is
Bed017_718	s	this was his only example , ; " if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , ; and as compelling as a video game , ; then that would have a huge social impact " .
Bmr016_1068	s	If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive ; and make it all scratch space . ; You know , it 's not a big deal . ; You 're right about the backup being a bottleneck .
Bmr018_1052	aa	Yeah . ; Oh , not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel , ; Right . ; Right .
Bdb001_555	s	things like that . ; Um , ; and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone - level . ; If if it can handle that , it could handle states or whatever .
Bed006_56	s	Not yet . ; ha - ha . ; " One of us . " ; but um it 's too late for him now .
Btr001_1308	no	OK ; Which are What are the two differences ? ; I 'm not sure . ; I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one .
Bro014_936	b	where you 're really just i i ; the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_229	s	Actually you know I should check ; because he did port it to SPRACHcore ; Right . ; so he might have done that already .
Bed008_1186	s	you no , ; I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface ; but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time uh all the things that you pick up , ; you click on " endpoint " ,
Bmr003_1730	s	Mmm . ; and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , to indicate that it was continuation ; but it wasn't ; Oh , I guess I did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things
Bmr027_1440	fa	And this week we were gonna try to do t automatic transcription status . ; I wasn't here last week . ; Oh ! ; Sorry .
Bed003_1801	%--	so . ; Uh . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this , ; and especially since um Johno can't stop Tango - ing , we may actually include , you know , those those intentions . ; So now I think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh
Bmr003_1965	s	And it ; Which produces also site maps . ; it 's - it it 's very powerful . ; Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to .
Bmr016_1941	aa	I may change it to " digits " . ; I mean , i with the sed command you can really just change it however you want ; because it 's systematically encoded , you know ? ; Yep .
Bed015_1450	bk	S Swede ? ; uh , he is Dutch ; Dutch ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_1076	%--	that 's a , uh ; Right . But . ; There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions ; I don't like uh
Bmr022_1228	s	Mm - hmm . ; or they all don't . ; But it 's sort of ; And if they all do , then there isn't a problem ,
Bmr022_1008	2	You 're saying there 's a mike that plugs in to the IRAM board ? ; No , no , what I 'm saying is that we 're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure , d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot , ; or ; Demo .
Bmr007_885	s	Right . ; in in that , eh eh speech file is , eh more similar . ; Right . ; between the different eh , speaker , um I I think is eh , it will i is my opinion .
Bro016_604	bk	Maybe having something along the ; I mean , you can't really do vocal tract normalization . ; But something that had some of that effect ; Yeah .
Bed016_1122	t3	Yeah . ; Hardly anything . ; So not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant . ; I have to go .
Bmr028_891	b	Right . ; It might might only be that it goes from forty percent to eighty , or something like that . ; Yeah , eighty percent . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_572	s	and then , we found we were at six pages , ; and then we started cutting furiously ; Oops . ; and threw out half of the material again ,
Btr002_2674	ba	Yeah . ; Mmm . OK . ; Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's not clear . ; That 's good .
Bmr002_900	ba	I could ask my contacts at the LDC what what it is they actually use . ; Oh ! ; I mean , I know , I mean I 've got I 've got contacts up there , ; Good idea .
Bmr018_904	b	So so whether the corrections take too much time . ; That 's right . ; I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1267	s	And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test . ; Yeah . ; And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test , ; and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test ,
Bed015_987	s	Japanese has this though . ; Topic marker ? ; You know . ; Yeah , that 's what " wa " is ,
Bsr001_2079	%--	I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm I 'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project ; They 're not hard ; but ; but SRI in general is is the
Bed004_497	s	So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us , ; um ; And a very simple thing . ; We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .
Bmr022_350	%--	That 'll work . ; So , inst replacing the beep with " twenty - three " , ; " twenty - four " , ; " twenty - five "
Bmr002_1180	b	Right . ; Um . ; So these are near near field ? ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_314	b	Yeah . ; And , you can also have notes of the meeting . ; But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1090	b	And for those type of tasks , it wou it 's much more efficient to present , uh , the th p present a bunch of , uh , clickable buttons or whatever ; Dialogue . Yeah . ; Buttons . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_1190	%--	Well . ; You you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra . ; Right ? ; I mean , you can just sort of normalize the
Bed015_1386	b	which just tells you how various what schemas you 're using ; and they 're how they 're bound together . ; And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1455	bk	but but ; Exactly . ; So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel recordings . ; Ah .
Bro028_352	t1	which , ; um , uh ; Mmm . ; Uh , so , let 's see ,
Bro003_912	s	So . OK , so that 's your training corpus , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then your testing corpus ? ; Um , the testing corporas are , um , just , um , the same ones as Aurora testing .
Bro027_1801	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm . ; it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability .
Bmr028_1484	qo	I didn't know that . ; Huh ! ; In ; In the multi - band experiments , in the first one , we really wanted to find out , " what if you knew which band was really noisy ? "
Btr001_1765	no	Right , ; but like ; it 's it 's not a very committed laugh , ; I don't know how you do it ,
Bmr028_1738	s	And we have so many . ; I guess there is no ; You could put them at the back of the queue or something . ; Well , I I I think we can't throw away that data ,
Bmr006_833	b	the first ; We 're just ; We just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing . ; Yeah .
Bed009_368	aa	yeah . ; So we ha we have to get in on that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bro014_263	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , this seems like an obvious mistake or something . ; Th - they 're ; Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake .
Bed011_865	bk	Anyway , we 'll sort th yeah , we 'll sort that out . ; I I ; OK . ; Right .
Bns002_1369	s	because I bring it up , uh concerning the proposal , some kind of active routing mechanism . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's going in a quite different direction as as as as the traditional things discussed in the ITF ; and I currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic uh , within the I T
Bed017_248	s	So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert ; i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , ; that a travel planner should be able to take it from there . ; And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever ,
Bmr013_885	%--	Um , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , uh , mouth noise , or , cough . ; And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up ; which I hadn't thought about before ; but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like ,
Buw001_1879	s	Hmm . ; Yeah , that was uh , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , uh , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . ; Well , that 's the idea . ; So that that that would be a source of text which is supposedly got the right vocabulary .
Btr002_2162	b	Yep . Mhh . ; And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on , personally . ; Mmm , well , mm - hmm , mm - hmm that 's right , ; Uh - huh .
Bsr001_1614	bs	Right . ; Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly ; and makes sense how to do . ; So a fairly simple back - end .
Bro024_1453	bk	So this ; s ; So by uh , by by reducing the noise a a decent threshold like minus thirty DB , it 's like Uh , you are like r r reducing the floor of the noisy regions , right ? ; Yeah .
Bns003_414	bk	Yes , ; Uh , yes , ; eh But ; I see there your point .
Bmr009_1203	%--	style . ; Well . Depends who you ask , I suppose . ; W I guess that 's the problem with these categories . ; But that 's why they have New York City but
Btr002_1017	s	Oh . ; How do you get per I don't know the evil apostrophe . ; It 's just th right above the backspace . ; Um , yeah , it 's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to .
Bmr031_1101	s	Mm - hmm . ; So so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it , ; but you can't actually encode , um encode someth ; Yeah . I un I understand the problem .
Bro028_582	%--	So . ; This is for the training ? ; But their s ; Uh I beli
Bdb001_934	%--	Sure . ; I mean , I think we 're sort of guinea pigs , ; cuz I I want to get the prosody work done ; but I don't want to waste time , you know , getting the
Bmr026_617	s	and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here ; but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . ; And I I I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , ; so something that we wanna do next meeting is is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done .
Bdb001_456	2	So each type tag has only particular items that it can take . ; Can you But you can add to those structures if you ; Sure . ; If you have more information .
Bmr031_485	%--	Yeah . ; Depends what you save . ; um , ; i
Bmr024_1634	bk	not between ; And , uh , since we 're in a hurry , we were just gonna read everyone all at once . ; So , if you sorta plug your ears and read ; OK .
Bro024_102	d	And which was worse ? ; The train on twelve seconds . ; OK . ; But point three percent , uh , w from what to what ?
Bmr002_1133	aa	Oh ! ; Yeah , cuz you 'd get you get ; you get a certain amount of spatial information . ; Right !
Bed006_211	cc	or something ; so . ; As a matter of fact , if you ; I can send it .
Bro028_1021	g	Um , ; I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different ; but , um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints . ; So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ?
Bmr011_1089	s	uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , ; Right . ; which segment they belonged to . ; So that 's sort of what I 'm worried about right now .
Bmr030_300	x	It 's kind of a useless one . ; and I 'm wondering what criteria they use . ; Yeah , I actually don't know off the top of my head . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1924	s	Why ? ; What what 's what 's the issue ? ; Well , we could put we could put sort of a disorganized sort of group gestalt ; No one owns the project .
Bmr022_423	%--	OK . ; Or just ; Othe - other than lengthening the transcript , I think it would be very helpful . ; Just instead of the sequential number , for
Btr001_1774	s	yeah , it 's like . ; It 's like ; Yeah . ; yeah , " I guess I 'll laugh cuz everyone else is laughing , "
Bro003_966	s	I 'm just kidding . ; when when I put these testings on there , I 'm assumi ; Yeah . ; There - there 's three three tests .
Bro016_306	s	As for these other things , it may turn out that , uh , it 's kind of reasonable . ; But then ; I mean , Andreas gave a very reasonable response , ; and he 's probably not gonna be the only one who 's gonna say this in the future
Bro017_1028	aa	that 's yeah , that 's a good thing ; Oh yeah . ; And two gigs of memory . ; That 's right .
Bed013_1437	b	OK . ; But , until Fey is leaving , we surely will hit the some of the higher numbers . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_440	b	Mm - hmm . ; It 's gonna be too hard to do it without a ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2470	b	I don't know . ; so . ; Maybe we know them . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1179	s	We don't know . ; because you have ; I mean some of them are very obvious . ; If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know .
Bmr005_1466	s	Why why not ? ; Well , we can find out . ; I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in in LDC ; getting data ,
Bro023_588	s	right ? ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances ,
Bed006_121	fa	uh by by popular vote ; um ; Didn't take a vote ? ; OK .
Bmr003_2219	s	I see , I see . ; OK , ; good . ; Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this .
Bro014_704	%--	which was not done on our first proposal . ; When you say " we have that " , does Sunil have it now , too , ; I ; or ?
Bmr019_502	qw	and just front - end those pieces . ; Or you can run it on the whole data , ; which is which is , you know , a ; But but but how did we get the how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ?
Bmr011_87	aa	which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . ; Oh , under the NIST meeting . ; Yeah , under the NIST thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1394	s	I mean , I like that idea ; because even a casual user can always send email to whoever 's in charge , ; Mm - hmm . ; and say , you know , " we 'd like these changes "
Bro014_481	aa	But the way they have it now , it 's I guess it 's it 's ; They they compute the relative improvement first ; and then average that with a weighting ? ; Yeah .
Bro027_1905	b	and ; Yeah . ; And then anyway we would have to reduce this with the KLT . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_208	aa	OK . ; Um . ; That you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an ID . ; Right .
Bed010_1000	bk	OK , ; fine . ; And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in in the neighborhood . ; Right .
Bmr006_1652	b	You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . ; Yeah . ; And and but then we would need to label it . ; Yeah .
Bed006_193	b	Mm - hmm . ; That 's generally the way it 's done . ; so if there 's something that you 're sending out you can also s um send me a copy , ; Yeah .
Bro017_1070	s	Yeah . ; That 's an interesting experiment . ; It would be similar similar to ; I knew some people who were uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia ,
Bed002_1206	s	So , y ; Hmm . ; So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to to for slides and whatever net you picked ; and what it can do and and how far you 've gotten .
Bed010_511	ba	Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't here ; because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff , ; Oh right . ; and that was pretty interesting
Bmr021_127	b	Yes . ; So , the only possibilities from Sony are that one and the lapel mike . ; I see . OK . ; OK .
Bmr009_877	s	And the Seat is this number ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Seat and Session . ; " For official use only "
Bmr012_928	s	I don't know . ; Well I don I mean if it 's any better ; No actually I would think that you would you would get better you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike . ; All the way around I 'd think .
Bro019_1136	b	the coe the cepstrum coefficient , ; Uh - huh . ; that , like , the auto - correlation , the R - zero and R - one over R - zero ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_205	b	so . ; Do it . ; That 's ; Yeah .
Btr001_527	b	Hmm . ; If when people talk over one another like constantly , like there 's this whole barrage of voices coming from everywhere , ; um ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1160	b	For HTK ? ; Yeah . ; Really ? ; Well .
Bmr009_583	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a research effort in and of itself ,
Bmr018_1025	s	right ? ; On the table , ; right ? ; And and so I 'm hopeful that that 's possible .
Bro012_1516	s	There were lots of deletions . ; So it was you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths ; Mm - hmm . ; or I didn't have anything like that .
Bns002_502	aa	And so there 's no advantage to uh if it 's aborted , by by any data packets . ; Yeah . ; So this um node has to stop each transmission . ; Yeah .
Bed011_964	%--	SmartKom Human . ; Wizard of Oz . ; OK . ; Same
Bns001_852	s	which is , in principle , also a little bit related to uh to the network . ; But not any application . ; And we also have the aspects for security . ; Miguel , you mentioned here authentication and and triple - A ,
Bmr031_1478	%--	That reminds me of something . ; So . ; We we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it , ; about having a synthesizer driven with
Bro017_1273	%--	uh e ev ; n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation ; Ah yeah . ; because I think he started first just with a plain C C or C - plus - plus or something before
Bro012_1089	b	It was just better . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2228	s	th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things . ; Right . ; But . ; Yeah , I mean , we I had that last time .
Bmr024_134	aa	I mean , that 's the crucial part . ; Right . ; And I think we 'll be able to do that at with this new beep format . ; Yep .
Buw001_2260	%	I wonder if work 's already been done on it . ; Like e expert systems and stuff , ; or ? ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1103	aa	And it it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , ; not the internet backbone core " . ; Now this is a lot of terminology . ; Mmm .
Bed010_122	s	Yeah , ; soon . ; OK . ; And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .
Bmr002_1399	aa	Mm - hmm . ; but I mean this is just wonderful , the uh added level of yeah , compactness in the channels . ; If we can do anything with it , yeah . ; Yep .
Bed015_716	s	Um , ; the I w I would just ; s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat . ; I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms .
Bmr009_937	t1	There we go . ; Oh , yeah . ; I 'll catch up here . ; OK , I see .
Bro005_299	b	OK , go ahead . ; So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1576	s	but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on . ; And , uh ; OK , ; so normalization
Buw001_509	s	Uh ; I 'm not against the idea of a summary , ; Well , i i ? ; By hand .
Bmr028_201	2	And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ? ; So , in that case ; No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript . ; A new transcript .
Bed017_56	s	and can be looked at . ; If you 're interested in that , talk to me . ; Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us . ; Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round .
Bmr022_1439	b	Mm - hmm . ; You can back everything out . ; To your local , or to the global . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_618	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those
Bed002_1016	s	and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , " pppt ! " ; Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them , ; Mm - hmm . ; and see ho how it worked ,
Bro023_960	aa	Yeah . ; Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin . ; Uh - huh . ; That is true .
Bmr028_1526	s	And so it was we had a couple papers like " Towards increasing the error rate in speech " and and so on . ; Hmm . ; Huh ! ; And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , " Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . "
Bed008_1503	%--	Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do ; because ; yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , ; it 's
Bmr026_144	s	It 's more or less ready to go . ; I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera ; and also by the user ID . ; So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .
Bed002_1333	s	Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you what you have there ? ; There there 's more than I showed , ; but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that ; and and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted ,
Bed006_906	%--	and I di don't know if that 's something we need to invent ; or you know just ; The ; wa wasn't there supposed to be a link in the
Bmr013_257	b	But I mean you want you want it be restrictive but you also want it to to to have coverage . ; Right . ; You know i you should . It should be such that if you , if you , uh , if you had o um , all of the features , determined that you that you were uh ch have chosen , that that would tell you , uh , in the steady - state case , uh , the phone . ; Yeah
Bmr008_998	b	That 's true too . ; Or even , you know , I mean , some people who just don't change much in their ; So , ; Yeah .
Bmr018_486	s	and , um , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from from audio view . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , hopefully , I mean ; The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized .
Btr002_451	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , when I 'm clearing the par parentheses , I find that very useful . ; I I sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses , ; Yeah .
Bmr031_776	b	and ; download their data kind of Johnny Appleseed . ; It uh , uh , unfortunately it takes me a week at each site . ; Yeah .
Bed003_261	t1	OK . ; So this right what we ; Let 's see . ; What happens if I maximize this ?
Bed015_144	s	OK , and so in terms of the the relations , ; you know , as usual they 're before and ends . ; I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation ; but in form you might also have a value binding .
Bed006_769	b	In the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description , ; Right ? ; that doesn't hurt the current way . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1136	bk	So , if we 're not talk about the lexic ; Location versus what ? ; instruction . ; Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah .
Bed012_709	s	Um , so ; Oh , I think we should disappoint him . ; Yeah ? ; You or have a finished construction parser and a working belief - net ,
Bmr020_624	s	but I know of another paper that talks about something ; Hmm . ; that ; I 'd like to see that reference too .
Bed015_841	b	And that 's also mostly true for read speech . ; In in real speech , um , people may put stress . ; It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_5	s	well , first of all we h haven't decided whether we 're Meeting Recorder data issues , or recognition this week . ; I think we were recognition . ; Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the ; I mean , I sent you a couple things ,
Bed003_1411	s	This person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business . ; Um , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . ; Um , I don't know . ; They 're in in non in sort of more traditional AI kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something ,
Bro004_1439	s	Cuz we hadn't really done much with tandem systems for larger stuff . ; Cuz we had this one collaboration with CMU and we used SPHINX . ; Uh , we 're also gonna be collaborating with SRI ; and we have their have theirs .
Bns001_599	ba	Cuz yesterday I was uh Well coincidentally , I b bumped into this project here . ; Maybe the project ; n uh ; It 's funny .
Bro024_613	s	So that is the performance for Italian , Finnish and Spanish . ; " Training condition " ; Oh , right . ; So " clean " corresponds to " high mismatch " .
Bmr018_112	qrr	Wait , this is on on Sunday ? ; Cuz they 're flying up that day . ; Saturday . ; Or Saturday ?
Bro017_1175	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; What you know , nowadays , ; yeah .
Bro008_160	s	So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits . ; Mm - hmm . ; That was misreported the first time out . ; It it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested , uh , they were repeating the packets .
Bro004_1431	bk	And there 's something a final thing that you run ; and it accumulates all the counts together . ; Mmm . ; I see .
Bro027_351	bk	Uh @ @ you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; OK .
Bmr028_166	bk	Oh , OK . ; Like , even if we I think that even if we didn't display the waveform , it might be better to , rather , play the waveform than display it . ; I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_76	s	Mmm . ; I see . ; And and and Dave has been working with that and there 's all of those issues . ; But I know that if I go in with something that 's not just digits it would be good .
Bns001_79	s	I hope there will be a match , uh , then , for his future work . ; And the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail . ; I believe we still haven't left our starting position . ; And , um , yesterday I also discussed with Wilbert some things
Bro018_784	%--	So you recognize a phone and which ever phone was recognized , you spit out it 's vector of ones and zeros . ; Mm - hmm . ; I expect you could do that . ; I mean uh
Bro019_1406	s	so , ; um , I kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors I see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a um , Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end , um , and doing recognition . ; Um . ; So , that 's that 's just generally what I 've been looking at .
Bro028_55	aa	Um . ; W It 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the VAD at this point , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr012_815	b	I mean I guess there 's some ; So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences . ; You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance . ; Hmm .
Bro003_1787	s	and you got to , say ninety - three percent , ; and getting to ninety - four really really hard . ; Mm - hmm . ; Another year .
Bmr007_495	s	So you don't want to be c cross - cutting . ; And and , just to finish this , that um That I think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already in the fray . ; But I you know , of certain types . ; Now if it 's just backchannels , people may be doing that with less intention of being heard , just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels ,
Bro004_1055	%--	Maybe ; I don't know exactly how they are obtained . ; It 's on training . ; Training , with the training test of each
Bmr020_169	%	n No . ; Oh . ; Short words . ; because
Bmr020_786	co	We can put it in the same place . ; Yeah , it ; Just put in another directory . ; Well , make ano make another directory .
Bmr018_872	s	I mean it 's it 's not a simple problem . ; But it 's really ; And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off ; and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either .
Bmr019_326	bk	Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . ; And then others were connected digits . ; Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think . ; OK .
Bro018_570	h	Does there some kind of a distance metric that they use ; or how do they for cla what do they do for classification ? ; Um . ; Right .
Bmr012_702	%--	say it 's OK . ; Yeah , we had to get them to approve em ; Right OK . ; and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's
Bmr016_519	%	You have to be German , ; It 's great for the Germans . ; yeah . ; That 's German , yeah .
Btr002_1546	b	but I 'll stretch I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something . ; Right . ; A sort of , like , happy medium , so you can make sure that the waveform has its , like , th g shape . ; Uh , right .
Bro023_303	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , um ; So that 's The improvement is somewhere around , like , thirty percent over the baseline .
Bmr023_671	aa	Like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . ; Yeah . ; I mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time . ; Right .
Bro014_526	ba	on o e e uh ; Right now , nobody would be there , ; but ; Good .
Bmr001_176	s	I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy . ; We 're actually recording I 'm I 'm going through it at the moment , but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this . ; it 's it 's designed to be used for the for the desktop meeting as well . ; But I 'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative .
Bmr009_197	s	Yeah . ; Oh . ; but he d but he doesn't doesn't ; Right . So , we don't know what they look like on the , tsk For the raw .
Bro023_178	2	Just There 's just inter - word silences . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they are , like , pretty short . ; Pretty short .
Btr002_3379	b	Or ; o or if it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed015_2076	s	Yeah , yeah . ; Well that 's probably maybe in the long term that 's good news ; because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an out output . ; Um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time .
Btr001_1053	b	you can kind of tell from the context ; but sometimes it 's hard , ; Yes . ; Right .
Bsr001_2011	2	Oh , ; OK . ; NIST headers . ; Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ?
Bed014_1205	s	The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says " and when you 're done , tell me who fills that slot " or w you know . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um . ; And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it ,
Bmr031_903	ba	And so these right here have been through the double - check . ; These haven't . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , how nice of you ,
Bed015_881	s	But it 's it 's what it uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . ; I mean , because ; Yeah . ; you can just say whatever stuff , " i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever , both , and so forth . "
Bmr005_287	s	No I just I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially . ; So it 's ; So , we need to talk about this later . ; Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .
Bmr026_1134	b	Oh . ; sorry , ; it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . ; Right .
Bed002_476	aa	All it has is some really crude stuff saying , " A person wants to go to a place . " ; Right . ; The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ? ; Right .
Bro028_772	%	OK . ; and I I 'm not sure . ; But , um ; OK .
Btr001_793	bk	Yeah , ; and you can sort of you can sort of keep it going a little bit . ; Right . ; Oh , I see .
Bed008_1088	b	wow , what does that mean ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh ; Mm - hmm
Btr002_2277	b	That 's true . ; We - yeah , we filter all that out . ; we just tune it out , ; Yeah .
Bed014_604	bk	Turn prior on . ; We - yeah th th that 's what I wa I wasn't I was I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas . ; I was just ; Fair enough , OK ,
Bed008_271	s	Yeah , would be a f for a given segment . ; You know , you y you go first go the town square ; Well I eh ; No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge
Bmr014_233	s	right ? ; Uh , no , ; No ? ; we 're having the them do it .
Bro003_162	%--	Why don't we start start over here . ; Um . Well , preparation of the French test data actually . ; OK . ; So , it means that um ,
Bmr002_807	aa	I 'm not actually familiar with it ; but it seems to be the sort of thing that this would be good for . ; But ; Well , yeah ,
Bro022_1170	b	I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain . ; I r I 'm not sure . ; I don't I don't know absolutely nothing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_896	s	I don't know how good quality they are , ; but it would be really interesting to see if they 're good enough . ; Do you mean the kind that hang from the ear , sort of thing , ; The k kind that guys that like to look like they 're really cool at airports wear .
Bed011_779	qh	y so And I like the idea that , you know , sort of ; Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t ; Mm - hmm . ; If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ?
Bed002_1250	s	is show the state and show the system and show that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . ; Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .
Bmr006_1309	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , e I see . ; Yeah . ; Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one .
Bro027_1134	%--	is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch ; You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than ; Mm - hmm . ; Of that
Bns001_542	s	So starting at the CS department at Berkeley ; and then going out the street ; switching to the a campus - wide network , ; uh um I think it 's a Metricom uh network ,
Bmr030_652	b	Cuz it 's all ; Because the whole point is that it 's extracting pie pars parts that are loud anyway . ; It 's all speech . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bdb001_1232	aa	The problem is saying " what are the semantics , ; And ; what do you mean by " merge " ? " ; Right , right .
Bmr003_2606	s	That 's a great idea . ; What ? ; It 's nice it 's nice to be thinking toward that . ; Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer .
Bed016_509	s	Oh , in the presentation here . ; Yeah , that 's what he was talking about . ; Yeah . ; I was ac actually worried about bibtex .
Btr002_3356	s	But that 's the only place you would use a " vocal " " non - vocal " tag , ; where it 's potentially ambiguous between those two categories . ; Cuz otherwise , what I do when I get these , is ; and of course I do my checks ,
Btr002_45	%--	So . Uh , welcome back . ; Thank you for coming . ; Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time ; and maybe , uh , go over some some ideas about , um ,
Bro008_184	bk	but we 'll have to we 'll have to stop it the day before we leave . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So ; Huh .
Btr002_2688	s	And ; I agree with you . ; Right . ; And and I think that 's important
Bed012_932	2	And then , of course , the c I guess , maybe there can be the ; S ; Can there be combinations of the dit ; Discourse - level constructions .
Bro021_1340	aa	Um . ; Also another question might be ; Um , they are doing they 're using first term only of the vector Taylor series ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_583	s	or ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; It was really a pain .
Bmr031_82	b	Really ? ; I mean ; OK . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1311	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , internally , we should just do whatever works , ; Yeah .
Bro018_680	s	Mm - hmm . ; I I don't remember anymore . ; I don't even remember what the task was , ; it was Broadcast News , or something .
Bmr003_724	aa	And in a lot of them you see typos and things like that , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it but it occurs to me that it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1340	bk	I I don't want to change the way we do the meeting . ; I feel like this troublemaker . ; It 's uh so , it was just a comment on the software , not a comment on prescriptions on how you wear microphones . ; OK .
Bns002_298	s	of course , this is only intended for unicast transmissions , ; I mean , only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node . ; OK ? ; But not to broadcast . Uh , to all the nodes .
Buw001_1928	b	Right . ; I mean , that that 's ; Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like search . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_132	s	Is . ; Yeah , th that 's good . ; Yeah . ; So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it .
Bmr016_1162	s	not many . ; So " wanna " is another one , ; " going " uh , " gonna " is another one , ; with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle .
Bro014_245	s	Uh , and the fact is that for right now for the English , they have weights ; they they combine error rates , ; but for the other languages they combine improvement . ; So it 's not very consistent .
Bmr022_1457	s	Right . ; And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all . ; Right . ; Right , but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora .
Bed004_651	ba	Right . ; But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters . ; Right . ; I mean , it 's fine .
Bmr027_603	b	And so far everyone has done email . ; There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method . ; Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on . ; Yeah .
Bns003_285	s	So I tried to do this today ; and if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice ; cuz I 'm quite sure that I can't find every , like , orthographic mistake in it or something . ; Uh , there there there are couple of comments I I have about the web pages .
Bmr005_48	aa	like some other noise . ; Yeah . ; Yes ? ; Uh - huh . Yeah .
Bed012_428	qw	W OK . ; So , someone asked a question . ; Yeah . ; How do we decide how to answer it ?
Bed010_13	aa	Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . ; So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week ; and , I think got a lot done . ; Yeah , I think so too .
Bro022_190	cc	And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , ; cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , um , depending on the timing of the echo . ; So , um , ; I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set ,
Bed005_668	bk	OK . ; We don't I mean , that 's an issue . ; We don't know what , entirely . ; Uh , yeah .
Btr002_2779	b	That person 's not talking at all " . ; So , you just get rid of it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro013_464	s	Clean , and this noise . ; Uh . ; These are the two ; the mixed , the big signal is for clean .
Bsr001_823	2	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , to ground truth very easily ; You can get the ground truth .
Bmr003_1268	qy	And and then ; Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale .
Bmr005_341	b	but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh , I I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping ; I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events , ; to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_707	b	but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth ; and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , ; " were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_115	bk	Well , I think in a p You know , if if you were going for an evaluation system you 'd care . ; But if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice . ; It 's uh , I think the thing is to get something that 's practical , that that you could really use . ; Huh .
Bro013_500	s	Yeah . ; with noise of course ; but but ; Oh . I must to have .
Bsr001_260	%	I mean , just by putting little ; They have so much pressure at th it 's ; But but there there I think , is a t you know , ; I
Btr002_1149	%--	Right . ; OK . So now , ha ha who would 've ; Yes . ; So , if you have a strong
Bmr008_1316	bk	We were guessing you had a bug before ; because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah , yeah yeah .
Buw001_1791	s	Oh , yeah . ; we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing ; and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , ; depending on how you define it , uh , users .
Bns003_575	aa	Can you give us more details of concerning the status ? ; No , ; No ? ; no .
Btr002_860	s	Mmm . ; But . ; Yeah . ; That 's it 's good to be careful about the mousing .
Bmr020_589	s	Took out white space . ; Yeah . ; so I d shrunk it to eight millimeters ; and that helped some . And stuff like that .
Bed009_569	no	Huh ? ; Yeah . ; So , s So what would happen if we sent a note saying " Gee we 've talked about this and couldn't we change this uh th the whole word ? " ; I have no idea how complicated these things are .
Bro010_84	aa	I ; yeah , ; I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to ; Right .
Buw001_2006	b	Mm - hmm . ; Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_454	s	cuz I have four meetings on there , ; The b ; I 'm also using DG ; I got that confused .
Bro027_1981	bk	Oh , right , ; for the Meeting meeting ? ; Yeah , that 's just cuz of something on campus . ; Ah ,
Bmr026_632	%--	Is this gotta be in the morning ? ; So that 's an ; Um ; Or
Bed009_686	s	That 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface ; Oh , yeah , yeah . ; and keep these things like uh tourist information external . ; And then call it external services .
Bmr027_614	bk	I just ; So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Btr002_2970	s	Yeah . ; and , you know , they 're th it 's like the the apparatus is sort of almost kicking in , ; they 're almost gonna say ; but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it
Bed015_415	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , uh , the the mental space thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_784	b	Yeah . ; But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . ; Because there 's lots of interesting problems , of course . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_778	b	Rad ! ; So um you had like an action schema and a Source - Path - Goal schema , ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr031_170	b	Now , that 's a strange ; Well , if we can have three point one four times as much tr transcribed as we recorded , we really would be doing well . ; n ; Yep .
Bro010_436	s	Um . ; uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . ; Yeah . ; And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .
Bmr018_1545	s	Huh . ; Yeah , ; could well be . ; So so , I mean , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point ,
Bro027_1223	ba	uh the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits , ; even though there , again , these m Macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . ; I mean , we weren't talking over a telephone here . ; But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing .
Bmr011_103	%--	yeah , the ; And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . ; And the reason here is just that for the people doing work ; not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,
Btr002_2298	s	Including , I mean , every little aspect . ; I and when I tell people what I do here , ; and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " . ; And they 're they think I 'm like a stenographer or something .
Bmr013_72	s	and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , ; but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . ; And also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript ; cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript .
Bmr018_963	bs	and you 're consistent with th the automatic system , ; Uh , that 's an interesting idea . ; whereas if you delete it ; So so all they So that all they would have to do is put like an " X " there .
Bns002_1227	s	because uh previous versions , if you buy , let 's say , waveLAN , you are tied to waveLAN al the rest of your life . ; But now you can you can have interoperable products from several vendors , ; which is , I think , what , in the past , will power the ethernet uh revolution ; You can buy any any compatible product
Bro013_94	b	But , yeah , so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement , ; Mm - hmm . ; but that 's all with the same amount of data which is pretty small . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2346	s	Do you ; but maybe it shouldn't be funny " ; or " This is funny ; but maybe it 's funny for some sort of perverse reason " .
Bed002_1156	s	you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level . ; Um , Michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts ; and he does it all in MATE , ; and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data .
Bmr016_996	b	Right . ; I mean it just depends how big the file is . ; If the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks ; Right .
Bro011_511	s	if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities ; and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data ; then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . ; But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning
Bmr013_959	b	Yeah . ; I mean it 's probably good enough for force - alignment . ; If it 's not then we 're really then we def definitely ; Yeah .
Bro016_882	bk	And it works on TI - digits ; and on SpeechDat - Car it doesn't work , ; and ; Yeah .
Bro016_543	bk	Well , it 's true , ; except that , uh , that 's what we used in Aurora one , ; and then they designed the things for Aurora - two knowing that we were doing that . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2998	b	and sometimes I 'll even put them in a in a separate bin , ; although that 's that 's not necessary . ; It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1155	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .
Bro022_445	%--	And and they can be surprisingly large . ; It depends on the electronics . ; Oh , ; so it is the digital
Bro017_352	s	Hey ! ; Hey ! ; OK , we need us another another voice here . ; Hey Stephane .
Bed009_660	s	a lot of , ; yeah ; Mmm . ; If if you know if if you can't make it happen then you you do your best .
Bmr009_1196	aa	And they 're proud of it . ; day o ; Yeah . ; Yeah , exactly .
Btr001_1602	b	I That 's just how I am . ; But , like I ; I think I really , like , think of it in terms of re - transcribing it almost ; Yeah .
Bro027_1894	bk	it was giving s slightly better results . ; Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2504	aa	Oh n ; And I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing . ; Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers . ; Yes .
Bed005_1286	s	Right . ; And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher , ; and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior . ; If you don't know anything else about a building , uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level ,
Bmr019_1534	%--	Uh , one is anything that , um , anybody has to say about Saturday ? ; Anything we should do in prep for Saturday ? ; Um ; I guess everybody knows about
Bed016_642	aa	Well , you can " run into " in that sense too . ; But , uh , ; Yeah , " run into " might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense . ; Right .
Bmr014_911	s	The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . ; Whereas this web interface , I just get email , ; it 's all formatted , ; it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it .
Bmr011_25	b	It 's on ? ; Hello . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2364	aa	What 's wrong with yours ? ; If we bought you a a ; Oh , a Applecard . ; Sure .
Bro021_1109	%--	Thanks . ; Well . The idea ; Well , ; we have fixed this equa
Bmr016_2276	%--	But that ; Mm - hmm . ; No . ; I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription
Bro021_1105	bk	Right . ; Now it 's correct . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr026_666	%--	Well , OK , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ? ; Jane may not be . ; Jane , I think . ; Well I know Well , Jane an
Bmr009_582	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_374	ba	but they tend to be pretty good about parentheses . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Good . Good to hear .
Bmr005_88	qy	and it These sorts of things . ; So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type ; and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , ; and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? "
Bmr011_1378	s	But I never heard back ; because we didn't actually advertise openly . ; We a I mean w ; I told I d asked him privately .
Bns002_687	s	which is a problem that we are trying to avoid . ; You know , if we have , because of node motion , we have something like this , ; this is the deployment area of or or node , ; and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here , well maybe these nodes in this area , cannot reach the nodes on this other area .
Bed008_1204	s	Uh ; HTML ? ; Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing ; and then li consider that it 's respective ,
Bmr029_497	s	and so we wanna avoid that . ; So I agree with you . We should we should , uh , do the you know , this sort of cheating experiment . ; OK . ; Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes ,
Bmr023_115	co	Yeah . We 'd have to train . ; We 'd be like a chorus . ; OK . ; Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience .
Bed013_1243	s	So tha is that what you 're t talking about ? ; Exactly . We have su we have specified two . ; wh what kinds of structure we want . ; OK , the next one would be here , just for mood .
Bed004_141	s	OK . ; This is the system breaking down , actually . ; " Did I call Europe ? " ; So , this is it .
Bmr031_1469	s	Yeah . ; Um , but Jeremy 's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side . ; So we have all these waveforms , ; and he 's been with Morgan 's help and , uh , Dan Ellis 's , I think , looking into spectral tilt a bit ,
Bns001_340	s	Yeah , but if this is the final goal , ; it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets ' technology ; Right ? ; Yeah but I I have a point uh regarding the this question , is eh the cost function .
Bmr020_793	b	Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_171	s	so that ; We considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization . ; Mmm . ; So we 've put together all this
Bmr022_548	s	Yep . ; and ; You know actually , what all that we would ; then you can iteratively figure out where the problems are .
Bro005_1148	%--	Yea ; I see . ; Well , see , i oc ; You were doing some something that was
Bro013_693	s	It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved ; and um and you can use channel normalization techniques like ; uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . ; He just does um mean subtraction ,
Bro005_95	s	and one hundred and four when we use delta . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . Even if the contexts used is quite the same , ; because without delta we use seventeenths seventeen frames .
Bmr012_849	ar	and just sti stick them somewhere ; Yeah , it 's it 's really not a problem . ; and I 'll rerun it with ; Actually , no .
Btr001_396	b	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Hmm .
Btr002_3447	ba	Oh . Right . ; I can go . ; OK . ; OK . Wonderful .
Bed014_1428	qw	No , that 's not really true , ; but like ; Bummer . ; What about What about DDR ?
Bro022_621	aa	So is that ? Uh , are are these results comparable ? ; So you you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . ; Right ? ; Um . Uh - huh .
Bmr024_1303	s	I mean , is this , uh uh , iterative , Baum - Welch training ? ; Or is it Viterbi training ? ; Or ? ; It 's Baum - Welch training .
Bro004_941	%--	instead of ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; but I think
Bmr005_726	s	and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth ; Yeah . ; and and something in between with paper rustling . ; We know that all that 's there
Bmr016_1147	s	And if not , then that gets checked . ; Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called " spoken - forms " . ; So there ; mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription .
Btr002_3051	%	I feel really bad now . ; Oh no ! ; I 'm sorry ! ; Right .
Bmr022_1212	s	So I th I think that the " key " file is usefu for notations related to the meeting , ; Well ; B ; But , I mean , the meetings are gonna be the same way .
Bmr007_407	%--	So , it 's um ; Right ? ; I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it . ; Well , we 've als
Btr001_2374	b	Maybe this is funny because it 's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way . " ; Mmm . ; Huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1145	b	cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_1118	s	Well , there 's a there 's ; and that wouldn't be a problem to have it , uh , pause plus breath plus laugh plus sneeze ? ; Yeah , i ; You know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know ,
Bed009_456	b	Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ? ; So that 's that 's really something we ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1291	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That is p that is that is possible .
Bro027_1137	aa	Of that ; I mean , the SNR after the noise compensation of the SpeechDat - Car . ; Oh , ; so Right .
Bro013_177	%--	well , let 's say if we if we add enough data to train on the um on the Meeting Recorder digits , I guess we could have better results than this . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; And .
Bmr002_1426	s	I 'm glad . ; Yeah . ; Good . ; Eric 's really got it easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive .
Bns003_348	bk	So maybe ; I don't know if this is different in Spain . ; That would be fine too , to have some information , or in D nnn Holland . ; OK .
Bro023_1698	s	S so , yeah . ; Uh , ; so yeah , ; the next thing I started to do is to , uh , try to develop a better voice activity detector .
Bro005_642	s	So I take exactly the same configurations , ; seven bands with nine frames of context , ; and we just train on TIMIT , ; and on the large database ,
Bmr006_56	s	Great . ; Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . ; Right . ; But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth .
Bmr014_631	s	And say it to you . ; Uh , OK , and ; Yeah . ; That 's that 's basically the the the thing .
Bed006_967	aa	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you have constraints that are dependent on the c actual s specific filler , uh , of some attribute . ; Mm - hmm , yeah .
Bro026_31	s	I don't know if they use it , ; but . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , I I don't think anybody up there is like working on it right now .
Bro019_759	ba	So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK , ; so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , ; and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , ; and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,
Bro026_1003	bk	Right . ; And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories ; I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments ; Right .
Bed014_605	%--	We - yeah th th that 's what I wa I wasn't I was I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas . ; I was just ; Fair enough , OK , ; but , but , in terms of the c c the current implementation
Bed015_165	bk	Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . ; Yeah . ; So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr022_1371	b	Mm - hmm . ; maybe , m you know , they could they could 've told you , ; but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you , ; Right .
Bed006_299	s	Mm - hmm . ; and we want to maybe ask them , if you have get it sort of isolated street ; the the , whatever , ; " River Street " ,
Bed009_282	b	Right , ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_180	b	I mean , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on . ; But and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things , ; th these things I would guess , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1867	%	Oh , they 're clean . ; Well ? ; um , without a lot of background noise , ; Yeah !
Bed008_1505	b	yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , ; it 's ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro023_14	b	uh ; Uh , we 'll see . ; We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something . ; Huh .
Bmr030_611	s	You can , ; but they never will be able to read them . ; Yeah . ; I assume that you can send them anything that they can access with HTTP .
Bmr012_717	s	that 's all . ; Well we , ; I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it ; hopefully it will be fairly quick
Bmr014_793	aa	You know ? ; Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former . ; It depends on what meetings . ; That 's true .
Bed012_597	s	It 's there 's a ; OK . ; Um , by the way , are Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy are coming ? ; So we can figure this out .
Bmr012_360	b	there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , ; I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see ; I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_65	s	And why don't you also copy Jane on it ? ; And , um , ; Are we Have we concurred that , uh , these these forms are sufficient for us , and necessary ? ; Uh , th I think they 're necessary .
Bmr003_970	s	So I I need to we need to look at what what the final output is ; but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . ; Yeah . ; I 've already become pretty familiar with the format ,
Bmr016_2137	b	yeah , basically . ; Mm - hmm . ; But other than that I it sounds great . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_149	s	So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? ; Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together ; so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless . ; So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike ,
Bmr025_944	s	Yeah . ; Oh , nicely put . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually ,
Bro027_1233	aa	When I added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions . ; Yeah , so I don't you know how to interpret that , ; but , mmm ; Yeah .
Bns002_1062	s	You can have the destinations you would like to or the in the I P addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know ; Yeah . ; even if it 's not the direct neighbor , ; but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through , put it in the I P header .
Bmr020_846	ba	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK , ; good .
Btr001_117	s	so . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Just got better ,
Bmr008_516	s	They had divided things up into regions . ; But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English . ; No , no . ; It would only be f if you said American English
Bmr020_1516	aa	Well he 's saying , you know , that the the EDU meeting was a good good meeting , ; In a good meeting , ; what ? ; Yeah .
Bmr030_595	s	They couldn't use C Ds ? ; No , because the transcription company does what they do . ; They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in ; and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that .
Bed011_809	aa	you know . ; Yeah . ; Right , that 's true . ; Right .
Bmr024_896	s	So you don't wa you don't wanna put ir un reproduceable data on them . ; Uh - huh . ; Wear out after what amount of time ? ; Year or two .
Bro017_767	s	S yeah effectively what you 're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation . ; Right ? ; Oop . ; The spread ,
Btr002_683	b	There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless , ; which was , um , mechanically bad in some some sense , ; Loose . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_106	no	but ; Yeah , exactly . ; Did he ever figure out how to d switch between applications like he was wanting to do ? ; I don't know .
Bmr003_1180	co	Ten . ; yeah , I was gonna say eight ; you 'd say ten ? ; Let 's say ten .
Bed008_1036	b	Uh I gu yes my curr you know , don't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . ; Yeah . ; Uh My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_791	%--	Hmm ! ; So , I ; So a meeting with me in it . ; maybe someone can help me find a good candidate and then I would be willing to
Bmr026_748	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah that would be good . ; I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls ; and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in
Bro005_1194	s	That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . ; So they did At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . ; So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? ; I mean they they were not not using the neural net .
Bro022_798	b	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . ; But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , ; Right .
Bmr016_2124	b	They 're spelled the same way , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And they 're still gonna be transcribed as READ . ; Right .
Bmr031_1421	%--	Anything else ? ; So . Well , I 'll just really briefly , um ; So , I 've been working with Don and also and and Andreas on the this paper on prosody , ; and what we 're trying to do is predict where people at
Bro024_1652	b	You start up . ; As far as I remember you you smooth somehow the envelope , ; you smooth somehow the noise estimate , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_84	s	with , uh , Manolo Pardo and Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was here before , ; was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries . ; So , in what Javier did before when they were doing , um ; h he was looking for , uh , speaker change points .
Bro023_710	bk	Ah , ; I see . ; and then pick some from that ; Oh , OK .
Bmr026_616	s	The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that um uh , I talked briefly to Mari ; and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here ; but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . ; And I I I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings ,
Bro005_890	aa	and ; I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . ; So it And that has other noise . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1507	b	Mmm . ; God , it must take them a really long time to do these . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro026_525	%--	uh So what 's next ? ; Maybe s s remind us . ; So the meeting with Hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gonna freeze in this system ? ; Is that ?
Bmr006_1347	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think Dan is still working on it . ; So . He actually he wrote me about it a little bit ,
Bro008_403	cc	Mm - hmm . ; You you ; you , um ; So , uh , we still have stuff to do .
Bmr012_701	b	Yeah OK . ; say it 's OK . ; Yeah , we had to get them to approve em ; Right OK .
Bmr027_1318	ba	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; That 's it . ; It 's great to be able to do it ,
Bmr025_195	b	And it it 's looking pretty good , ; you know , the fact that I got the query system working . ; So if we wanna just do a video - based one I think that 'll be easy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_975	g	And so I didn't realize it before . ; It 's like , " oh ! " It was an epiphany that it you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . ; So topic is ; Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK ,
Bmr008_325	b	Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down . ; Yeah . ; So I don't want to make them feel like they have to . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1364	%	Yeah , it was it was slightly worse . ; Uh . ; Slightly bad . ; Yeah .
Bro014_112	%--	OK . ; So it 's a very simple change to make ; and it doesn't seem to hurt all that much . ; So you you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a
Bsr001_1553	%--	Well , some peo people speak with their mouth full , you know that 's a @ @ . ; an and , uh ; Yeah that ; But a lot of the
Bro024_808	%--	Thanks Adam . ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Well , that 's
Bmr027_92	bk	Oh , I see . ; You said you wanted it to be available then . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro004_755	s	it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . ; Yeah but , we know that ; Right . ; And in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions .
Bro023_831	s	which is a technique that it 's often used . ; " Subtracting more " , meaning ? ; So you overestimate the noise spectrum . ; You multiply the noise spectrum by a factor , uh , which depends on the SNR .
Bmr008_847	no	But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get , ; but we could say uh " where did you live before you were five ? " , ; " where did you live after you were five ? " , ; I don't know .
Bro017_1042	s	Yeah . ; right ? ; Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was , ; but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company
Bmr011_1423	ba	So ; They 'd be really good . ; Yeah . ; They 're they 're very they 're very consistent .
Btr001_2113	%--	um , ; so we still technically ; uh you know I mean , what should we do in terms of tea ? ; Technically
Bns002_549	b	So ; when you hear one uh CTS or one uh RTS packet , you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or , that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive You know the length . ; You know the bit rate , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_716	bk	You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model . ; You just may n may need to c uh give uh less weight to to uh a mod uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature . ; You don't have to retrain it . ; Oh .
Bmr028_1413	bk	We 're not saying that the data is cheating data . ; We 're saying th we are cheating by using this data . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr026_379	b	Uh , well , tonight . ; Oh , oh well . ; You mean he won't set up the ; mmm .
Buw001_1933	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So we can we can we can do better than that . ; We can do that . Yeah .
Bmr023_779	b	OK . So that ; So that 's So that 's not the problem . ; That 's not the problem . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1020	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I have a convention that if it 's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation a speech error with you know , wi within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native English American English speaker , you know that I didn't mean to say " microfon . " ; Then you 'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word ,
Bed005_1088	g	OK . ; And the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these , ; so we don't need to specify any probabilities . ; We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ?
Bmr030_482	b	Mmm . ; And so there 's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back . ; And I 've already given him three more to work on , ; OK .
Bmr023_899	s	This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . ; So we we had , uh ; Hmm . ; ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data
Bmr003_293	%--	Oh , really ? ; Yeah . ; Different for you . ; Visit my friends and spend some time
Bed015_672	b	Or if you talk about an adjective " red " , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red . ; So we used to use the notation " with " for this ; and I think that 's closest to their second one . ; Right .
Bmr029_413	b	Right . ; OK . ; Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_547	b	uh I and originally ; people are very picky about this . ; Does it have a speaker ; Mmm .
Bmr031_273	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Are the same . ; Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words ; Sure .
Bed003_810	s	then of course , this is sort of binary as well . ; Yeah . ; And then um , there 's also the question whether it may be entered . ; In the sense that , you know , if it 's Tom the house of Tom Cruise , you know , it 's enterable but you may not enter it .
Bmr027_1170	%--	Right . ; Um , ; because I , uh , I could use one on my workstation , ; just to t
Bmr008_1629	s	Yeah . ; you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything . ; Yeah . ; So I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough that there 's some voicing in each of them , by each of the speakers , then you should do very well if you do this .
Bed010_94	bk	Mm - hmm . ; so I 'd uh have to add " am walking , " ; or I 'd have to add a little stem for the " am " , when I build the built the tree . ; OK .
Bed010_361	bk	It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it , ; Not not at this point . ; and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page , ; Right .
Bed003_1085	b	Yeah . ; Well I ; Actually we could write a program that could generate this . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1480	%--	is there more to be said ? ; I think ; um ; In principle what I I think that this approach does ,
Bns001_938	s	Maybe they already did it par as part of UMTS , ; I 'm not sure . ; I don't have a clue . ; I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet
Bro024_1691	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_887	bk	Well they they do send it out ; but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . ; Ah ! ; Oh . OK .
Btr002_2270	b	Yeah . ; Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist . ; Not literally what people are saying ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_256	s	Right . ; But I mean you want you want it be restrictive but you also want it to to to have coverage . ; Right . ; You know i you should . It should be such that if you , if you , uh , if you had o um , all of the features , determined that you that you were uh ch have chosen , that that would tell you , uh , in the steady - state case , uh , the phone .
Bmr026_1020	%--	We were probably at least a factor or two off . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh
Bmr018_1173	b	The problem with those , they 're all German . ; And e and e and extremely hard to follow , like word - wise , ; So . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1777	ba	Right . ; so I shouldn't be the one to talk . ; But ; No , I think that 's fine .
Bmr025_676	b	Wonderful . ; it worked . ; Wonderful . ; Hmm !
Bro004_695	bk	Uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . ; So . Uh , I changed the code ; uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the OGI baseline . ; OK .
Bed009_258	ar	Well th uh ; how we do it , ; yeah that 's the ; No no .
Bro010_897	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh ; so ; so that 's just that 's just one detector .
Buw001_275	%--	Yeah . ; And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? ; I mean , that gives you a summary ; but it doesn't really
Bns002_442	bk	at the MAC layer . ; He have to do it for all data packets ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro005_678	s	there are that use bad on - line normalization , ; and other good on - line normalization . ; Um . ; With respect to the features ,
Btr002_77	s	or an overlap , ; Mm - hmm . ; or ; but they 're not usually that bad , I I don't think .
Bro025_621	s	so we can have a better VAD by training the net on the cleaned - up speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see . I see . ; Yeah , but we need a VAD for uh noise estimation also .
Bro007_446	bk	it just ; It is , ; but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data ; Oh yeah .
Bmr008_642	b	It 's OK . ; But it 's ; We have several categories that are specifically constrained , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_612	bk	like the English language sentence of it is " these are the follow you know the following films are being shown " or something like that ? ; Yeah , but it in that sense it doesn't make In that case uh it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud . ; S ; Right .
Bro026_72	s	Great ! ; Oh . ; But it 's So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH . ; I don't s I didn't set up You can also set up a CVS server on a new port .
Bed014_702	no	maybe . ; I 'll have to think about that . ; Hmm . ; I don't know .
Bro004_423	ar	and testing on the other one ? ; Yeah . ; Not yet . ; Uh , no .
Bmr007_1055	b	because if there 's if most of the overlaps you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and and the rest of them are low , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_509	aa	Yeah , but ; like ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_265	s	and even though I 've taken French , and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much harder ; and maybe also because the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ? ; Oh . ; If you 're talking about who I think you 're talking about
Bro004_1029	s	I guess they mean voice activity detection So again , it 's the silence ; So they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , I believe . ; Um I asked uh Hynek whether ; I haven't talked to Sunil
Btr001_174	bd	Oh , OK . ; Yeah , good c ; Oh , it doesn't look so bad , ; but , I guess it depends really .
Bed002_354	%--	So this is not something which we can actually monitor , now , ; but just is something we can set . ; And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out . ; We want to have an a structure resulting
Bns002_185	bk	and eh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point , any kind of uh mmm external network , ; because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based , ; it 's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person , which is in front of us . ; OK ,
Bmr003_270	bk	Well , I think I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . ; Yeah , ; that 's right . ; Right ,
Bmr014_739	aa	And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . ; Mm - hmm . ; The other thing too is it seems like ; Um , yeah , that 's true .
Bed008_816	b	because uh we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties ; Mm - hmm . ; s ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1326	s	Yeah . ; This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in . ; Very interesting . ; Exactly these .
Bmr006_1748	b	Mm - hmm . ; And that violates our privacy issue . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_306	%--	But I mean I 'm I 'm not really sure ; Uh , because I don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet . ; I mean w we have tested this and a y ; have you heard listen to the f first two or th
Btr001_923	s	Well , I 've ; Mm - hmm , ; I it it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly . ; There was an adjustment ,
Btr001_2151	s	yeah . ; mm - hmm . ; that 's right . ; And I found that really interesting ,
Bro010_1191	%--	uh , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , ; but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline . ; Uh , it still won't be perfect because there 's noise . ; Uh , but
Bmr024_830	b	I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . ; The non - backed - up , ; I haven't looked to see how much of that we have . ; yeah ,
Bed013_964	s	it has admission fees , ; it has this , it has that , ; and then we we we make a thesaurus lexicon , look up , ; and then search dynamically through the uh , discourse history for occurrences of these things in a given window of utterances .
Bed014_1188	%--	OK . Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry ? ; It would make sense . ; OK . ; Oh yeah , the basic idea is that
Bmr010_414	%--	Yeah , ; but that 's that 's OK , ; Yeah . ; cuz they 're they 're ,
Bmr025_317	s	The Windows system isn't any harder ; because it it looks like a BSD system . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the " include " files are a little different and the function calls are a little different .
Btr002_1851	%--	Yes . Oh , yes . ; And he got to transcribe this meeting . ; Yeah , ; And there was all this meta stuff about
Buw001_1837	s	If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh , major communications between Dan and UW folks ; Yeah . ; I mean , ; I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August .
Bro024_625	bk	So that 's ; Which means decrease in word error rate ? ; Yeah . ; OK ,
Bro023_890	s	That means that ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So so yeah , you have an an estimation of the noise spectrum ,
Bed005_225	b	OK . So . Wonderful parse , ; same thing . ; Um . ; Right .
Btr001_2747	b	so it 's not so important . ; It 's more important to focus on the words , ; because there we don't know the ground truth . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1209	%--	Maybe . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean , one of the things about
Bmr016_2106	bk	The number " seven " ? ; The word . ; The word " seven " , OK . ; Yeah .
Btr001_344	%	Huh . ; Oh , wow . ; And and m eh the way he said " mixed " was really strange , too . ; Ah !
Bro008_462	%--	So , um ; I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something ; sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something ; we take a very
Bmr024_1265	b	So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test . ; Yeah . ; And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test . ; Yeah .
Bro011_506	s	OK . ; then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . ; I see . ; And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength .
Bmr007_1345	bk	Get the bolts , " whh whh " ; Let 's do it . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr011_1588	s	Alright . ; And so that would make sense . ; the the the German was much better , ; I didn't have the context of that .
Bed004_496	s	Close this down . ; So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us , ; um ; And a very simple thing .
Btr001_654	s	Huh . ; I don't know . ; Huh . ; Kind of an interesting research project .
Bmr010_1275	s	With what ? ; Scale . ; Scale . ; Eh , and I I change the scale and we can see the the variance .
Bro018_703	s	and I was like , " wait , this is Is the mapping from N to to this phonological feature called um " coronal " , ; is is should it be shouldn't it be a one ? ; or should it should it be you know coronal instead of not coronal as it was labelled in the paper ? " ; So I ha haven't hunted down all the all the mistakes yet ,
Bmr014_874	s	Nobody 's being l libeled . ; You know , this is this we 're we 're covering ; We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . ; If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache .
Bed008_233	s	So it 's true or false ? ; OK . No no no , ; No , that 's that 's a ; EVA .
Bed008_213	b	I I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had " Is he staying in our hotel ? " , ; " Is he staying with friends ? " , ; and so forth ; Yeah .
Bro023_1659	s	I mean , um , you know , in in JRASTA we were essentially adding in , uh , white uh , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; On the overall estimate of the noise . ; Uh , I think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there .
Bmr016_1965	s	Point FIVE , yeah . ; " Point five . " ; Good . ; And then , in here , " NUMS " ,
Bmr016_615	bk	Yeah . ; Right . ; That 's ; Yeah sure .
Bro003_1639	s	Um , but if it 's experiments and you 're creating files and things that you 're gonna need , you probably wanna have those on a disk that 's backed up , just in case something goes wrong . ; So . ; Um ; So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things ,
Bsr001_2046	aa	so ; Which is ver it 's it 's very good , ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bed012_537	s	Show us the way , Bhaskara . ; I guess the other thing is that um , yeah . ; I mean , when you 're asked a specific question and you don't even ; Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node ,
Btr001_127	bk	but that 's all . ; Well these here are the P Z ; that right there . ; Oh .
Btr001_910	br	Uh - huh . ; You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is . ; I always get confused with the pronunciation convention . ; Sorry , what was this ?
Bmr022_1337	s	So we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they wanna make . ; Well ; Well , I see now , we 're k back into the same situation as when we were , uh , talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public . ; So there 's a question of how easy or how hard to modify ,
Bmr019_1110	bk	Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use use " spurt " for that . ; Good . ; They do ? ; Oh .
Bmr003_2518	b	R ; As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , " can you talk a bit louder ? " ; I had ; Yeah .
Bmr021_227	s	Cool . ; Yep . ; Uh - huh . ; Four more wireless .
Bro013_690	s	a two second window ; then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window ; and the then it um then things are l more linear . ; It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved
Bed003_1652	ar	I actually wanted to show that to you guys now ; but um . ; Do you want to trade ? ; Um , no
Btr002_2893	b	And so I did an analysis ; and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_999	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Or even just have one or two people stay behind . ; Ugh .
Bdb001_1138	s	overlapping with any other , uh , word uh , i segment of any length . ; And , um , ; then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel , ; or you can say that it was , um , a usurping of the turn ,
Bmr024_157	s	That 's interesting . ; I didn't hear that . ; Yeah . ; But with this new format , um , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it shouldn't throw them .
Bed008_1268	s	right ? ; So um that 's what we want , ; we want for example P of um ; let 's call this guy Y
Btr002_1192	bk	Oh , that 's true . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; I forgot about that one , ; Oh .
Bmr006_1794	bk	No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said " Jose " in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . ; Right . ; But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " that you could replace it with " speaker - seven " . ; Oh I see .
Bed011_1091	b	Yeah . ; We could sit down and think of sort of the the ideal speaker utterances , ; and I mean two or three that follow each other , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_806	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; What about just a different headband thing ? ; And some people do ,
Bmr002_658	aa	what uh I mean , can you spare like a minute or two of a ; Sure . Sure . Sure . ; Sure . ; Sure .
Bmr003_1595	aa	then I indicated it as a segment which contained @ @ this utterance plus an overlap . ; OK . ; But that 's but there 's only one there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , ; Yeah ,
Bmr011_763	s	And the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half . ; How big is the data set ? ; Oh , it 's what I mean is one meeting . ; Each each person got their own meeting .
Bmr028_260	s	and there must be some ; I 'll I 'll work on it with Don and see what I 'm doing wrong . ; Yeah . I mean , just ask Just come by my office . ; I can show you as well .
Bmr011_1667	s	Oh , OK . ; and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . ; Really . ; But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff ,
Bro007_254	b	See the I mean the reason I 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ? ; Mm - hmm ? ; So uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word , ; Yeah .
Bns002_628	bk	I 'm getting more uh let 's say more gain than another . ; Yeah , ; And that 's true ; OK .
Bmr021_926	aa	uh ; Right . ; So you 'd wanna do a linear transform also . ; Right .
Bmr018_1230	2	Yeah . ; Right . ; Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here , ; It 's more balanced .
Bmr001_611	s	There 's a sound there 's actually sound output built into this thing . ; Yeah . ; But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet . ; And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in .
Bed008_965	bk	there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't ; uh ; Uh but this isn't , this is this line is just coming from over here . ; OK .
Bed014_298	s	I so I I did see that . ; Oh wha Yeah . Before we get started on this st ; so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler , who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the , um , you know , using these structured belief - nets and stuff ; but starting in August ,
Bns001_617	b	OK . ; That 's right . ; And he 's also board in Nokia research , ; OK .
Bmr022_1329	s	Mm - hmm . ; If I found an error , and I sent them email and said " here 's this error " , and I didn't get a response for a couple weeks , I would stop sending them the my data ; and I would start collecting it here ; and we would end up with two corpora .
Bro007_448	s	but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data ; Oh yeah . ; which is which is I guess all the multilingual stuff ; and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .
Btr002_885	s	Mmm . ; Really ? Oh , I do that with the keyboard . ; Well , I would press " tab " ; I do that with the mouse , yeah .
Bro014_1097	s	at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically . ; Like which of the ? ; No . ; Uh , so the mel cepstrum is the is the is the cepstrum of this this , uh , spectrum or log spectrum ,
Bro019_351	aa	Yeah . ; LDA . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_260	b	Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help . ; Yeah . ; I agree , yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro010_559	s	Right ? ; And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know . ; Yeah . ; So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians ,
Btr002_2050	s	Oh my god ! " ; I had that same reaction . ; Yeah . ; Absolutely . And sometimes these are meetings I participated in .
Bmr025_157	b	So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1241	%--	Mm - hmm . ; but it might help in combination . ; Mmm . ; But I I I have to tell you ,
Bed006_1349	%--	I don't know . Like ; How do I how do I come at this question ? ; Um . ; I just don't see why you would
Bed005_815	s	Right . ; or , " who 's pushing proof " ; Nuh . ; er , just pick pick any of them
Bed005_1456	no	Uh . ; But he did do it . ; Yeah . ; I don't see why the , uh , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into
Bdb001_61	s	OK , ; yeah . ; So you should , definitely . ; Um , so so it definitely had that as a concept .
Bmr003_1816	b	It 'd b a a ; it w ; Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ? ; Yeah .
Bmr010_732	b	but they didn't have them for breathing in . ; Uh ; Yeah . ; That 's interesting .
Bro003_1178	no	I don't know . ; I don't know what a Ravioli is . ; I don't know . ; I don't know .
Bro022_725	b	I guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats , or something . ; Right ? ; I mean ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1436	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bed013_376	aap	Well , it seems to me that um ; Wait , is this a computer science conference ; or is it a ; Um , well it 's more
Bed009_659	b	And a I a a good design would would allow that to happen . ; a lot of , ; yeah ; Mmm .
Bmr020_1123	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; Whi - which could have one drawback . If there is uh a backchannel in between those three things , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1146	s	What it comes down to but ; Yeah I think actually ; my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . ; You know , if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that .
Bmr021_517	s	So at any rate , so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we 're gonna do and then when we 're gonna do it . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm not sure who isn't involved with that . ; I mean , certainly me , Chuck and Jane .
Bmr028_1357	s	Cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology ? ; Cuz it sounds like it sort of devalues the the , um , all other approach , which is to to put those distinctions in . ; Maybe . I I 've heard this at ICSLP for years and years and years , though . ; I mean , it 's it 's pretty pretty common . People say this .
Bmr021_626	ba	There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone , ; one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between " sponsor " and their name . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh no , oh no .
Bed012_528	s	and then ; Yeah , I didn't intend to say that every possible ; OK . ; There was a confusion there ,
Bmr005_124	s	But , yeah , I think I think it was optimistic . ; So anyway , that 's that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might might might come out from some of this . ; But he can use text , basically . ; I mean , he 's talking about just using text
Bed009_593	%--	That 's why I 'm saying . ; I think you can't ; it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV . ; You go to th
Bmr029_825	s	Do you have this , uh ? ; I think so . ; I 've I I have to check . ; In any case , I could retrain short models within a few hours actually at if I use machines at SRI .
Bro024_1708	s	w you you could do it in this way that you say , if you if I 'm ; you have somehow a noise estimate , ; Mm - hmm . ; and , if you say I 'm I 'm with my envelope
Bro004_1247	fa	Hmm . ; but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand ; Yeah . ; sorry
Bed003_1164	s	Do I have more slides ? ; Um yes , ; one more . ; " Future Work " .
Btr001_2628	b	and you can do really good speech recognition that way . ; So they have some papers out that they 've done this . ; It 's really it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses . ; Huh .
Bro011_648	%--	Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . ; Mm - hmm . ; Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , ; but just sort of eh you know you t you i z
Bmr031_1399	b	Uh , and in all th the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at regions that you think are nonspeech in order to get noise statistics . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh , ; Right .
Bro013_448	no	Mm - hmm . ; and is not ready yet to use on , ; Yeah . ; well , I don't know .
Bed013_1301	s	Do y So , would you wanna say that those two are both , like ; Those are the two interpretations , right ? ; the the ones that are location or path . ; So , you could say that the s construction is a question asking about this location ,
Bed006_322	%--	New new set up . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Which I 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t
Bsr001_609	b	So ; that 's how I ended up working on this project instead . ; Hmm . ; Huh .
Bmr011_467	s	both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . ; Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm not sure . ; So . ; All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings .
Bmr019_1765	ft	and you you find a solution in in in some few tim uh , months , eh ? ; OK . ; But , eh , I think it 's not , eh , common . ; But , eh , anyway , thank you .
Bdb001_595	s	Actually , it 's the channel , I think , that ; Is i ? ; You know , ; or something like that .
Bro003_1115	aa	So , in the broader training corpus we can we can use , uh , the three , or , a combination of of two two languages . ; Database three . ; In one net . ; Yeah .
Btr002_125	ba	But , actually when you listen to it , it would be " Spurts wouldn't be . Right ? " ; Oh . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro010_190	bk	So , yeah . ; Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , ; but ; Ah !
Bmr006_658	b	No . ; OK . ; I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1581	b	Um ; i it 's not I mean , they 're sort of not in the same kind of category as , say , a phonetic target or a syllabic target ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_490	aap	you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off . ; On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . At these noise levels .
Btr002_1480	s	It 's ; Yeah . ; And then down here you have the soundwave , ; and then something down here ,
Bro017_313	s	Hmm . ; Then the question is uh " can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions " , or to what extent ? ; Because uh ; And and and so on and so on .
Bdb001_1302	ba	He he 's a language modeling person , though . ; Um ; So so imagine ; I think his his example is a good one .
Bed006_538	s	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was completely flabbergasted here ; and I and that 's also it 's it 's going to produce the concept - to - speech uh blah - blah - blah information for necessary for one point one in English
Bro025_524	b	it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea . ; Uh , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_229	%--	But ; Uh , OK , yeah . So the only ; That might work too . ; Yeah , I was just thinking that actually temporally just , uh , uh , uh , an increasing tones so that
Bmr002_893	s	And so um I think it would be something that we should work uh together with , in terms of uh seeing how this ; Sure . ; Right . ; Here 's another thing I got .
Bmr026_387	s	I 'm just saying he 's gone . ; I I thi ; Yep . ; I have um I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .
Bmr006_1408	ba	Very complex , uh Yeah . ; It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . ; Yeah . ; That is cool .
Bmr002_1184	b	Yeah . ; there ; OK . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1691	s	and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . ; And that 'll go back to IBM ; and they 'll they 'll , uh they run their aligner on it ; and it kicks out things that don't work well ,
Bro003_2064	b	So you can't really feed it , like , two articulatory features that are on at the same time with ones ; cuz it 'll kind of normalize them down to one half or something like that , for instance . ; But perhaps you have the choice of the final nonl ; Right .
Bmr028_694	s	Sorry . Beep . ; Well , OK . That 's the point . ; So it 's Jane that we have to coordinate that through . ; Uh , what I was gonna say is , as soon as possible , and I 'm willing to not work for an hour to get it done .
Bed006_576	aa	Then um ; Are they is it using the database ? ; the German TV movie . ; Yeah .
Bro004_188	%--	Yeah . ; OK ? ; Uh So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data um or number ; so ,
Bmr013_1019	br	That says a lot . ; For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . ; and ; Excuse me ?
Bed012_840	%--	You 're a geek . ; It 's O K . ; I ; How do you pronou
Bmr019_1395	s	So they just do a little grep for ; Do uh , d d ; Um . ; Do not do not we are not setting a good example .
Bdb001_342	qy	but it 's , um , probably not as sophist ; And I think there 's ; Well , what does H T K do for features ? ; Or does it even have a concept of features ?
Bro004_1216	%--	But But , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . ; So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been ; if you look at what we 've been trying , ; we 're uh looking at uh ,
Bsr001_1575	no	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I mean , I haven't been in these , uh , you know , preliminary de decision meetings , ; but I don't know what 's the idea for the computer interaction .
Bed006_1512	aa	Uh yeah wait ; This is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions . ; R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine . ; Sure .
Bed015_1362	b	and " what you want " is a world . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Btr002_1141	bk	U u ; Hmm . ; And the one to the left of that against the far corner is Linguine . ; Good .
Bmr001_268	aa	Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it ? ; Cuz that 's that 's one way we could sneak it in . ; Uh , that is an interesting point . ; Yeah .
Bro025_570	s	Yeah . So you just update only doing or update only the stationary components . ; Yeah . So , that 's so that 's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying ; Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , um , ; eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general .
Bed003_849	%--	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So we would have
Btr001_839	b	and then with this little tiny millisecond pause . ; So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe , there 's pauses somehow , ; I guess ; Hmm .
Bed005_976	qrr	Yeah . You could ; Uh ; Yeah . ; Or shall I just use this ?
Bsr001_2328	%--	OK . ; Right , right . ; Right . ; Yeah , we 're doing digits
Bns002_123	s	So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission , ; the cellular vehicle was only one , and was uh walking around , uh roaming around the base station , which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network , ; but it was only one mobile node , of course . ; Nothing prevents ,
Btr002_2235	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , you can see these the inbreaths and things .
Btr001_406	b	I mean , do you think that , um , that , uh , maybe ; I mean , being ; I mean , not that I would know that . ; Mmm .
Bro027_1725	bk	Yeah . So it it 's an additional discriminating information . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr020_155	s	Yeah . ; that 's that 's a great idea . ; Well ; there there were some interesting results in this paper , though .
Bns002_1297	s	Five bucks . ; And that means your mouse , and and and ; Five bucks chip . ; Yeah , and and and whatever kind of of eh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have , is Bluetooth - based .
Bmr005_962	bk	Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ? ; And ; Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files . ; Yeah .
Bed004_695	s	Yeah . ; And um it Output is whatever , as well . ; But this information is just M - three - L , ; and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology
Bmr008_356	b	And it isn't it isn't that boldf ; And having a little instruction sheet and say " If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . " ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_292	s	Maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other . ; So do you think it 's reasonable to display more than one before the demo ? ; Cuz ; Um , I think I 'd h I 'd have to ask Dave .
Bmr014_76	s	So . ; Um . Let 's see . ; I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription ; you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .
Bns001_1009	b	It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML , ; but that 's all what 's uh ; It 's not IP at all . ; Right .
Bns001_1779	s	of of everybody , also from the institution behind . So If there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever , we are s only a small group of people ; we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion . ; Well , if Klaus ; It must not be on every Tuesday , you know ,
Bro004_1066	bs	That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question , ; then now that it I understand it . It 's ; " yeah , ; where does the LDA come from ? "
Btr001_1724	s	I don't ; c Yeah . It 's it 's good to ; If it sounds like a yawn . ; I 've transcribed yawns ,
Bmr002_385	ba	Well , Sarah has one ; Oh , I see ! ; because she does a lot of transcribing of interviews . ; Oh , super !
Bed003_1671	%--	so it you know , my computer does not know its IP address , ; you know ? ; Ah . ; You know . So .
Bmr020_714	s	MTGC ; What is it again ? ; CR ; u R D RDR ,
Btr001_362	%	Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand , ; they ; and then everyone would say , " What was that again ? " ; Oh , eh
Bed010_285	s	e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . ; And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . ; And so it 's ; And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said " yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version " .
Bmr015_1215	s	I see . ; One of the ; um , just to add to this ; one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them .
Btr001_106	s	Not a bad strategy . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Some of them just occurred over and over the again ,
Bro021_799	%--	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; And also I did some experiment , uh , doing , um , a lying estimation of the noise . ; And , well , it 's a little bit better but not
Bsr001_767	g	Yep . ; You get the wrong answer quicker basically , ; Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles . ; don't you ?
Bmr018_1048	aa	Could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ? ; That 's what he just said . ; That 's what he was saying . ; That 's what I just said .
Bed005_240	s	And , um ; you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ? ; Yeah , I mean I changed those sentences to make it , uh , more , uh , idiomatic . ; And , of course , you can have i many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine .
Bmr001_244	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; But I think that if my point is I guess if you if you have a um a uh s a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer , there clearly are ways to get more out of it . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1212	%--	Except right there . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , I guess So , from the point of view of
Btr001_121	aa	And also when you have the the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM then , you know , you @ @ in context you can tell which one it 's is probably likely to be the one that you had . ; but . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed009_489	s	I think the the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like ; and then what the action planner does with it ; and how that is uh specified . ; I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant .
Bmr020_1091	b	So . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bns001_280	b	I was thinking that um as a well , not really a UMTS service , but yesterday , what I discussed with Joachim was uh , a w little bit based on your ad - hoc networking also . ; That it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from w a WaveLAN Technology to , um , UMTS . ; I think that 's , uh , it 's in in the future that will be a main competitor of , uh , of UMTS , ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bro017_1220	cc	but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything . ; Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways . ; Hmm ! ; u s And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use .
Bed006_829	s	s Source it will be , ; you know we 'll f ; we know a lot about sources ; so we 'll put all of that in Source .
Bmr006_38	s	Um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data ; Yeah . ; and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , ; um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us ,
Bmr011_854	qw	So , um , um and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . ; Right . ; And he was , you know , very interested . ; And , " oh , and how 'd you handle this ? "
Bmr008_69	bk	So , go ahead . ; Oh oh , stats kind of status , OK . ; His ; Uh - huh . Yeah .
Bmr024_1310	s	Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations . ; Hmm . ; Uh , in this case four . ; Um , which Eh , we used to do only three ,
Bmr027_641	b	Respond to the email . Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . That would that would definitely work on me . ; Yeah .
Bns002_249	s	And if he does , what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission , ; and this will produce , at least at these two nodes , a collision or a m a m a a re a bad reception . ; OK ? ; So none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node .
Bmr005_296	bk	No , you have to say , you still don't know who " he " is , with that prosody . ; Ah . ; Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point . ; Oh .
Bmr021_462	ba	Mm - hmm . ; for like six meetings . ; So I think they 're split up even further . ; It 's kind of even more disorganized now
Btr002_844	s	Yeah . ; Interesting idea . ; I 'll I 'll s I 'll suggest that to the charer . ; Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go .
Bmr013_373	s	the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , ; i it 's all compromised , ; right , ; so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened .
Bro027_939	s	On the highly mismatch . ; Yeah , I ; Yeah . ; So , " highly mismatched condition " means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test .
Bed013_185	s	Which , if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent answer out of that , will give us the intention ex nihilo . ; And that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance , ; it would be b based on that extension , ex nihilo , ; which we don't know what it is ,
Bmr015_1113	s	and these things are somewhat self - aligning , ; so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a " breath " or a " breath - in " or " breath - out " , the models will learn that sort of thing . ; Uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are . ; OK . But that would maybe include a pause as well ,
Bed013_297	s	OK . ; I wanna do one of those things where I stay here . ; Cuz uh , if I go home , I can't finish it . ; I 've tried about five times so far , where I work for a while and then I 'm like , I 'm hungry .
Bmr027_482	cc	Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time . ; so that we can find a ; Yeah . ; Let me look at this again .
Bns002_1005	s	So ; the problem here is that now uh one node is my neighbor , ; and next second , it is not . ; So any route that was going through this neighbor now is is not possible
Bns002_735	s	and what we are doing is to transmit uh with the minimum power needed depending on the distance to the destination . ; OK ? ; Every transmission is supposed to be done to a certain neighbor node ; we cull the neighbors to these nodes which are uh closer than a given distance ,
Bed012_138	qw	No ; Yeah , exactly . The @ @ Xerxes allows you to say , u " Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . " ; But , we don't really know what we 're interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result . ; So the person said , um , " Where is X ? "
Bns002_600	b	So they can hear ; OK . ; If if if I can hear you , you can hear me . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1104	aa	Oh , much better . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed017_136	s	Like , a user class , a site class , and and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class . ; And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , ; so that I can actually um , look at it more . ; It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time .
Bmr013_606	s	No , cuz we need is really tight . ; Yeah . ; so , um , ; I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing .
Bmr016_935	s	Yeah . ; Then it 's fine . ; Right . ; But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on
Bmr012_1308	s	but to be basically in three parts , ; the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects ; um other things ; and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing
Buw001_487	s	w We have this collection of meeting . ; We have five hours of stuff . ; Uh , we get that transcribed . ; So now we have five hours of meetings
Bmr029_947	s	Uh ; No . He 's just gone to a SmartKom workshop . ; Oh . Oh , oh . Oh , OK . ; And so , we have now the SUN in the library which can do that .
Bmr008_371	s	O opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ? ; Yeah , right . ; That 's right . ; Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you
Bed005_1059	s	which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it . ; So ; right ? ; So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state .
Bed004_390	s	So , what ; Let 's slide back up again ; and see ; start at the at the bottom
Bro012_1095	%--	So if they have a better one , we should use it . ; I mean . ; You know ? ; it 's
Bro013_316	b	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , for sure we will do something for the special session . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_705	s	and see what happened with the the disks . ; He went to put those on a couple of weeks ago ; and something ; I think Markham 's out on vacation .
Bro027_1124	b	you just trained it straight away . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_572	b	I th I think that 's g that 's good . ; It 's the same as in the the smoother for the IBM thing . ; It combines them if it 's if the pause is longer than ; Yeah .
Bro005_926	b	So uh That 's ; Yeah . ; So . And and when you add other things in to to broaden it , it gets worse uh typically . ; Mmm .
Bro005_925	s	Yeah . ; So uh That 's ; Yeah . ; So . And and when you add other things in to to broaden it , it gets worse uh typically .
Bmr013_406	s	Right . ; Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , ; right . ; They overlap each other in weird ways .
Bmr006_671	b	I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . ; OK . ; Thank you for your information because I I read . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . ; Yeah .
Bed006_514	%	but ; Hmm . ; No it 's just um you know they 're coming for us so that we can bug them ; Ye
Bmr002_545	s	and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about ; I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk , ; Mm - hmm . ; is that is that you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that that , you know , disrupt the um the segment you know the segmentation .
Bed010_81	s	And send in a a a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works ; because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we 're doing it via mouse ,
Bmr007_471	s	I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth , ; But we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that . ; Yep . ; I could certainly see it going either way .
Bro023_727	ft	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Cool , ; thanks .
Bro010_446	%--	but I mean , ; e the argument was " let 's not have that be part of this test . " ; " Let 's let 's separate that out . " ; And so ,
Bed011_927	aa	right ? ; Right . ; And And so uh ; Sure .
Bro024_902	b	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh . ; Hmm .
Bmr009_786	b	Oh ! ; Oh good , OK . ; Um . ; Oh .
Bro014_1064	b	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; uh , sum the differences ? ; OK .
Bns002_1240	%--	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; You know , ; in the beginning , uh what w the
Bro005_635	s	kind of TRAP system , I mean , ; but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . ; Hmm . Um , yeah , ; and about multi - band ,
Bmr028_1157	aa	The pruning probably prunes everything out . ; You get out Switchboard . ; That 's just the lang the language model . ; Yeah . That 's right .
Bro005_476	ba	Perhaps , yeah . ; Well , that 's that 's one thing , ; but see the other thing is that , ; um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case ,
Bmr019_408	bk	To , uh , the to have have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation . ; But I think it 's an important data point , if you 're if ; Right . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1903	d	And if I get something , great . ; If I don't get something ; Who ? ; Landay or Jason ?
Bed017_492	ba	that can point you to the right reference . ; Right . ; I don't wanna compute the answer , ; so it 's a little bit easier for me .
Btr002_3238	bk	so when I find that I I note note it as , you know , finishing ; put capital letters . ; Capital letter , capital letter , colon , apostrophe " S " , utterance . ; Oh !
Bdb001_1355	s	And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between . ; Right . ; Yeah , exactly . ; But it could be that they just uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff ,
Bed005_108	s	OK . ; So much for the data , ; except that with Munich everything is fine now . ; They 're gonna transcribe .
Bmr031_1606	s	Mmm . ; It it it 's it 's sort of the first - order thing to do . ; There 's , uh , you know , uh , obviously much much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do . ; OK . So , that 's so that was our sort of
Bmr010_34	s	with reference to the cleanliness of the recordings . ; OK , transcription , uh , microphone issues ; And then maybe ask , th uh , these guys . ; The we have great great , uh , p steps forward in terms of the nonspeech - speech pre - segmenting of the signal .
Bed004_764	s	Um . In particular ; see what we 'd like to do , and and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use . ; So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff , that a lot of this is the same , for different tasks . ; And that uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting ,
Bmr008_1336	b	and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ? ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed011_311	%--	And ; I started to listen to one and it was just like , um , uh , sort of depressing . ; I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . ; And .
Bro017_1205	b	And then we also can send the the dis to the same address ; right , ; and it goes to everybody ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_539	b	But . ; Uh . About the same . ; It doesn't hurt . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_693	aa	Couple times . ; There 's more than one ? ; Yeah , we have two . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2646	s	Let 's see , ; I guess it would be ; it 's up there . ; It 's right here ,
Bed005_1507	aa	Mm - hmm . ; I was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't th see if they can handle it . ; Yep . ; Sure .
Bns002_1191	b	And uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies . ; You know , frequency hopping , uh two modes and and and also infrared . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_728	bk	Yeah , it 's already there . ; OK , ; Yeah . ; good .
Bro004_1088	no	It says " baseline ASP " . ; what ; is what is the difference between ASP and uh baseline over ? ; Yeah , I don't know .
Bdb001_82	s	Yeah , ; " T equals one point three two " , ; uh ; And then I I also had optional things like accuracy ,
Bro022_567	aa	SRI it 's it 's tr ; SRI . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_771	s	But suppose we dump out this file ; and we say , uh , for every word we just classify it as , w you know , rise or fall or neither ? ; OK . ; Well , in that case you would add that to this format
Bed015_581	s	An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , " what the space configuration is at the time of utterance " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so somebody 's gonna have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me , I think .
Bmr031_300	bk	Uh , Dave Gelbart . ; OK , maybe I 'll talk to him and see if he 's interested . ; Not right away . ; Yeah , certainly .
Bmr022_38	s	and then either ; Hmm . ; Inserted ones . ; And in this case only only had to remove beeps ,
Bed003_595	%--	Yeah , ; no ; wait . ; That that doesn't uh
Bed006_253	s	um ; " visit ; do some sightseeing " ; blah - blah - blah - blah - blah ,
Bmr011_1273	%--	or um , ; or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? ; No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . ; Or ?
Bed014_526	b	Is it is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever . ; Ri ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_546	s	One One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is ; So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . ; I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around ; and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks
Bro023_267	s	Yeah , ; so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , uh , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said .
Bro012_1230	s	But yeah , there 's there 's ; Mmm . ; Right . ; There 's all these cues .
Bns001_983	g	That 's the impression I get . ; That 's not the only thing . ; It 's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device . ; Right ?
Buw001_1860	s	Yeah . ; It 's a tape recorder . ; W We know it 's eight channels . ; Uh , we know it 's digital .
Bmr002_1451	aa	Yeah . ; Right . ; N You should have run it under your sweater , though . ; Right .
Bmr027_1302	s	If you 're if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive . ; So ; I think if I 'm ; But I I vacillate between no space free and a few gig free .
Bro003_939	s	Uh , not yet , ; but , uh , yeah , uh , e ; Yeah , ; it 's preparing .
Bed006_1215	%--	The uh ; These actions ; I don't know if I 'm gonna answer your question or not with this , ; but the categories inside of action schemas ,
Btr002_1920	ar	Are we OK ? ; so . ; Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think . ; No .
Bmr026_258	s	So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , ; Right . ; Right . ; but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do .
Btr002_3167	s	OK . ; and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative . ; And and sometimes ; So , if you have an " ER " as part of one of these fragments , we do have a lexicalized " er "
Bmr006_585	s	Wow . ; W w we are getting more space . ; We are getting , uh , another disk rack and and four thirty - six gigabyte disks . ; Uh so uh but that 's not gonna happen instantaneously .
Bro017_259	s	Hmm . ; but the truth is ; But you have many of those vectors per phoneme , ; Well , so you get many decisions .
Bro018_462	s	So i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , using um these set of acoustic events , then um that that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover a set of phones , ; at least found in TIMIT . ; Um so i it would be a a measure of " are we on the right track with with the the choices of our acoustic events " . ; Um , So that 's going on .
Bro011_242	x	um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh I also um haven't got the code yet , ; I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet .
Bmr009_1464	b	It doesn't have to be ex all at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have . ; Yep , just which one . ; I think that 's fine . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_902	%--	They ; I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers . ; OK . ; Uh , I don't know , it if if we want to uh
Bmr018_411	s	Uh - huh . ; And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it , ; Oh , oh . ; Visually .
Bmr012_1295	b	yeah . ; get them involved . ; Yeah . ; Great .
Bed017_505	b	Right . ; m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . ; So " this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux " or something like this . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_451	b	I need those back by the way . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro005_1323	s	And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . ; Um , but um , uh , ; we only have limited time ; and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at .
Bns001_363	s	Yeah , but if your s ; uh I believe everybody is aware about the USAIA architecture . ; And uh this one is , here , this stuff is , here , also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system . ; And in my conf uh considered end system , there is a certain kind of policy , concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things .
Bmr012_1200	s	Right . ; so right , ; so this is a good point , ; so yeah you have these these mikes with a little antenna on the end
Bmr020_1178	s	then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , ; which would be useful when it comes back to us . ; And um ; Oh also , at the same time she when she goes through this , she 'll be uh If there 's anything that was encoded as a pause , but really has something transcribable in it , then she 's going to uh , make a mark
Bro026_772	bk	You know Joe , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_900	aa	And uh , Jane had this nice , uh , idea of having , like an extra , uh couple tiers , ; An extra channel . ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bro007_364	aa	Mmm . ; that 's that 's that 's not proper ; but if this is development data we could still look at a couple . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1132	g	Hmm . Should be both , ; whereas maybe " where is X located " , we find from the data , is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is , ; and " how do I get to " is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there . ; Right ?
Bed009_294	%--	Yeah . ; the ; let 's let 's ; That w
Btr002_241	b	" That 'd be a problem , " ; whatever . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1185	aa	But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ? ; And I think that 's the one he was getting at . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed011_324	b	Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_225	s	Lawyers . ; And so I so I 'm I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh ; I am too . ; Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .
Bmr008_1634	b	Right . ; Right . ; But you 'll only know that in the re voiced regions ; Hmm .
Bed014_459	b	Can we ? Is it worth thinking of an example out of our tourism thing domain , that involves a a a decent mental space shift or setting up ; I think it is , ; but uh but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with " where is the Powder - Tower ? " or whatever ; Right .
Bns001_1113	%--	Mm - hmm . ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; So maybe I would like to ask Claudia ,
Bro023_23	qy	Oh . ; Hmm . ; Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ? ; Is that right ?
Bro019_911	s	Mm - hmm . ; So if if it is not positive definite , ; I mean it has a it 's ; It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite
Bmr029_834	s	So as long as we 're not using any testing data from ; No . But the thing is , if if we used if we used the whole training set for normalizations , then David would have to process much more data , ; Yeah . ; which That 's a that 's one bottleneck , for us
Bro026_432	%--	If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize . ; Right . ; Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize . ; But I I w w
Bmr003_2043	s	And th " that " being a diagram . ; What ? ; What ? ; That that 's the six tables that we 're looking at .
Bro023_1465	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , yep . ; Uh , and another thing is to
Bro016_780	%--	That means they 're between zero and one . ; Mm - hmm . ; But i it it it it doesn't necessarily ; You know , they could be ,
Bmr002_452	co	Well , that that was part of the question , ; is that if , for if we 're doing this regularly ; Right . ; Imagine we 're doing a couple of hours a week of transcripts
Bmr021_821	b	Um , so , one percent I would attribute to the lack of VTL , ; about one percent . ; Oh right . Right , right , right . ; OK .
Bed014_1380	b	So Anyway , to be to talk about later . ; Yeah , it has to in the sense that you 're gonna use them eventu ; it 's you know , it 's sort of a , um , generate and test kind of thing , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_343	%--	And I think there 's ; Well , what does H T K do for features ? ; Or does it even have a concept of features ? ; They ha it has its own
Bed015_1027	%--	what event happened . ; And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? ; Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , ; general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f
Bed016_318	ba	and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think . ; Oh . ; I was like , " where 'd you get that ? " ; Yeah , that looks familiar .
Bmr026_386	b	You we need about a gig per meeting . ; I 'm just saying he 's gone . ; I I thi ; Yep .
Bmr028_1072	2	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; We should at least get a first one . ; Something .
Bmr003_2464	bk	That I I don't think that 's gonna work . ; I see . ; So , I mean , either either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already in the group already owns , a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not not a disadvan or else we we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose . ; Yeah .
Bed015_756	b	that was my way of saying as opposed to , you know , " Oh , he didn't g " or " There was a meeting ? " ; I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2227	s	And , ; OK . ; so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing ; No I know I know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better .
Bed011_137	s	Something ? ; Yeah . ; And more and more every day . ; And um And they 're r ready uh to roll .
Bro019_1490	ar	So , it may be he needs more than me . ; Oh r ; oh . ; Oh no , no .
Bmr003_2519	s	As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , " can you talk a bit louder ? " ; I had ; Yeah . ; I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff
Bmr006_1560	s	Yeah , exactly . ; Doesn't matter if ; Uh . Um , yeah , I mean , t it doesn't I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , ; That 's the same thing you saw .
Btr001_2062	bk	Yeah . ; Exactly . ; Oh . ; Ah .
Bed015_1933	b	and other things we 'll put on a list of of research problems or something , ; because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done ; because every time you start to do something you say , " oh , yeah , but what about this case ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_299	b	But I I do remember ; Yeah . ; I 'll show you the point . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1747	s	I mean , ; Hmm . ; let 's put it this way . ; I mean , y you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters
Bmr028_1138	b	Reminds me of when th when Herve and I were first playing with c uh , context - dependent things for nets , ; and and at one point we took out the speech input , ; so we only had priors , and our performance went up . ; Mmm
Bmr014_687	%--	But certainly I wouldn't want a printout . ; These are big , ; and I would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it . ; You find it easier to go through a large
Bro012_1525	b	I thought " well if I only allow " ; Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis . ; Um . But . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_1830	b	so . ; I heard a " sh " . ; IBM . ; Yeah .
Bro022_337	bk	Nuh - huh . ; The mean . ; uh , r uh , then I don't see how that would make it louder . ; OK .
Bmr028_557	s	And I think wouldn't it be better to to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer ? ; B eh because of the language model ? As sometimes it happens that that it cuts off within a s ; Yeah . ; But two seconds is pretty long .
Bro024_393	s	Yeah , people do something . ; They they , uh , they have some , um , ; uh , ; in in cepstral mean subtraction , for short - term window analysis windows , as is usually done , you 're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic .
Bmr024_451	s	Right . ; and ; Yeah . ; Maybe the start of your speech and the end of it ,
Bmr016_401	co	Sixty - one . ; OK So but ; So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line . ; So you plu you plug your ears .
Bmr007_1212	b	And I use it 's it 's , uh it 's an A below middle C beep , ; I think the beep is a really good idea . ; It 's very clear . ; Yeah .
Bro023_815	%	but not much of improvement . ; I 'm just have some skeletons ready , ; need some more time for it . ; OK .
Bmr007_812	s	So there was a minimum run length , ; Every frame that 's over what threshold ? ; so that ; A threshold that you pick .
Bed014_940	s	so ; Yeah . @ @ That 's Me too . ; It doesn't matter . ; I 'm basically I 'm here .
Bmr026_1111	fa	No I mean it 's weird that it did ; Oh ! ; That 's what I said . ; I 'm sorry .
Bdb001_128	s	you know , so you could have some sort of type here , ; and then you could have , ; um ; the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that .
Bro021_1045	%--	And then if I apply exponential , to have here E ; Look . ; OK , ; so let 's
Bed002_941	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing . ; OK .
Bro014_679	s	well , from OGI , these experiments on putting VAD on the baseline . ; And these experiments also are using , uh , some kind of noise compensation , ; so spectral subtraction , ; and putting on - line normalization , um , just after this .
Bmr002_1075	s	Yeah , there you go . ; Exactly . ; They 're actually , they seem to be more ; the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles
Bmr014_742	b	Um , yeah , that 's true . ; Go ahead . ; I mean , cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to . ; Yeah .
Bed012_869	bd	As long as that 's O K . ; Um . ; I mean , I might slip out and say it accidentally . ; That 's all I 'm saying .
Bro024_1937	aa	So . ; And of course I 'd we 'd we 'd like to see it too . ; So , ; OK .
Bed003_1516	%--	Boston . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But
Bro028_126	s	where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the VAD network . ; Um , ; so apparently it looks better when , uh , we use the silence probability from the VAD network ; and we re - scale the other probabilities by one minus the silence probability .
Bed008_850	s	Yeah . ; OK just for starters ; and here discourse um ; For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say .
Bro005_462	%--	that gives eighty - seven point one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eighty - s ; I thought it was eighty
Bmr010_110	b	Yeah . ; where you have some kind of simple HMM ; and you 're testing the hypothesis that , uh , there is a change . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1394	%	Cha - ching . ; Ah . ; We 're gonna never recognize this meeting . ; OK .
Bro023_1484	ar	But this is ten frames plus plus ; Channel zero dropping . ; channel ; Uh , no ,
Bro015_20	s	That 's cool . ; There you go . ; Right . ; It will be some sometime in summer .
Bsr001_1823	b	No . ; If you doubt , don't do it . ; Cuz we 're very naturalistic here . ; Yeah .
Bro019_645	s	And it 's still slightly worse for well - matched . ; Um , ; But ; but this is not significant .
Buw001_60	%--	Sort of it ; you know . ; Yeah . ; Would it m
Bmr013_944	no	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Sure . ; And I just don't know ,
Bmr028_1719	b	Well , it 's even If y if you could still transcribe the words based on the far - field microphone or something , you could , uh , still use it for , say , language modeling , ; Is there a ? ; Far - field . ; Yeah .
Bro010_931	s	I mean , there 's no way , uh ; someone in the audience yesterday was asking , " well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , uh , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible .
Bed014_1432	s	What about What about DDR ? ; It 's almost true . ; Oh , I don't have it this weekend , ; so , tsk don't have to worry about that .
Bmr018_859	s	Right . ; I mean , that that would be really helpful . ; That was sort of another possibility . ; You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts ,
Btr002_64	%--	Whoa . ; Yeah . ; Wow ! ; I I
Buw001_1283	b	I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now . ; Yeah . ; But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , ; Mmm .
Bro022_110	s	Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . ; Look at ; then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . ; That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions .
Bed012_756	aa	And , Ami might . ; Ami might be here , ; and it 's possible that Nancy 'll be here ? ; Yep .
Buw001_1012	s	That 's right . ; Well , that 's the interesting thing , though . ; and wasn't ; If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently .
Bro004_770	s	ignoring the differences in context . ; That that 's true for the hybrid system , ; it 's true for a tandem system . ; So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores .
Bed017_48	h	and and probably won't have one next week , ; I think a number of people are gone . ; Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ? ; Um ,
Bmr005_1173	s	It 's three to four per week . ; So that 's what You know , that ; uh eight weeks , uh is ; So that 's not a lot of hours .
Bro003_620	aa	So , a a actually maybe now you 've got me sort of intrigued . ; What there 's ; Can you describe what what 's on the cube ? ; Yeah ,
Bro022_1128	s	eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff ; because the signal have different level of energy . ; Hmm ? ; And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS .
Bmr015_151	aa	I think the average was around four or five . ; So that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably . ; Wow . ; Yep .
Bmr029_353	b	and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone . ; And overlap or not . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_667	h	Uh , OK , @ @ So , uh , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , ; Uh - huh . ; so ; OK .
Bmr001_490	s	Absolutely . ; I mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk . ; Yeah . ; The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now .
Bed011_822	s	And the and the this used all over the place . ; Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um so the middle part is always sort of the the golden way ,
Bro007_292	b	I see . ; It 's only one small experiment to know what happened . ; To apply also to in include also the the silence of the MLP we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those . ; Yes .
Bed008_519	s	IE a a castle ; or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue ; Mm - hmm . ; you know can go inside .
Btr002_2107	bk	Oh , that 's funny . ; Um , not a te not a bad intrusion , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1856	b	d uh , it 's much better when you we used the clean derived LDA filter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Maybe you can do d also this . ; Yeah .
Bro017_304	s	Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract .
Bro021_1165	b	Well , for the noises I only use one Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and you and you train it up entirely from , uh , nonspeech sections in the test ? ; Hmm .
Bro018_568	g	and and they uh ; Yeah . ; Does there some kind of a distance metric that they use ; or how do they for cla what do they do for classification ?
Bro012_168	%--	Uh . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together um the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , I mean , ; Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , ; and also the um delay issue ; so that
Bed013_1179	s	There could be an interpretation that we don't have a node for in the ; I mean it just seems like @ @ has to have uh a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may . ; Versus uh , saying , this construction either can mean location or path . ; And , in this cas and since since it can mean either of those things , it would light both of those up .
Bed011_97	s	Got it . ; OK , fine . ; OK . ; The release form is over there in that box .
Bmr018_1099	s	you know , it was really a well presented and got people laughing ; Some good jokes in it ? ; Yeah . ; Especially the batteried meter popping up ,
Bns001_480	b	because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a w with what the user is is using . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_118	s	So you can say " run dash command L S " , ; and , um , it 'll actually export that LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . ; So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , ; and um And that 's a simple way to get started using using this .
Bro021_55	s	Yeah . ; Then , uh , whhh ; well , I 've been working on on t mainly on on - line normalization this week . ; Uh , I 've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches .
Bmr002_1302	b	Certainty , ; islands of certainty . ; Is that it ? ; OK .
Bro028_983	s	The method he uses is kind of funny ; is , um , he starts with he has a set of M of them . ; Um , ; he and then he uses that to classify
Bmr015_632	b	with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal , ; um , ; having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1929	s	No one owns the project . ; Yeah , I own the project ; but I don't wanna do it . ; No one wants to own the project .
Bsr001_1471	s	and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people . ; Oh . ; Um . ; So that will be different .
Bed014_275	s	I li ; I i ; Yeah . Well , it it 's fine . ; It was written by committee .
Buw001_2037	%--	because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , I just as as as a contributary
Bro025_202	s	So the issue is is , um , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ? ; Right . ; Um , what we 've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net , uh , to transform , um , all of the features that we use . ; So this is done early on .
Bmr002_1201	qy	Well , part ; It might be . ; I ; Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ?
Bmr005_599	bk	um eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone . ; Mm - hmm . ; But eh there isn't any any mark , time temporal mark , to to c eh to mmm e - heh , to label the beginning and the end of the of the ; OK .
Bsr001_1390	%	Right . ; Right . ; I mean , you were talking about the Penn ; and
Bmr011_537	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the ; But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction .
Bsr001_1794	bk	It 's not a speaker phone is it ? ; Don't don't switch mikes . ; Don't switch mikes . ; Oh , I 'm not allowed to .
Bmr011_1451	s	What he 'd said " no " to was for the main meeting . ; But they have several smaller meetings a week , ; So . ; and , uh , the notion was raised before that that could happen .
Bmr012_321	s	Oh OK ; so that 's ; Hmm . ; And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right
Btr002_2789	s	so , um , do you think that this has changed your speech n in other ways , ; in terms of ; Myself , I do feel that I 'm ; when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent .
Bro024_782	s	Yeah . ; And if we introduce now this this u spectral subtraction , or Wiener filtering stuff ; So , usually what you have is maybe , um ; I 'm I 'm showing now an envelope
Bro027_1242	s	they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . ; Roughly ? ; Uh - huh . ; They are a little bit better .
Bro012_1051	bk	It 's uh in June . ; the next uh ; In June . ; OK .
Bmr024_253	s	So . OK . ; Good . ; I 'm I 'm hiring people who , uh , really are ; They would like to do it full - time , several of these people .
Bro022_316	s	But I I was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data . ; I ; I b ; You didn't train it also .
Bed005_536	%--	We have @ @ simple " from objects " and " to objects " and so forth , ; points of interest along the way ; And , um , ; I asked them whether or not we could , um
Bro024_1546	bs	I think ; Then then I 'm confused . ; I thought ; you 're saying it doesn't depend on the utterance
Bed011_957	ar	OK . ; Um If you ; Is that roughly the equivalent of of what I 've seen in English or is it ; No , not at all .
Bro028_721	b	and then , ; uh , ; as part of the process of figuring out the scaling of these features , you know , if we 're gonna take it to a root or to a power or something , we have some back - end that we attach onto our features that sort of simulates what would be happening . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1024	%--	Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape with the current tape . ; I dunno what the these tapes ; uh , ; at some point these
Bed013_1009	%--	And so we can hard code " for opera , look for tickets , look for this , look for that , ; OK . ; OK . ; or look for Mozart , look for thi "
Bed015_887	s	Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture . ; Yeah , so b b but I think the poi ; I 'm not sure I understand ; but here 's what I th think is going on .
Bmr009_288	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Especially locally . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_203	bk	Oh OK . ; OK . ; And see what else there is here . ; Um Oh I see
Bmr009_1577	%--	Hmm ? ; So I I don't think it 'll be bad . ; So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people , ; and it 's likely that uh
Bmr016_1431	b	Eh ? ; " Eh , " yeah right , ; cuz there were were some speakers that did definite " eh 's " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_570	s	That 's a good idea . ; " I have to go now . ; You can talk to the computer . " ; It 's a lot more believable , too ,
Bro017_1307	s	Otherwise otherwise we t almost exclusively are working with uh PC 's now , with Intel . ; In that way Intel succeeded with us , because they gave us too many good machines for very little money or nothing . ; Yeah . ; So . So . So we run everything on Intel .
Bro008_10	%--	But , r our results from other other places , ; yeah . ; I I 'm sorry ? ; I didn't
Bro014_1329	%--	No , no , no . ; But th the kind of robustness to noise ; Oh ! ; So if if you take this frame , uh , from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance
Bdb001_1091	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ? ; Yeah ,
Bed008_439	co	are more likely to enter . ; So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ? ; You could , yeah . ; Yeah , so let 's do that .
Btr002_1045	%--	I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on
Bmr006_1528	s	OK . ; So uh , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says " So , Roger , what do you think ? " ; OK . ; Then , uh , it seems to me that Well , maybe I uh it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that .
Bmr010_675	s	and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on . ; But ; Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position . ; That 's what I was saying earlier ,
Bro014_972	b	but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version . ; Mm - hmm . ; And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_545	aa	Well I think the question is what the research is , ; so I mean , I presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here . ; Hmm . ; Right , yeah .
Btr002_1363	s	Oh . ; Mm - hmm . So actually we started with the words ; Yeah . ; and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds .
Bro028_1078	s	so so that , um , when you come up with these different things , and these different functions , you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector , ; but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth . ; And , um , um , um ; And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff ,
Bmr021_438	aa	That 's true . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , assuming you 'd Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original Switchboard files . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1139	s	And , um , ; then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel , ; or you can say that it was , um , a usurping of the turn , ; or you can you know , any any number of categories .
Bro011_103	b	Um . Yeah . ; And there again , yeah . ; For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , " we can try it but " ; Uh - huh .
Bed010_556	ba	OK . ; But um , I I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for for now , ; Yeah . ; but um definitely it 's interesting to look at at cross the bordered there .
Bmr009_1149	s	I mean there 's not a lot of r of room ; I 'd say , uh , " Boston , New York City , the South and Regular " . ; Well ; I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning .
Bns001_914	s	But nevertheless , it 's not the best for ; and and and and uh ; s networking stuff . ; You are right .
Bed013_540	s	What is our what 's our take home message . ; What what do we actually ; Because I mean , it I don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do . ; I mean , it 's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation ,
Bro017_1224	b	Just uh ; Mm - hmm . ; It might be a reasonable point for p perhaps uh start converging . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1246	bk	Uh ; I I I think it you know , another another bunch of digits . ; More data is good . ; OK .
Bro023_1178	s	Mm - hmm . ; yeah , ; if if it If you listen to it ; uh , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing .
Bed002_1205	x	Yeah , or you can split it up . ; So , y ; Hmm . ; So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to to for slides and whatever net you picked
Btr001_599	s	right ? ; And it was very hard to be precise about it , ; Um ; Overlaps .
Bmr015_170	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions ; Eight eight two two two nine . ; and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense
Bns002_517	s	If this node was transmitting before , it should uh it should ha uh transmit an RTS packet in advance , OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this node should hear it before .
Bns001_1331	qh	So my question is , what we want to do is ? ; Let 's assume that we have the funding . ; What will be our first and or or and second steps ? ; Ah , what kind of things uh we eh we will buy ,
Bed004_797	s	Could be . ; So . ; I 'm not a I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task , ; I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them .
Bmr013_109	%--	So if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble . ; Mm - hmm . ; So So the The point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but but real real situation , ; well , " real " ,
Bed016_307	s	and then maybe talk about the big picture here , ; e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story . ; I I wa I do wanna , um ; I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in ,
Bed005_1146	s	Right . ; Right ? ; So there 's no numbers . ; There 's just quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs .
Bmr030_459	bk	Yeah , but The easy way is ; Mmm . ; But w But we don't need to do that . ; Yeah . I know .
Bmr006_1462	aa	Well , it 's slightly different . So I I would say it would be a good idea . ; Cuz it it 's slightly different . ; Are they new ? ; Yep .
Bro024_1949	s	OK . ; Just just take a minute . ; I can send ; yet .
Bdb001_960	aa	so . ; Um , ; so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what , ; Sure .
Bmr024_1281	b	it can't be just the VTL , ; Uh - huh . ; because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features . ; No no .
Bdb001_382	b	I I don't know enough about what we 're gonna do with the data . ; But I thought it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding . ; And just , I mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_729	s	they were they were perturbed with me ; because I was breathing in instead of breathing out . ; And they had models for they they had Markov models for br breathing out ; but they didn't have them for breathing in .
Bro012_1043	s	And they are t ; I think they want to work on the second stream also , ; but more with some kind of multi - band ; or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP .
Bro021_1132	g	the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech . ; This only that . ; But the idea is that ; And the the model of clean speech is a codebook . Right ?
Bed005_1436	qh	and make your own " G function " , is what I was saying . ; Yeah , that 's fine ; if it 's if it comes only at the end . ; But suppose you want it embedded ?
Bmr002_1031	ba	So , Um , we 'll start with " Transcriber " ; and if it looks like that 's not gonna do what we need , we 'll move on to the Mississippi State ; and if it doesn't look like that 's going to work , we 'll look at something else . ; I like that very much ,
Bns003_931	s	But , you see the question is always " Where 's the money ? " ; and I say " Oh poo , ; currently I don't know . " ; The second question is how long I stay here
Bmr008_593	s	Right ? ; So , you could say " What region did you grow up in from these years ? " ; and have a set of circ of six or seven circles ; Yeah , that that 's good
Bro021_139	s	actu ; uh , well , at least with the current on - line normalization scheme . ; And ; we I think , we kind of know that normalizing C - one doesn't help with the current scheme .
Bro010_10	s	Uh ; Yesterday ; Uh ; Yesterday morning on video conference .
Bro013_263	t3	Yeah . ; So I think they were ; It 's not controlled at all , I mean . ; Bless you .
Btr002_838	aa	Right . ; Yeah . ; You know ? ; That 's true .
Bro007_457	aa	Yeah . ; and yeah . ; So we 're doing that also , I guess . ; Uh yeah .
Bmr011_1096	s	Got uh six sixty minutes of ; well even if you do it on something really long you need to know ; you can always chop it up ; but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , uh , chop .
Bdb001_951	b	Especially if there 's , e um you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right ; Oh , hi . ; Hi , Jane . ; Mmm .
Bed013_1091	s	Yea - Nnn ; Well actually more m more the other way around . ; We wanted something that represents uncertainty uh we in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is , for example . ; Some generic information .
Btr001_2148	aa	A couple people in particular do that , ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm , ; yeah .
Bmr025_1000	s	OK . ; Ordered ; Uh , well I 'm always gonna do that . ; W uh We ordered uh more wireless ,
Bed005_767	b	Right . ; O or or tower , or this tower , or that building , or ; Uniquely . ; hmm ?
Bmr011_367	bk	either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , ; Mm - hmm . ; and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , ; Right .
Bed011_1052	s	Right , exactly . ; Now it w we talked about this before , ; right . ; And I I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer ,
Bmr024_595	%--	Yeah . ; S ; No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ? ; We wer we just wanted to do
Bmr024_497	b	Yeah . ; We 'll see that . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns001_1409	s	It will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology . ; If somebody tell us , " OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . " How can I do it now ? ; So mmm ; I 'm still trying to you know , to get used to the uh all the ideas
Bmr020_958	b	Yeah . ; Sure . ; That 's what I just said , ; Sure .
Bed004_835	g	So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . ; And that may effect the way you process everything else . ; So if you say " how do I get into the castle " ; OK ,
Bmr022_1020	no	or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm 's length th so that you can see some display , ; or , uh , ; do we have one of these ; You know . I don't know .
Btr001_1279	ba	No . ; if I could be completely frank , I really didn't like the IBM ones . ; Yeah . ; Oh , good to know .
Bro022_228	s	uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh ; or pre - echoes , ; whichever they are ; are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .
Bmr023_114	bk	Right . ; Yeah . We 'd have to train . ; We 'd be like a chorus . ; OK .
Bmr018_571	s	unless our ; Well , Morgan and I were were having a debate about that . ; Whereas I think it it 's probably something pathologic ; and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that .
Bmr021_323	s	At least Feacalc doesn't . ; At least Feacalc doesn't . ; So . ; Well , that 's not a sound tool ,
Bed004_570	s	Yeah . ; This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some some form , ; and have this be in a in a in the content , ; loosely called " Constructicon " .
Bmr009_914	%--	so you really wanted to start with this other form . ; No , either way is fine ; I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to . ; Alright yeah , I was comparing
Bmr019_1769	%	Thank you very much . ; Eh , I I bring the chocolate , eh , to to tear , uh , with with you , ; Mmm . ; Ah .
Bro019_975	aa	Uh - huh . ; Well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried . ; Um , ; Uh - huh .
Bed005_1296	aa	Does this make sense to you ? ; So ; Bhask - ? ; Yeah .
Bmr011_165	s	Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working . ; The little the boxes under the table . ; Yeah . ; And so , w Uh , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working .
Bro014_162	s	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Hmm . ; So after I did that , then what I wanted to do was try increasing the number of mixtures ,
Bmr022_1447	s	Mm - hmm . ; It 's w it 's the checking in part that r we really care about , ; and that we can control with , you know , who can check things in and stuff . ; So we can I think we can do this .
Bmr001_443	b	I mean , you know , because cuz we 've got data on " user " , ; right ? ; And then we 'd have to back it all up and copy it back on again . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_520	s	We don't have enough . ; No . ; But it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects ; and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago .
Bro016_417	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; When when when do you leave again ? ; Uh , in July .
Bns002_470	bk	OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , @ @ . ; OK .
Bro017_942	2	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; But as a simple thing , you could just just muck with the variance . ; Just adjust the model ,
Bro010_169	bk	Uh , ; yeah , but then there 's ; plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . ; Oh .
Bed003_1703	b	Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which I think might be even better than us guys . ; Good . ; One of us , ; yeah .
Bmr012_1285	b	Yeah . ; Oh good . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed015_317	ba	Yeah . ; Right , right . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And I think that 's just fine .
Bns003_681	br	but it is this this is the w ; What ? ; They are not ; sorry ?
Bro021_1136	b	u ; Yeah . ; We have our codebook with different density Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2268	ba	Yeah , to me it 's like a vocal shrug . ; It 's ; Yeah . ; That 's a very nice characterization .
Bro014_1492	%--	Yeah , but ; Y ; Oh , no . ; We like we we 're we 're
Bdb001_159	s	Yeah , this ; I don't think I would do this for phone - level . ; Um ; I think for phone - level you want to use some sort of binary representation
Bmr008_1376	bk	like say , for example , the mean of the energy . ; Was that the idea ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed009_756	s	But the people at D F ; Yeah . ; People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers . ; Other you know , people over the years . uh have written various parsers at DFKI .
Bmr031_722	s	Oh . ; Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers . ; So . ; But he wants to go to new servers not just for us
Bed010_1111	aa	right ? ; Yeah , ; And we want them formalized and stuff like that . ; oh yeah .
Bed014_659	s	So one could well imagine , ; but not yet . ; Yeah . ; But I do th think that the It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override .
Bed002_295	aa	I I think ; It 's on ? ; OK , good . ; Yeah .
Bro028_814	aa	Yeah . ; So they had like ten quantiles ; and and they adjust the distribution . ; Right .
Bmr010_304	s	It 's called " trans transedit " I think . ; It 's a different one . ; I see . ; The the , uh the tool from from Susanne .
Bro027_110	aa	but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , uh , too , uh , low . ; Yeah , ; I mean , make it a hundred or so ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_135	s	Right . ; So , also , Andreas , on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head . ; And that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down as much . ; It is against my head .
Bed009_819	%--	What ? ; Yeah , it 's in in this direction . ; Hmm . ; The
Bns003_376	b	that 's the point . ; We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago . ; Uh , the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_362	s	I 'm missing that last word . ; Context ; K KLT . ; Oh . KLT .
Buw001_661	b	Yes , I agree . ; I agree . ; It 's i because discourse is about things , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1504	b	that was that was the idea . ; Yeah . ; Uh , but ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2589	2	Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what 's based on these ; Mm - hmm . ; and it would cost ; Peanuts .
Bmr008_571	s	And that would apply to everybody then ? ; Yeah . ; Just ; and It 's just the wording of it .
Bro010_417	s	So it would be on the ; um ; We was think ; on on the mel frequency bands ,
Btr001_896	s	and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project . ; But , um ; Certainly have spot checking . ; But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation .
Bmr025_183	s	Yeah . ; And then again , maybe not . ; So , uh ; Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable .
Bro014_1439	s	Mmm . ; What else ? ; Uh . Yeah , ; that 's all .
Bro025_309	b	Yeah . ; Dar ; Um . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1181	bk	But it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's I I ; Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_977	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So if you have very small variance you get really good scores when you get something that matches . ; Yeah . ; So . So that 's a way , yeah , yeah
Bed017_754	qy	um , ; I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , ; but it i it 's it 's interesting ; and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that .
Bmr014_561	b	Mm - hmm . ; I mean it 's probably more than that but but with of of non - digits . ; It 'd be more than that ; Yeah .
Bed009_1018	s	is it a bank ? ; Is it a s town square , ; is it a statue ? ; Whatever .
Bmr006_1755	s	And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . ; But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how
Bmr028_1622	s	Oh , I see . ; So , what are you gonna do ? ; I mean it will w the person if you 're looking up at the board and I disable the screensaver , you will see that the mike is off , ; but that doesn't necessarily help .
Bmr019_738	ba	So there 's I think there 's some issues about u ; We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . ; But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , ; and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model .
Btr001_1495	b	Yes , ; exactly . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_481	no	But but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students , ; and so forth , both at at UW and here . ; Are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ? ; Um , not clear yet .
Bns002_906	s	So ; But , again , uh , you know , uh the the m ; If you ask me " what what do you think what will happen , in the industry ? " ; What I think that will happen is that they will try to get uh mmm better hardware than we have now
Bro026_1052	s	Uh . ; Yeah , ; I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit ; I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive ,
Bns003_58	s	I doubt I don't know ; stop , ; and we 'll ; the first thing the most , eh , complicated is to fit them with the removal removable um , hard disk .
Bmr019_1768	b	But , eh , anyway , thank you . ; Thank you very much . ; Eh , I I bring the chocolate , eh , to to tear , uh , with with you , ; Mmm .
Bed015_500	b	Yeah . ; you know , where where it 's contextually dependent , ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_363	qw	Cuz I cuz it certainly always helped us before . ; So . ; Uh . ; What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ?
Bmr022_1383	s	Mm - hmm . ; But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong . ; Yeah , that 's a good point . ; Or overlooked or not overlooked .
Bdb001_1378	s	OK , ; Thanks thanks a lot . ; this is ; It 's really helpful .
Bed005_30	s	not necessarily by any means all students ; but we 'll s we 'll start with with that . ; In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script . ; And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon Uh , with uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out .
Bmr024_881	s	That was me . ; I was the one who said it was not reliable . ; OK . ; The - they they wear out .
Bro010_1250	%--	That could help though . ; So that ; Yeah , the ; the head , in the way , is really
Bmr020_1100	s	and I sent I sent email , ; So so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment ; so ; And I sent the path .
Bed014_283	s	Yeah . ; I think it 's uh ; Yeah , I didn't know about it until Robert told me , like , ; Yeah , I I ra I ran across it in I don't even know where ,
Bro004_1438	s	Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than this Aurora stuff , uh what do we do , large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem systems . ; Cuz we hadn't really done much with tandem systems for larger stuff . ; Cuz we had this one collaboration with CMU and we used SPHINX . ; Uh , we 're also gonna be collaborating with SRI
Bro019_220	s	Right . ; OK . ; So , ; I can get some documentation .
Btr001_1222	aa	Right . ; T ; Right , ; yeah ,
Bro023_726	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Cool ,
Bro012_418	bk	Yeah ; I mean ; but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . ; Oh . Oh , I see .
Bmr013_1025	s	Right . ; I said " For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown " . ; That 's right . ; However , he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed .
Bed004_895	aa	for example , is , you know , she actually m said you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff . ; Nuh ? ; So this is definitely interesting , and ; Yeah , right .
Bmr014_819	ar	there was this ; well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues . ; Good . ; No .
Bro023_401	bk	Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the , uh , Wiener filter plugged into it . ; But where 's the , uh , on - line normalization and so on ? ; Oh , ; OK .
Bed016_177	s	But for this it doesn't matter . ; But , uh ; We can talk about it later . ; That 's not even ready ,
Bns001_395	aa	And if so , then what Miguel mentions , then you add a certain kind of policy , to switch or not to switch , to this kind of technology , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Y Yes .
Bmr024_907	s	Yeah . ; and ; I mean , yeah , all the L ; I I don't know many people who do it on CD .
Bmr003_794	s	But , um ; I mean , it 's not bad ; But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . ; but it does take twice .
Bed016_194	co	There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . On page five . ; Interesting . ; Anyway . ; And y uh , email any time ,
Bro008_106	%--	Oh , wow . ; So so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I think
Bed014_1042	g	Here I 'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that I actually do have some stuff scheduled on Monday . ; Sure . Sounds great . ; Uh , so that 's the eighteenth . ; You guys will still remind me , right ?
Bro012_993	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um . Uh . Yeah . ; So yeah . ; And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction
Bed009_350	s	Yes . ; We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . ; Yep . ; But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said " OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop " in terms of querying about some of these decisions .
Bro014_941	s	Right . ; and and ; Right . ; m maybe there 's something there that the system can use .
Bmr022_872	t3	right ? ; And and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as , you know , ; and nobody will remember how to ; Another one just bit the dust .
Buw001_1162	s	And what ? ; I 'm at your disposal . ; um ; So , up to you .
Bro003_1645	aa	and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff , ; except for the Spanish . ; So I I guess I 'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk . ; Yeah , OK .
Bmr007_93	b	So , I used this mark and , um and , uh uh , divided the ; I wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes , of which we ended up with forty five , and a little bit . ; And , uh you know , minute zero , of course , is the first minute up to sixty seconds . ; OK .
Btr001_732	b	and I usually , um , you know , shrink it a bit ; Hmm . ; Shrink in them or whatever , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_492	s	Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . ; I 'd have to get started someplace . ; So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , ; I remember that ,
Bed014_1000	s	Well , I mean , the linguists ' meeting i happens to be at two , ; but I think that 's I mean . ; That should be relatively flexible be ; pretty flexible , I think .
Bed002_760	s	Um ; I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , that that will help us along those lines .
Bro005_1325	s	we only have limited time ; and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . ; Mmm . ; And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set
Bmr018_747	no	I didn't think so either . ; And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to ; so so there are some things available , ; and I don't know too much about this area
Bro005_792	%--	Mmm . ; uh ; Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . ; That 's that what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task
Bmr005_677	b	but eh I think we need eh eh more information . ; No , of course . ; I expect you to find more overlaps than than Jane ; Yeah .
Bmr012_278	%	S ; OK ; so that 's actually ; and it
Bmr023_732	b	Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than than Switchboard ; and there 's a lot less dropout , ; so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3351	%	this is again really rare , ; sometimes I 've run across the word " noise " . ; And offhand , I don't know if that 's a vocal noise or non - vocal noise . ; Mmm .
Bed003_839	%--	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the thing is ; OK , sh
Bmr003_519	aa	of course . ; That would be a meeting meeting meeting ? ; A meeting meeting meeting . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2946	s	and , um , wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things . ; These are , ; um ; Yeah , I don't think that these are very common .
Bmr012_177	s	Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who ; Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed ; and um you know separated used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used ; and uh Don sampled that so so eight K
Bro019_1360	b	trying to f ; to ; Moments , ; yeah .
Btr001_1267	aa	If ; but . ; No . ; Exactly .
Bed014_88	bk	Sure . ; Hmm . ; That 'd be weird , that he has both the Java Bayes and the embedded Bayes in ; Yeah .
Bmr014_789	s	and others do not . ; Yep . ; Others would consider it ; this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain .
Bro016_41	bk	Right . ; And , um , ; so I 've tried playing around a little bit with , um , the insertion penalties and things like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_789	2	And there are some general ; like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category . ; but it 's not ; It can't be relied on only .
Bro003_627	aa	to to talk about the whole cube ; Yeah . Yeah . ; and maybe we could sections in the cube for people to work on . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1197	s	So u s u ; OK . ; So So many tell you something about that . ; Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise .
Bmr019_548	aa	Right ? ; because that could be why the PDA is worse . ; Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits . ; It 's further away . Yeah .
Btr002_2895	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; all the way through the entire meeting ; and everyone was involved .
Bmr018_787	s	I haven't I ha just haven't had the time to , um , do the same procedure on one of the ; and ; so I would need a k I would need a channel that has a speaker whose who has a lot of overlap but s you know , is a non - lapel mike . ; And , um , where preferably , also there 's someone sitting next to them who talks a lot .
Bmr023_619	s	Yeah . ; We have eight meetings there ; because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings ; and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at
Bed010_247	b	It 's clear , then , I think . ; Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr010_871	aa	So are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ? ; Uh is it ? ; Huh . ; I think he 's right .
Bro021_1142	%--	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , ; how h
Bmr014_737	b	For the most frequent case they just say " it 's OK " ; and then they 're done . ; And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_108	s	I do , and the reason is because I think that um , well having been a grad student as , yeah , a as others here , at at Berkeley , that , um , I think there 's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status . ; OK . ; I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways , like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours . ; You know , in in my department it was always the case grad students had a huge amount of different priority ,
Bmr001_610	s	Well , but the @ @ There are two ways we could listen to it . ; There 's a sound there 's actually sound output built into this thing . ; Yeah . ; But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet .
Bed011_1118	ar	Ye - Right , but it 's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest . ; Yeah . ; No , we can w throw in an " Out of Film " construction if you want to , ; No , no , no .
Bmr028_307	s	Three weeks ? ; Tcl . ; Right ? ; Y I mean , John Osterhaut , uh Y you know , he started his own company based on Tcl stuff ,
Bmr003_769	qy	i a ; Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , l you know , good ; ar but ; Are are those d delays adjustable ?
Bed015_441	aa	And furthermore it 's well worth missing . ; Not in California . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Yes .
Bmr009_487	s	Yeah . ; Sure , but tone might be very ; So . ; Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different .
Bmr028_409	bd	That 's a compliment to you . ; He said it 's hard to find things you say wrong . ; Hmm . ; It 's hard to find anything that you say in these .
Bro021_489	aa	So , that 's ; I hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in July . ; So do you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among the the remaining ones ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_223	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; or some ; I mean it should have some policy like that anyway .
Bmr003_702	qy	No , it doesn't ; but what a super tool . ; It 's a great environment . ; But but is there anyway to to wire a speech recognizer up to it
Bmr003_2459	qy	The the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is is is a non - starter .
Bed003_1479	g	Yeah . ; and sort of ; Well . You seem to know better than we do so . ; yeah ?
Bed015_1628	s	Right . ; Right . ; But it 's not perceived as a quotative construction . ; I mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun ,
Bro017_591	b	Well , we have a document that explain a big part of the experiments , ; Necessary to to include the bi the bibliography . ; but ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_2214	aap	And plus the training , whatever you have . ; I guess , I mean , I don't know if we should talk about this now , or not , ; but I ; Well it 's just we 're missing tea .
Bro004_217	s	Oh yeah , the f Yeah , OK . ; Yeah . ; But uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent . ; So I was just I just trying to understand that .
Bmr016_818	%--	It just uses entropy coding ? ; So . ; OK . ; So , I mean , I guess my question would be is
Bed014_540	2	Right . ; OK , right . ; Right . ; Which one it is .
Bro011_322	qw	So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? ; I see . ; But that 's uh uh all that 's is a a certainly relevant uh study ; and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding .
Bmr020_1488	b	and other sorts of , uh , acoustic problems . ; And they may just guess at what those cut - off words are , ; They do already . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1435	%--	Ah ! ; So so that means the only thing ; So so so these numbers are simply ; This , we have to
Bmr024_32	b	The SmartKom data ? ; Yeah , right . ; Yeah . ; Uh , right .
Bro027_1960	%--	Hmm . ; Well ; Um ; So I won't be here for
Bed015_1397	s	Hmm . ; There 's almost I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . ; Yeah . ; So if I say , um , You know , " In France it 's like this " .
Bmr008_1696	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Is a problem to detect . ; Well , it 's sort of good , though , if you 're for for your accuracy .
Bmr008_208	b	So if if we can put something ; and Or maybe Post - doc change " Post - doc " to " PHD " ? ; Yeah , that then then I think what you have is great . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1315	bk	in terms of , like , consistency of conventions across a file , there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level . ; But I like b I like what Liz is saying about ; Well yeah , there would there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency . ; That 's right .
Bmr020_94	s	Um ; but ; Well yeah , you sent it in late . ; Yeah , I guess you first you have to do the first one ,
Bed004_542	s	Um , that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , ; that 's another sort of thing " OK , here 's a another kind of minimal uh way of tackling this " . ; Add extra properties , ; a deterministic rule for every property
Btr001_1972	cc	Uh - huh . ; I 'm just like , " I really like that person . ; You know what , ; I 'm gonna be his or her friend . "
Bmr002_300	b	Yeah . That would be m That would be my fault . ; and , in which case , I thank you . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro023_319	ar	So , I di i di ; So , does it g does that mean it gets worse ? ; Or ? ; No .
Bmr003_623	bk	I meant Joy . ; And so again , I have to say " are we recording " ; Oh , thank you . ; OK .
Bmr014_109	s	Let me ; That 'll be ; I think that 'll help ; I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done .
Bed016_935	s	Though , the one you have isn't quite ; You mean the s ; You mean " the steak wants to pay " ? ; N no not that one ,
Bed006_766	s	So in the future ; So it 's just an additional information ; Exactly . ; In the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description ,
Bmr003_1397	%	like fast forward . ; You know , like a joy stick ; or a uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that . ; Why , that 's
Bmr001_374	bk	OK . ; So , we 'll just have to see if that works . ; So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_357	cc	Um yeah I 'm starting to ; and ; um ; Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on .
Bdb001_186	%--	Right . ; Um , ; I 'm just ; what I 'm wondering is whether
Bmr031_267	s	You can separate it out and see how if they 're ; And then s s similarly with subject matter . ; Yeah . ; That , you know , if you 're training your language model on this meeting only and testing on this meeting only , you 're gonna do a lot better than if you start crossing them .
Bmr007_118	s	So , i it seems like it goes through bursts but , um that 's kind of it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Now , Another question is is there are there individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others .
Bmr028_380	ba	He 's overloaded . ; I won't say anything . ; I 'll just do it " . ; Great .
Bmr023_1198	s	Uh - huh . And i does it help ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , uh uh , in the Aurora thing .
Bed009_539	s	and s ; uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account . ; But One would have t have to see see the details . ; The specifics aren't really there yet .
Bmr015_1193	bd	well , let me see , it 'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it , ; but if there were , uh , like likely on the frontier , a good breath extractor ; then , um , and then you 'd have to ; But that 's a research question ,
Bmr011_472	b	And , uh , it is related to ours . ; They were interested in ours . ; They wanted to get some uniformity with us , uh , about the transcriptions and so on . ; Alright .
Bro019_269	%--	So . If you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , " no evict " , ; and it 'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from . ; So . ; Um , what what about
Bmr011_1760	bk	R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K ; because the t no one transcribed any words there ; and we throw it out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1446	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; nuh ? ; So you always send up " here I am I am this person , and I can have these parents "
Bmr001_818	%--	Yeah , by fixing up transcripts . ; So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like . ; Yeah , but Yeah . ; If it 's you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing ,
Bmr001_654	b	we talked out about what we 're ; Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is what is what eh OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we 're in a situation where we can with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording . ; OK . ; Right .
Bed005_913	s	there 's a particular piece of this big system , ; which , in German , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures . ; Right . ; And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that .
Bro007_223	qw	I don't know . ; What are what are the sizes of any of these sets , ; I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . ; So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?
Bed012_89	%--	and not - going - there and its posterior probability , ; because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the the a all the posterior probabilities for all the values . ; And then we would just look at the , eh , Struct that we wanna look at ; in terms of if if we 're only asking about one of the
Bed015_2234	bd	Fine . ; Four ? ; Yeah ; no , no , no , uh , I don't care .
Bmr012_677	%--	you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff , ; right ? ; U um ; From the outside world or
Bmr015_891	b	in the time . ; Eh , uh n the d ; I mean I I have two two algorithms . ; Right .
Bed005_133	qw	OK . ; Right . ; And um . ; What did you end up having to do ?
Bmr008_1716	s	because eh eh you are talking about eh the period or the the duration of the the window to eh the the long of the window to to consider normalization ; no ? ; Yeah , and I I ; But eh we have different contexts .
Bed006_803	s	The S Action - schemas basically have extra ; See we so those are schemas exist ; because in case we need extra information ; instead of just making it an attribute and which which is just one thing we we decided to make it 's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that that we need to exploit .
Bns003_131	%--	um On Friday when I installed , um uh Linux the first time I got access to the local network here , um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI . ; And , till Monday there 's no access at all to any machines , ; also not to inside machines . ; But then ,
Bsr001_357	s	Your telephone , ; aren't you ? ; I mean , no . ; and people use it for cell phones
Bed006_779	b	So um you had like an action schema and a Source - Path - Goal schema , ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_2164	s	Except there 's no no theorem prover involved . ; Best explanation . ; No , there isn't a theorem prover ; but there but but the , um , The cove the the P R Ms are like rules of inference
Bro025_285	2	or ? ; So it 's forty milliseconds plus , um , the rank ordering , ; which , uh , should be ; Like another ten frames .
Bsr001_2523	aa	And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway , ; drag them in here , ; and have them read digits for me . ; That 's right .
Bmr027_1089	s	I mean , I I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . ; OK , then you got , ; um , uh , ; instead of " from something - or - other cards " , it 's " for multicast " .
Buw001_1763	b	Well , um ; W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work ; Well ; uh , yeah .
Bmr022_1009	s	No , no , what I 'm saying is that we 're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure , d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot , ; or ; Demo . ; but it somehow connects to uh , remotely to this IRAM board
Bro010_1254	aa	that 's what it 's for . ; It 's basically , ; That 's what the head 's for ? ; Yeah ,
Bdb001_865	%	So , as opposed to ; But this is ; I I 'm still , um , not convinced that you can do much at all on the text on the flat file that that you know , the text representation . ; e
Bro012_76	%--	Did somebody notice it during your talk ? ; uh No . ; Huh . ; Well .
Bmr008_199	bk	just I 'm not a professor ; I 'm not a ; So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y ; oh , that 's right ,
Bro028_474	b	and uh ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_213	%--	You 'd have fainter ; Well , these ; Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ? ; Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ?
Bro027_1135	s	You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than ; Mm - hmm . ; Of that ; I mean , the SNR after the noise compensation of the SpeechDat - Car .
Bmr027_928	s	that we had a uh , uh ; I I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . ; Don't have it . ; But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable .
Bns001_527	%	Yes . ; And uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things si somehow similar to this . ; They worked together wi little bit with Nokia ? ; u
Bed011_916	s	so So , um In parallel , uh three things are going to happen . ; Uh Robert and Eva and Bhaskara are gonna actually build a belief - net that that , um , has CPT 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information . ; And Fey is going to start collecting data , ; and we 're gonna start thinking a about uh what constructions we want to elicit .
Bed002_577	s	i Go go back to the the uh , th ; Yeah , that slide . ; So I w this is " onto " is is knowledge about buildings , ; their opening times ,
Buw001_1722	aa	Absolutely . ; Yeah . ; You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . ; So , sure .
Bmr025_786	s	so . ; and and and put some kind of summary or something ; uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , ; not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important .
Buw001_1650	d	Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So then just email you ?
Bmr002_1177	b	Well , what the so , the reason we 're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we wanna back we want some something that will work . ; Well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr006_165	b	Yeah , then we 're completely gone . ; I 'm say I 'm saying fluency . ; It 's The the habits are already burnt in . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_189	s	Seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process , ; because not everything is displayed in that tree at once . ; Right ? ; Uh , no .
Bed003_321	b	although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net . ; Mm - hmm . ; But uh The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_268	qw	And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , ; um , I think they should be recorded instead of written ; because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . ; How about this idea ?
Btr001_475	b	But , I mean , I did find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot . ; I can imagine that , ; I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , " I can see how you how you couldn't understand that " , ; Hmm .
Bmr003_2030	ba	and it would fit right under the right under th the the the the lip , ; Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? ; yeah . ; It 's great .
Btr001_1562	b	You know , the n This is sort of just , you know , correcting other ; Yeah . ; I feel like I 'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_433	%--	But I think to to really work on on fine - tuning the report n at this point is is probably bad timing , I I think . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Well , we didn't
Bmr018_1529	s	and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines ; and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture , ; so , ; This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora .
Btr002_2311	s	Mm - hmm . The I agree . ; Or know about . ; Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is , certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other embed uh , in other utterances . ; And , um , you know , it 's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers ,
Bsr001_403	%--	But it 's that you get enough of the high frequencies . ; I mean if if you want something really really nonintrusive , really nonintrusive , really something that ; Yeah , ; that you really get you really get animals like
Bro022_324	bk	But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . ; Oh , I see . ; I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder . ; OK .
Bro012_776	qw	And the sentence contain only one word , which is " Due " ; And it can't clearly be seen . ; Where where is it ? ; Where is the word ?
Bmr022_1469	%--	and we 'll get two different corpora . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; I think we 're already gonna I mean there 's already some chance that different annotations , different places , you know
Bro019_206	%--	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; but uh , you can also
Bmr028_79	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I 'd like someone who 's more familiar with it to look at it ; because when I was looking at it , we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one 's saying anything . ; That 's just background speech .
Bro018_339	s	I don't know what that means . ; They have a constant in there , you said ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , at the front it says uh " log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two "
Btr001_163	%	Right . ; Yeah , ; o or I don't know . ; it 's
Bed017_611	b	But ; Right . ; Well I mean if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than work for some German company , or ; Yeah .
Bro019_1369	b	and ; pretty you know . ; But . ; Yep .
Bro003_514	b	That 's right . ; Well , especially when you go over the different languages again , ; because you 'd the different languages have different words for the different digits , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_2082	no	OK . ; Um , but e ; It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? ; I 'm not sure .
Bro018_468	s	Actually , let me ; Hold that thought . ; Yeah . ; Let me back up while we 're still on it .
Bmr003_2154	s	Well , OK , ; let me rephrase that . ; Why two each ? ; Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each .
Bns002_696	s	OK ? ; So the point we ha what we have done is to present a mechanism would pr which provides uh one uh value for a given uh mmm probability . ; OK ? ; So we can say that uh a given eh value are @ @ for for the transmission range , will be OK for a given number of nodes , if we Sorry . for a certain , for a certain probability .
Bro004_199	%--	No no no . ; Uh same language we are at uh for at English at O point eight . ; So it improves , compared to the baseline . ; But
Bmr010_225	b	It it works as well f with with without , uh , a LDA or something . ; OK . ; OK . No , I was j curious . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1350	s	Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be ; once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . ; I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . ; And uh and uh a nice amount of memory .
Bmr019_1004	b	but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you 're somehow involved in the topic , ; No , that 's really interesting . ; and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1065	s	which we know from the Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming . ; Yeah . ; And and you know , it took them I don't know how many months to do to get four hours . ; And so that hasn't been really our focus .
Bro019_1087	aa	Oh . You just take the Switchboard trained ? ; That 's that 's what we 're doing , ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Buw001_2286	bk	That 's great . ; Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . ; So we need a laugh detector . ; Yeah .
Buw001_211	qh	uh , u u ; So , actually there 's kind of three issues . ; There 's the CrossPad issue . ; Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?
Bed011_883	co	Yeah , now ob ; OK , ; I 'm sorry , ; go ahead ,
Bro021_1056	aa	This is X , inside . ; Mm - hmm . ; We have this , ; Right .
Bmr018_780	%	Yeah . ; but you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't . ; Right , exactly . ; so , so
Bed006_381	s	Yeah ? ; Mm - hmm . ; and then we can sort of this s instructor can say " well , uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here ; because this is where the shopping district is " .
Bmr031_180	h	How much ; How do you transcribe that ? ; How much do we need transcribed before it 's worth doing some trainings ? ; Oh . B uh
Bmr003_2392	s	It 's right there . ; Right . ; Right ? ; The antenna 's right there ,
Bmr003_1679	b	Oh , yeah . ; Yes . ; Which allows five . ; Right .
Bmr015_400	%--	And and we 're in the middle ; Mm - hmm . ; middle category . ; I think we 're ,
Bed002_104	bk	No , I I wasn't complaining , ; I just wanted to understand . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bro024_386	%--	OK . ; Yeah . ; Or subtract nothing . ; I mean , it 's
Bed003_113	%--	and " open to suggestions " , isn't actually a feature . ; It 's " We are open to suggestions . " ; Right . ; can I just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh , in this particular domain
Bro007_115	x	Yeah . ; But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty - two and ; Now up ; but
Buw001_2030	b	and different sizes . ; Fine . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . ; e e ; Yeah .
Bro027_1226	b	But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Mmm .
Bmr005_1189	s	But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester . ; so ; Right ? ; So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .
Bro011_373	%--	Hmm ! ; And then tell them to talk naturally ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Pierced tongues and
Bro007_217	b	Exc - except for the HM ; For many a mismatch it 's worse . ; but ; Yeah .
Bed008_697	bs	like the the more sort of you break it up ; like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential ; whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . ; So it yeah , there are two advantages .
Bed013_807	s	No . Sorry . ; We decided t that we 're gonna take a " where is something " question , ; and pretend we have parsed it , ; and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side .
Bns001_1417	%--	Now let 's proceed . ; What what kind of things we can buy , we can put together , we can program . ; Because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us " OK , did you do your homework ? ; Did you do what you
Bed017_756	b	but it i it 's it 's interesting ; and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . ; So anyway , that was that was today 's little story . ; Hmm .
Bed014_494	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So these are either true or false
Bro005_303	b	Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . ; We j jump to ninety percent . ; Nnn , we don't know exactly . ; Yeah .
Bro024_487	s	I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit . ; So I was like looking into " why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? " . ; Why why I was not getting it . ; And I found that , the noise estimation is a reason for the TI - digits to perform worse than the baseline .
Bmr003_363	s	Wow . ; So , do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future . ; Yeah , ; just get a variety .
Bed013_627	ba	He he decided I 'm chilling in the five - one - O . ; Cool , " cool Keith " . ; Yeah . ; Excellent .
Bro011_554	s	And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , ; this matrix where I would take the um the original um the original system . ; So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features ; and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again .
Bmr009_1488	s	It 's really great . ; But it 's hideously slow . ; So you this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches . ; The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down .
Btr001_687	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Um , I find that I have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway .
Bed010_1025	cc	Probably we 're connected to them . ; Right . ; Great . ; I 'll let you know .
Btr002_2425	s	I 've heard ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Which I just transcribe as " mouth " .
Bro027_462	s	So the previous syst ; It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . ; It 's the same system . ; The only thing that changed is the n a p eh a es the estimation of the silence probabilities .
Bro021_302	bk	Mm - hmm . ; To each of the mel filter bank . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed011_371	bk	How long will it be ? ; Um I I would say maybe two weeks . ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Btr001_120	aa	Just got better , ; And also when you have the the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM then , you know , you @ @ in context you can tell which one it 's is probably likely to be the one that you had . ; but . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_832	s	Me too . ; Oh ! ; Oh dear . ; But I am put I am putting the beginning of the meeting .
Bro012_1130	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah , well , not pitch , ; but to look at the um fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1623	%--	Uh - oh . ; Oh . ; OK . ; Well , you want to go first ? Or .
Bro027_765	s	Yeah . ; So , our , ; um ; Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car
Bmr014_776	s	I see . ; OK , well , if that 's what it said . ; And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l ; I 'm not a law lawyer ,
Bmr019_1726	aa	Yeah . ; It was good having you . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed016_110	s	Is ; One was rehearse your i i talk ; Oh yes , and that too . ; Not not rehearse ,
Bed013_1433	s	Fifty ? ; You 've had fifty so far , ; or ? ; No , we 're approaching twenty now .
Bed003_684	%--	I think we should have uh exponentially more middle nodes than features we 've extracted . ; OK . ; I 'm ju I 'm just jo ; So . Are " doing business " versus " tourist "
Bed005_1304	%--	So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to , either ; We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields , ; or some way to associate ; Or , w It may be that all we can do is , um , some of our own hash tables that it
Bro027_1288	g	uh , " Car " , I think , ; " Babble . " ; " Babble " , ; " Subway " , right ?
Bro025_371	b	So , ; Oh . ; uh , some people are lobbying lobbying to make it shorter . ; Hmm .
Bro024_1004	%--	u Uh , may ; Yeah , I mean , I talked to to uh , I ta Uh , I talked , uh , about it with with Hynek . ; I mean , there is ; This is
Bmr027_302	s	Uh ; Oh , OK . ; So what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? ; It doesn't have a time limit .
Bro028_965	s	um , which have a certain extent , um , in time and in frequency . ; And the idea is these are used to sample , um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . ; So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . ; And , um , that , um , is is interesting ,
Bro005_280	fa	so MFCC . ; Then we can use ; well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization ; Oh , I 'm sorry ,
Bro010_613	bk	not at the end . ; So ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , yeah ,
Bmr002_616	%--	Got a surprise . ; And um and they have you know , a lot of ; and MATE is a project which is being run out of Denmark ; and um they have a lot uh big uh , e
Bed017_192	s	And then , after you group them together this ; no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this . ; And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . ; Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff .
Bdb001_1319	%--	Sure . ; Yeah . ; But what if what if they change the words ? ; Not
Btr001_1999	no	Yeah , ; I just I start zoning out sometimes . ; Like , I don't mean to , ; but I 'm just kind of going , " I don't know what any of these acronyms are
Bed009_838	s	But But uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing . ; And uh I 'm not a big believer in this um statistical you know , cleaning up ; uh ; It That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way .
Btr001_1942	ba	Yes . ; and ; I th I think I know who you 're talking about . ; What a difference .
Bmr009_209	%--	Yeah . ; Interesting ; Here I I ; Oh that yeah that 's a good q
Bmr025_392	%--	but it it could potentially be in it . ; Could find some . ; Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers ; so I mean , you know ,
Bro010_1080	b	As long as you get The sequence , ; We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_188	s	I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows ; so i ; And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . ; So hopefully that will work .
Bed013_753	s	Well , you don't have t ; I mean the conference may be cognitive neural , ; doesn't mean that every paper has to be both . ; Yeah , and you can you can just point to the to the literature ,
Bmr013_382	b	Yeah . ; this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , ; So it 's like a continuum . ; Right .
Bmr023_1058	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Worth trying . ; But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now
Bed003_536	s	the argument in a sense ? ; Usually . ; I I don't know if that 's always the case ; I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have .
Bed006_1461	s	Mm - hmm . ; I I would just like to ask um like , if it could happen for next time , ; I mean , just beca cuz I 'm new ; and I don't really just I just don't know what to make of this
Bro007_80	bk	Yeah . ; Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ? ; Uh , no . ; OK .
Bro023_432	s	You have it ? ; Yep , ; it 's three point four , ; uh , eight point , uh , seven ,
Bmr011_55	s	I think ; Uh , uh , John Fiscus ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , I think George Doddington will be around as well .
Bro023_908	s	I mean , for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , um , at a particular point . ; And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is .
Bmr006_1166	s	Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess . ; You have a question . ; Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , ; but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA
Bmr002_388	b	Oh , super ! ; But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it . ; The other thing is is that we might be ; Oh .
Bmr007_203	s	um we know basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other ; so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be ; and so and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . ; No problem .
Bmr002_965	s	Cool . ; Yes , T " Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions . ; Yeah . ; It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . "
Bmr016_1788	s	Right . ; Right . ; There 's actually a bunch of cases like this with people 's names and ; So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are .
Bmr014_245	b	But uh , a as I said they 're coming in . ; Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally ; and ; Yeah .
Bed003_1688	s	We interviewed Fey , ; Mm - hmm . ; She 's willing to do it , ; meaning be the wizard for the data collection ,
Bed016_1028	s	um , ; I guess I could ask something like " Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah " ; in a sort of ; doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location ,
Bmr012_555	s	yeah . ; PZM ; and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said , you know one one or eleven ; and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL .
Bro005_290	s	Yeah . ; Alright . So this is I was thinking all this was worse . ; OK so this is all better ; because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two .
Bns003_734	s	Hmm ? No , ; not really sure . ; there . ; We 're not talking about to send the students here to I C
Bmr009_703	bk	OK . ; But that 'd be great if if you 're marking those ; and um . ; Great .
Bro005_627	s	discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , ; um , ; actually Hynek would like to see , ; perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band .
Bro018_987	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that , ; so you certainly could do that easily . ; But the fundamental difference ,
Bed011_516	s	And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense . ; And um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer . ; And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection . ; We 're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it .
Bed017_482	s	but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse . ; Mm - hmm . ; But maybe you guys had that in the previous models . ; Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer ,
Bmr001_657	qw	Right . ; Um . ; What are wh When are we Are we going to do that ? ; Who are they going to be ?
Bed005_214	s	playing ? ; Yeah . ; Tonight ? ; I changed that file , actually , where it 's on my account .
Bmr009_230	g	I mean , let 's start with the ; Before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is we 're arguing that if you take energy uh if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually there 'll be more energy than when one is ; Yeah . ; right ?
Bed004_657	s	I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention ; and ; the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time ; Well , you you could do that .
Bmr018_1015	s	Well , Ryan could come . ; Uh , no , that 's a good point , though , ; because for feature extraction like for prosody or something , I mean , the meetings we have now , ; it 's a good chunk of data
Bmr007_479	s	Wh - yeah , I I agree I agree with Adam . ; But yeah . ; Yeah . ; And the reason is because I think there 's a limit there 's an upper bound on how many you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility .
Bmr019_893	aa	Uh ; You mean on on the hand - marked , um ; So we we only r hav I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose , ; Yeah .
Bro010_119	%--	The low f f ; So that would be , uh , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , ; Yeah . ; which , uh
Bmr005_930	b	we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that , ; Yeah . ; and that seems to be a lot of overlap . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_753	%--	It must be It must be fundable then . ; " KCM file formats " , ; Oh , looks like Looks like uh work packages . ; This is the
Bmr012_460	s	Right . ; but we won't know ; because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech . ; It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech
Bmr020_1290	aa	But then we could just use the the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to I B ; Without having her check anything . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1179	s	I corrected it for a number of the words . ; um , ; I 'm sure that , um , they 're they 're accurate now . ; Uh , actually I have to to go .
Bmr028_724	bd	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Uh , just not during that time when it 's down . ; But that it should be down for an hour .
Bmr010_241	s	Uh we , um regarding the representation of overlaps , ; because at present , um , because of the limitations of th the interface we 're using , ; overlaps are , uh , not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and , uh , detailed a way as it might be , ; and as might be desired I think would be desired in the corpus ultimately .
Bmr025_996	s	OK . ; Oh , ; You 're you 're gonna tease me ? ; equipment .
Btr002_3354	s	Mmm . ; And so then I listen to it and I figure it out . ; But that 's the only place you would use a " vocal " " non - vocal " tag , ; where it 's potentially ambiguous between those two categories .
Btr001_98	s	and I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said , it 's probably best to put them in parentheses ; cuz I probably don't . ; That 's not a bad strategy . ; I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage
Bed008_1091	bk	Mm - hmm ; Now . ; Mm - hmm . ; Alright .
Bed015_1206	qh	That 's that one , right ? ; Yeah , exactly . Exactly . ; Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely , it is one way to for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . ; And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ?
Btr002_789	b	Yeah , you have to the resolution , ; right ? ; Yeah . Or , like ; Right .
Bro012_169	s	Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters , ; and also the um delay issue ; so that ; We considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization .
Bmr005_1163	s	Um , back on the data thing , ; so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have . ; We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed , ; we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,
Bro003_744	b	Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too . ; D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1297	b	Yeah . ; Great . ; Um that 's a great idea . ; Great .
Bmr027_479	s	But , I 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without having the the expert , uh , opinion on that . ; And how many people ? ; Then I think we had better find out , ; Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time .
Bmr031_241	%--	Right . ; Do y do we just give up on that ? ; Right . And actually the I was thinking about this ; the original application doesn't really appl
Bmr024_567	%	Yep . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's a good idea .
Btr002_2459	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , " mouth " is fine .
Bns002_1429	s	and um ; and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh use novel things ; and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network . ; On the other hand , in the internet backbone , uh we it is i impossible
Bmr014_46	b	Huh . ; And I don't know what the e electronics is but . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro016_1109	s	I think of the acoustic you know , phonetic features as being top - down . ; You know , you look at the phone ; and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature . ; Whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant .
Bed014_1164	bk	uh , uh , it 's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues , how they map onto this particular one , ; but ; Yeah . ; OK , yeah , understood .
Bmr005_1472	s	But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And u I think routinely they would not do this .
Bed017_435	s	and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against . ; So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs , ; and then I can compute how many documents match , ; and use this as a metric in the search .
Bro004_472	%--	and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this . ; Hmm . ; So . Uh Yeah . ; Well , What was is that i What was it that you had done last week when you showed
Bmr005_121	s	Yeah . ; So it 's , you know , not a matter of a ; Yeah . ; But , yeah , I think I think it was optimistic .
Bmr022_484	%--	Easy enough to figure out . ; Uh ; I don't know . ; So if there are in the in the hundreds and thou or thousands of these
Bed008_1375	%--	right , ; whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . ; So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , ; so what you can have is
Bed014_934	b	people people differ in their tastes in this matter . ; Yeah . ; I I 'm neutral . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1563	s	It 's just no ; But ; No , but there was still a spread . ; So they 're all approaching .
Buw001_1363	s	Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; W we just need to start somewhere .
Bmr008_614	%--	so it 's ; so the idea again was , you know , you might wanna also know if if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up ; and so uh , I think you wanna The idea the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might um ; you know , if you say your native language was was English but uh you you grew up in Germany , uh I think this
Bmr013_137	qw	I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . ; What do you mean , the prosodics ?
Bmr008_245	b	Someone who 's just gotten their PHD uh , could be very very uh , strongly opinionated about something and somebody who 's been twenty years out could be shy , you know , s ; So , maybe Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD and Other ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_87	b	No . I the audio file you can specify any sampling rate . ; Or ? ; And so I s I specified instead of , you know , sixteen thousand or eight thousand , I specified a hundred . ; Mmm .
Bro027_2022	t1	Uh , I won't ; it 's probably four because of ; is it three ? ; Let 's see ,
Bed003_1728	b	you know , set up as ; I know . ; That 's probably a good enough test of ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_86	b	Yeah ; Why , ; and so forth . ; yeah .
Bed004_228	s	Hmm . ; So i if ; Yeah , I agree , ; she sounded fine ,
Bmr029_708	b	I think Markham 's out on vacation . ; I think , che check with Dave . ; Oh , OK . I 'll ask David , then . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1622	b	But that the other four should build a service on top of it , that has a clear business focus . ; mm - hmm . ; It means eh a a UMTS service basically . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_459	%--	Forty - five minutes for that one . ; More beeps than that . ; I was thinking there was on the order of fifteen hundred segments , ; but maybe I 'm
Bmr019_761	s	But then the background speech was also a reject model , ; and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between ; you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . ; So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .
Bro003_1316	b	it 's actually finer class , ; but you mean y You mean more classes . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed015_1350	aa	e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? ; You know , like " Naomi wants wants su a certain situation ; and that situation itself is a state of affairs " . ; S right .
Btr001_2264	b	but I don't know , ; so . " ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr031_320	%--	Probably somebody from UW . ; Um . So . ; Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people . ; But but I think , you know , the main thing is just to ,
Bed009_493	%--	Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention . ; And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be . ; Mm - hmm . ; But um the internal workings of of the
Bed012_588	s	I can't figure out how to get the probabilities into it . ; Like , I 'd look at ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's somewha It 's boggling me .
Bmr031_720	s	Mm - hmm . ; because that takes about a day to get off back - up tape . ; Oh . ; Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers .
Bmr003_2319	bk	No , but w certainly one of the issues is is the , uh is security . ; Hmm ? ; I mean , we 've been been been lax and lucky . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1304	%--	one has voted for V , ; and one has voted for E , ; so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four ; and similarly , probability of
Bed016_966	s	But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . ; Ellipsis . ; Huh . ; Like , " it " doesn't refer to " thing , "
Bro011_644	s	i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . ; I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models ; and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of ; just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening .
Bro012_869	b	because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B ; Mm - hmm . ; if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bro023_745	s	And ; So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate ; but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames . ; So I 'm not still not estimating .
Bsr001_1380	s	Right . ; But I mean I u u as long as that makes sense , then it 's nice to have a variety of tasks , right ? ; To have sort of , you know , different ; Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar .
Bmr002_1422	s	I mean I feel like it 's all quite normal . ; OK . ; Good . ; Well , I hear what you 're saying .
Bed016_903	%--	No , no . The question is d do you wanna do you wanna construe do you wanna constr - strue ; Sh ; It 's a speech - act . ; r
Bro028_1089	s	and branch out branch out from there . ; And his advisor is here , too , at the same time . ; So , ; he 'll be another interesting source of wisdom .
Bmr014_1042	s	That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around . ; that 's right . ; And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you , ; or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything .
Bro004_1075	no	set . ; So that 's a good question . ; Where does it come from ? ; Yeah , I don't know .
Bmr011_1294	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , ; and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . ; Hmm .
Bed013_1154	qw	and from the construction also you know that it is a location ; is or a thing thing that can be located . ; Right ? Ontology says this thing has a location slot . ; Sh - and that 's the thing that is being that is the content of the question that 's being queried by one interpretation of " where is X " .
Bmr008_1062	ft	It 's the age question again . ; Your mother 's maiden name mother 's maiden name ; Oh , I see . ; Then , you don't hafta ask the age .
Bed015_735	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . ; So that 's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing .
Bro028_189	s	Um ; Yeah . The next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data . ; Um ; So , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources .
Bed013_1076	b	We decided sort of the the prototypical " where is X " , where you know , we don't really know , does he wanna go there , or just wanna know where it is . ; Well we were ; So the difference of " where is the railway station " , versus where where " where is Greenland " . Nuh ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_996	b	Right . ; So again , information structure has a topic slot . ; And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1329	b	I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together . ; I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall . ; But given the limitation in time and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists doing this sort of thing , ; Yeah .
Bmr021_310	%--	because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools . ; So . ; Y uh , I guess , ; but it
Bro019_1274	s	and let the ; But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , ; maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . ; But , maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you .
Bmr012_1092	aa	It 's a lot of money for a handband . ; OK ; and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1929	bk	but ; which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway . ; It 's written in unification grammar framework . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1120	s	They k uh ; after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the the training set of TIMIT after clean s after you do the noise clean - up . ; Mmm . ; I mean , earlier you never had any compensation ,
Bmr005_478	b	Uh silent , ; I I I I don't I I haven't the ; eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study ; Yeah .
Bmr030_765	ba	And each meeting is roughly half a gig , ; Half . ; and so . ; So that means we 're p getting pretty close .
Bmr013_554	s	These k No , I 'm serious . ; There are all these kinds of functional , uh , elements . ; I don't know what you call them . ; But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth .
Bns003_727	s	Mm - hmm . ; If you don't have , a research project well , you cannot pay them ; so u u usually you don't have anybody . ; So it 's kind of , uh , dependent on the funding we have in some projects .
Bro014_611	s	Yeah . ; And you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove improve recognition . ; But it seems like you should do both . ; They may not be the same thing .
Buw001_497	s	And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it serves two purpo purposes . ; One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,
Bro017_1310	%--	So . So . So we run everything on Intel . ; Wow ! ; Hmm . ; And
Btr002_2339	s	Yeah . ; So , and then of course there are these these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data ; which are these funny sounds people make , ; which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk .
Bdb001_1179	qw	And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version . ; OK ? ; Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on , uh well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know , ; um , what was it ?
Bro004_166	b	and , well Around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . ; Ab - about how much ? ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro018_770	s	So King and and Taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural nets , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and this i their their idea was to first find a mapping from MFCC 's to uh phonological features
Bed015_623	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , right , right , right . ; Um , for now I 'm gonna say like " profile " 's often used ; like two uses that come to mind immediately .
Buw001_1497	%	you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha ; Hmm . ; You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people . ; Yep .
Bmr005_175	ba	So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again . ; I believe it . ; Yeah . Actually to make it worse , uh , Morgan uses " you " and " you " ; So this is this is this is gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .
Bed009_215	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; And so what uh uh a s you s ; let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants .
Bmr024_962	%--	and and occasionally you might need to recreate one , ; and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't . ; Can't you just ; you just put them on ?
Bed009_546	%--	So anyway , Robert , that 's why I was thinking that ; Mm - hmm . ; um ; I think you 're gonna need
Bmr031_1413	b	has this sort of general framework for a for it ; so that you can adjust it to sort of an any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_198	s	Uh , if it 's on the server side , it you probably don't have to worry too much about size . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's kind of an argument for that . ; We do still , however , have to consider its latency .
Bmr027_1167	b	They 're not headsets . ; They 're not microphones . ; No , no . I mean , just earphones ? ; Right .
Bro018_903	s	Uh - huh . ; and it looks like we don't have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis . ; We basically it looks to me like we do the FFT , um and then we just take all the bins ; and we use everything .
Bro016_723	s	um , ; when they are used on on the SpeechDat - Car data , it 's not the case ; oh , well . ; The MSG features are much worse ,
Btr002_1369	s	Right . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then there was some conversation in addition , that that , um , needed to be transcribed .
Bsr001_2379	b	Oh right . ; I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_22	b	So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings . ; I see . ; They don't work for me very well . ; That 's right .
Bmr002_1035	b	and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with these larger corp corpus projects . ; OK . ; So that , you know , the fact that , yeah , it 's U Penn and all that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1199	x	Right . ; But um , maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , ; and what it does , and how it does that . ; Well , y Well , or both of them speak .
Bmr006_55	b	so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . ; Great . ; Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . ; Right .
Bmr012_236	%--	but that that will be completely gone if this synch time problem ; The the glitch ; So so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to ; And the only glitch
Bmr008_1560	b	eh , I I ; It has to tell you . ; It has to give you at least a zero , one , ; Yeah .
Bns003_876	b	Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1155	co	Yeah . Yeah . ; That 's a joke . ; That 's ; So let 's make it up .
Bmr007_719	s	I 'll do that . ; Yeah . ; I 'll do that on the next set of forms . ; So you 'd number them somehow .
Bmr024_112	s	Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , ; and so it just goes " beep one beep " and then the phrase , ; and then " beep two beep " and then the phrase . ; And that seems pretty good .
Bro010_353	s	Uh , yeah . ; yeah . ; And , uh , ; Also we were thinking to to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson
Bmr031_1060	s	Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load . ; So when you have a big meeting it c uh , especially on a slower machine , it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so I was thinking about why that was
Bro018_897	s	You had the sa same answer anyway . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I 've been um , I 've been working with um Jeremy on his project ; and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features .
Bns003_835	fa	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , ; I would like to have it . ; Sorry .
Buw001_1646	s	But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . ; But I think all he would want is the digits . ; Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . ; I 'm interested in getting the language model data .
Bmr008_1482	b	hamming window . ; Something , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1858	b	and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony ; Yeah . ; N no . ; Mmm .
Bro023_717	s	yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . ; VA Yeah , VAD . ; w Yeah . ; So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them .
Bmr009_243	s	You have the silence , and that that 's fine . ; Yeah . ; So , uh with three colors or three shades or whatever , ; just just look at those distributions .
Btr001_60	aa	You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was . ; So . ; Parentheses , meaning uncertainty . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1214	s	And I don't know if , um ; where that i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , ; sort of like a , um ; it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff ,
Bsr001_656	%--	That that was daring . ; The PDA one is very , very ambitious . ; Yeah . ; And it 's also it 's depending on not only that
Bro024_132	b	I mean , a short - time FFT short - time cepstrum calculation , uh , mean u mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems , they do this all the time . ; They the they calculate it from previous utterances and then use it , you know . ; Yeah , ; um .
Bro026_1086	co	Should we do some digits ? ; Yeah . ; Since we 're here ? ; Go ahead , Morgan .
Bro012_1286	%--	Yeah . ; then that would that would I guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information . ; So maybe that 's what you meant . ; And then that would be
Bro005_470	b	OK . ; Is th is that right ? ; Yeah ? ; Yeah .
Bro013_393	ba	Yeah . ; You know , as long as it did the job . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's good .
Bro004_692	s	Mmm . There were other minor differences , ; the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , ; and that she used C - zero instead of log energy . ; Uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion .
Bro016_630	%--	Could be expensive . ; I mean ; Yeah . ; No .
Bed017_415	s	So . ; And I think that I don't need to tell you this . ; I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context ; it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference .
Btr001_2553	s	it should be channel so - and - so " . ; And then it turned out it was channel so - and - so ; which he said , ; and and she said he s he said , " I bested you again Nancy " .
Bed017_304	aa	So , uh , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch ; and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work ; and ; Yep .
Bro011_588	s	And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . ; So my guess uh ; And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the well - matched case , ; and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best .
Bmr005_398	bk	For me is the overlapping zone , ; because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment . ; So i if two or more people are talking . ; I see .
Bmr018_1697	qh	Yeah . ; I mean , so . ; And I 'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition , ; right ?
Bmr012_314	g	There was ; Where where they weren't monotonic . ; yeah , I mean ; right ?
Bdb001_1235	%--	Right , right . ; Right . ; So . ; So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by , uh , doing uh , by doing Hhh .
Bed005_537	%--	points of interest along the way ; And , um , ; I asked them whether or not we could , um ; First of all , I was little bit
Bro012_437	bk	So . ; Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match ; and ; yeah .
Bmr014_735	s	Well , no fre for the most ; we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people ; For the most frequent case they just say " it 's OK " ; and then they 're done .
Btr002_3072	%--	Oh yeah I I was ; She 's pretty darn sure that , uh , ; Ah and then tha Yeah , that 's wha ; You sh
Bed003_709	aa	wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr020_807	%--	OK . ; Just to check which w if there is a significant difference . ; And so I ; but
Buw001_656	2	I don't mean that you model it . ; Just just in terms of ; We should just ; Like archiving it or storing it .
Bro019_445	ar	Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ? ; Uh ; Or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ? ; No .
Bed015_1590	b	Right , it was a space builder . ; Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces ; because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_205	ft	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK , ; thanks .
Bmr014_889	s	Mm - hmm . ; You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , ; Yeah . ; but it might be , uh it might be really a a pain .
Bro017_67	s	Yeah ; well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . ; We never uh uh denied that . ; We thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent then you negotiate , or something ,
Bmr023_213	aa	So . ; Right . ; There 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done . ; Yeah .
Bro004_238	d	Uh , more actually . ; One point four ? ; If I Yeah . ; So , it 's an additional thirty percent .
Bmr016_126	s	Right . ; So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " . ; Right . Right , read them as single digits , ; so sixty - one w is read as six one ,
Bmr029_691	s	That 's that 's how I 've been doing it , ; just by concatenating files together . ; Um , and if these files and the ; since they 're individual utterance files , um , s long silence periods are removed ,
Bed010_704	cc	Or a link to it . ; It 's called " An Anatomy of a Spatial Description " . ; Just ; But I 'll send that link .
Bro022_842	b	I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , um , energy - based VAD that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . ; Um . ; So , which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_687	bk	So . Are " doing business " versus " tourist " ; They refer to your current task . ; Like like current thing you want to do at this moment . ; Um . Yeah ,
Bed013_20	b	OK , I 'm flying to Sicily basically to drop off Simon there with his grandparents . ; And then I 'm flying to Germany t to go to a MOKU - Treffen ; which is the meeting of all the module - responsible people in SmartKom , ; Mmm .
Bed014_895	%--	Usually he has no real constraints . ; So ; And the NTL meeting moved to Wednesday , ; cuz of of , uh
Bmr014_282	s	And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those . ; Mm - hmm . ; So he has a nice set up that they ; it w it will be efficient for them to do that .
Btr002_324	s	but you don't always y ; these things are correlated but they 're not perfect . ; Yeah . ; That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up ,
Bdb001_600	s	Well , channel or speaker or whatever . ; yeah , channel is what the channelized output out ; It doesn't ; This isn't quite right .
Bro021_1032	ar	oh . ; Right ? ; Cuz you cuz you up here you have the A plus B ; No .
Bmr014_412	b	You know , the spell - check basically does that ; but but in addition ; yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_845	s	I used it in Transcriber ; U uh ; and it 's it 's in the ; well , Jane and I were just in terms of the tool , talking about this .
Bro005_289	bs	OK . Alright . ; Yeah . ; Alright . So this is I was thinking all this was worse . ; OK so this is all better
Bsr001_618	s	Yeah . ; What 's your project ? ; Well , basically , the the the original project looks a lot like , you know , the the p your project . ; I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , idea of the the the meeting the the mediated spaces idea in general
Bro007_370	b	Sure . ; But we have to decide ; I mean we have to fix the system on this d on this data , to choose the best ; Yeah .
Bsr001_799	s	Huh . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; And he has a very good system for that ; and and he wants to use this corpus .
Bns002_1000	s	on these networks ; And eh well some day in the future eh , a protocol should be chosen ; but , for the moment eh we have several of them on the table . ; and eh any protocol has some advantages and some disadvantages .
Bed006_494	b	April twenty - sixth to the May fourth ? ; Yeah , something like that . ; I 'll probably be here . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_668	b	we haven't done this yet because , um , uh , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . ; i basically I ran out of machines at SRI , ; cuz we 're running the evals ; OK .
Bed005_847	%	Right . No , I think that 's one of things that 's interesting , ; Yeah . ; is is in this sort of over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1400	s	So if I say , um , You know , " In France it 's like this " . ; You know , great , ; we 've learned something about France ; but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast ,
Bmr028_390	b	So . ; And it 's it 's case insensitive ? ; Correct . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_115	bk	Or Saturday ? ; Saturday . ; Saturday . ; OK .
Bmr023_341	s	Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting . ; Yeah , but still . I mean , I d it 's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got , uh , ; No backs . ; two of the ones who who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours ,
Bro010_747	%--	I don't know . ; But what you 're saying , you know , makes sense , though . ; I mean , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , uh , the center of the center of the window . ; But
Bro024_1437	bk	So so so these numbers are simply ; This , we have to ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_714	s	Mm - hmm . ; And um that 's all done um by the script , ; and it works great . ; And uh I first trained up two systems ,
Bro024_1797	s	Carmen ? ; Do you , uh ; Well , I only say that the this is , a summary of the of all the VTS experiments ; and say that the result in the last um , for Italian the last experiment for Italian , are bad .
Bmr016_1712	s	Where do you see that ? ; Uh ; Oh , oh . ; The reason is because w it was said " tickle " .
Bed011_199	b	so that d d That , um in terms of the linguistics and stuff , there may be a few different kinds of places , ; so I th i it seems to me that We ought to decide you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us . ; And um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . Um are all big - ish things that um you know have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine . ; Hmm .
Buw001_72	b	It 's kind of ; Oh , yeah , the element , ; yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1387	s	Yes . ; and and you 're saying about the Spanish ? ; The Spanish labels ? ; That was in different format ,
Bed013_132	s	eee , I think even think even ; What it would be the the prior intention . ; So let 's uh uh , let 's say we have this ; Well we 'd have to seed that ,
Bns002_1430	s	and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh use novel things ; and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network . ; On the other hand , in the internet backbone , uh we it is i impossible ; and we see it on several examples
Bmr021_18	s	I do . ; I l I think I find them very comfortable . ; Yeah , I do too . ; Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape .
Bed004_151	s	The reading needs to be shorter . ; Five minutes is just too long . ; Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order . ; And uh she did not .
Buw001_1273	s	Yeah . ; Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? ; and then ; Yeah . That 's why I was wondering .
Btr002_117	b	but it was really " with age " . ; Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr007_740	s	Beam - forming during the digit uh stuff . ; So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a good idea .
Bmr020_1151	s	And it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , ; we had some discussion over the weekend a about at at this other meeting that we were all a at ; um , about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . ; And um , in in a way , by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel .
Btr002_2261	b	u all these different in ; cuz , you know , I mean , we do that all the time with all other well , lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro021_658	s	So you have to do some scaling . ; But that 's not a big deal ; cuz it 's the log of of K times a complex number , ; then you can just that 's the same as log of K plus log of the complex number .
Bmr027_352	s	Well , then ; No . ; It we 're hoping that doesn't happen , ; but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail
Btr002_1769	b	It 's just it 's just kind of cute ; because everybody 's like , " Oh . Well , OK . " ; And they 'll just listen to you , you know . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1214	s	Alright , which is ; So it makes sense ; um ; Skolemization .
Bsr001_379	s	Wow , that 's amazing ! ; I ; I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way . Still , I I I mean , I 'm ; Get a very high pitch that way too .
Bed014_1335	bk	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know . ; OK . Good .
Bns001_1405	fa	the difficulty I see is that ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology . ; Which is not bad , ; but uh , I 'm just saying that it will be able It will ; Sorry .
Bmr018_180	cc	Yeah , maybe it doesn't matter . ; Great . ; I I don't think it matte ; I 'll I 'll I 'll , um , get make that available .
Bro005_1136	s	I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . ; That you did have nice interpolative effects . ; That is , that yes , if you knew what the reverberation condition was gonna be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . ; But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two .
Bro021_419	b	Yeah . ; So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients , ; not thirteen ? ; Yeah .
Bns001_1787	s	That 's a starting . ; That 's a ramp . ; And we can go in different directions . ; And if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or UMTS or whatever , great .
Bmr025_30	s	just so I can get the data formats ; and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? ; Certainly . ; Yeah I mean , it 's in the same place it 's been .
Bro007_73	%--	Um ; Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers . ; Yeah . ; Uh actually the way things seems to
Btr001_1276	aa	if ; Mm - hmm . ; so . ; No .
Bed015_291	s	I 'm sorry , ; Yeah . ; you 're right . ; A construction type .
Bmr031_98	t1	but , uh , before he left we gave him , uh , another set of meetings to give to the transcribers . ; And ; How many ? ; Uh , what is it ?
Bns002_1030	s	And then , uh I 'm using soft routing . ; I 'm I 'm including on the on the uh header of this packet , the set of eh nodes that should be forwarding this node to the destination . ; eh of course , uh these uh two approaches can be can be uh somehow mixed ; and some hybrid proposals are also on the on the paper ,
Bro026_372	s	Uh , they have some cepstral modification , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; In our case we have a couple things .
Bro012_588	aa	and ; But we 've not discussed it it it this yet , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_252	g	I don't really know . ; Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever . ; Ooo , it 's just big . ; But I mean , this 'll get us a bit closer at least , right ?
Bro028_534	ba	I mean ; Yeah . ; So m I guess maybe they 're error rates ; but they 're , uh they 're really high .
Bed005_1272	aa	If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one . ; OK . ; So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ? ; Absolutely .
Bed009_887	bk	But did you have that ? ; So it 's ; Yeah th the information is available . ; OK .
Btr002_1658	%	I ; I love those . ; Yeah . ; I like those
Bmr019_568	s	But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ? ; Yeah . When you listen to it , uh , the PZM and the PDA Yeah , th the PDA has higher sound floor ; u Yeah . ; but not by a lot .
Bmr016_1782	b	Right . ; Right . ; Yeah you never would put " tickle " in the language model in that form , ; Right .
Bro003_191	s	yeah , yeah . ; Tell him about the cube . ; Well . The cube ? ; I should tell him about the cube ?
Bmr025_380	b	Uh that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , ; Sorry . ; I think , I mean eh where ; yeah .
Bmr024_308	ba	So they can they can , um , scroll through that pretty quick ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's great .
Bro022_1009	%--	That 's it for me . ; OK . ; So , uh ; u
Bmr008_744	s	Most of but most of those people don't rely on the self - evaluations , anyway . ; Well that 's what I was gonna ask , ; is that ; They 'll probably listen to the speech ,
Bmr026_907	s	I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .
Bro027_1373	b	In the , um a lot of the , um the Hub - five systems , um , recently have been using LDA . ; and and they , um They run LDA on the features right before they train the models . ; So there 's the the LDA is is right there before the H M ; Yeah .
Bro022_1101	%--	That 's something I observe using that filter . ; And ; Yeah . ; There are a few
Bmr010_280	s	It wouldn't be a problem . ; And I 've got some some kind of manual down in my office . ; Well , maybe we should get it ; and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available .
Bns001_682	aa	Yeah , what is what means quality of service . ; A certain degree . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bed009_915	s	i ; Oh , OK . ; it 's Morphix is not used on - line . ; s so the lexicon might be derived by Morphix
Bro027_247	s	Oh , ; So , I got in touch with Joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . ; OK . ; And , uh , they added me to the list
Btr002_2734	s	Great . ; when there 's really long spaces , it segments random spaces in between . ; And th you know , they get that ; and there 's nothing there ,
Btr002_2382	b	because it was always in a g the one I 'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something . ; Yes . Uh - huh . ; And so it wasn't ever like a , um , single l ; Mmm .
Bmr019_1008	s	Well , ; I think ; That 's interesting . ; No . I think it 's actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations .
Bmr008_1143	s	Um , just as an example , it would be , " Source , Adam Janin " , " Destination , Morgan " , " Relationship , Advisor " . ; Oh , so you 're just putting preexisting relationships that are ; that are relevant . ; I think that starts to There 's definitely some clear cases ,
Bro027_903	b	I wanted to do something very similar to the proposal as a first first try . ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bro024_626	bs	Which means decrease in word error rate ? ; Yeah . ; OK , ; so " percentage increase " means decrease ?
Bmr028_418	bk	Cuz if you 're only at part of a meeting , or something ; So , we have our first information retrieval example . ; It 's a regular expression ; Yeah . That 's right .
Bmr003_250	b	I mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus ; and I think it 's gonna be generally useful . ; I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before . ; Oh .
Bed006_1668	s	yeah . ; Always thinking about binding . ; Well the the the binding is technically no problem ; but it 's it for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s if if there if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature ,
Bro013_638	b	and and our first kilohertz , even . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1387	b	Everybody thought it would do everything . ; Um , and a really common error that people were making was , they were just reporting their , uh uh , classification results on the data that they were training on . ; And so I think it was it was it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say " hey , I know I 'm doing something that isn't kosher " . ; Hmm .
Btr002_619	s	Mm - hmm . ; Good . I I that was my impression also . ; That 's that 's what I th ; It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones .
Bmr013_634	b	And um , so . ; So , current This week . ; so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , ; Yes .
Bro003_990	s	we have MSG , ; we have JRA ; you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen , ; won't take uh a huge amount of development ,
Btr001_787	%--	" Shh " . ; It 's a sound that ; It 's like the noisy , uh , um , like airflow ones where you 've got like a a stoppage in your mouth ; like , uh , like your tongue
Bmr027_238	b	so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm not telling you what to decide . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_561	aa	I mean it 's it 's not even a h ; Yeah . ; OK , so it 's a little thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_498	%--	Tag by uh ; And the tags we looked at are the spurt tag , ; which basically says ; or actually
Bmr016_342	bk	v W we 're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on ; and I 'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number , that 's read speech ; and I thought " well , we 're gonna do better on that , ; Oh I see .
Btr002_1404	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Oh yes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_738	%--	Do you kno recall if the insertions were were higher with MSG ? ; I don't know . ; I cannot tell . ; But
Bro027_24	ba	Yeah . ; So . ; Um . ; Yeah , it 's it 's interesting .
Bro003_206	s	And then to have systems with neural networks trained on , uh , data from the same language , if possible , with , well , using a more generic database , which is phonetically phonetically balanced , ; and . Um . ; Yeah . So . ; So - so we had talked I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ?
Bed015_548	b	Hmm . ; In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Btr001_2160	aa	Uh - huh . ; I mean , does everyone agree with that intu ; I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed017_573	b	Yeah . ; The idea was there . Yeah , OK . ; uh to to exploit FrameNet there as well . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1934	%--	right ? ; Yeah yeah , that 's no problem . ; I also find that some of the ; you know , if someone sits there and and
Bmr019_94	s	Um , and in retrospect that 's not as surprising as maybe i ; it shouldn't have been as surprising as I as as I felt it was . ; The lapel mike is a very high - quality microphone . ; And as Morgan pointed out , that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking .
Bmr027_271	bk	S so maybe when ; Am I on , by the way ? ; I don't know . ; Oh .
Bsr001_2560	s	I at least very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer . ; No ? ; It ; For ours it will
Bmr031_1112	s	what type of utterance , ; whether it 's a question or a statement or whatever . ; And then you have an , uh you know , an a tag attribute ; and the value of that encodes the choice .
Bmr002_1303	aa	islands of certainty . ; Is that it ? ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1496	s	It was at the beginning . ; Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things . ; But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap ; but it it 's marked pretty clearly .
Bro018_207	s	What are what are your f uh frame error rates for for this ? ; Eh fifty - f six ; uh no , the frame error rate ? ; Fifty - six I think .
Bmr013_226	s	It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? ; Mitch showed that , and some , dissertations have shown that . ; Right . ; So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference .
Bmr006_1105	s	the the mix , mixed speech . ; " Mixed " . Thank you . ; Eh , why ? ; Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA .
Bed015_1168	s	like a container or sort of support - ish . ; And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic ; like " source , path , goal " is often thought of that way ; or " force " , or something like that .
Bmr005_892	cc	Just output . ; Although if you if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter ; Oh ! I have to remember . ; I 'll think about it ,
Bmr005_931	s	Yeah . ; and that seems to be a lot of overlap . ; Yeah . ; I think it 's an empirical question .
Bmr015_127	bc	to match . ; Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ? ; Yeah . ; Four thousand .
Bmr015_1021	s	and breaths are part of real speech . ; Well , except that these are really truly ; I mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did ; n the first one that I did for i for this ,
Bmr003_2139	ba	Yeah . ; Ah ! ; So . ; That 's really cruel .
Bmr031_836	s	Yeah . ; Last updated in July . ; That one that you have ? ; Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back .
Bmr024_1219	ar	I mean , we don ; No , actually there 's more training data . ; This is on just digits ? ; No , no .
Bro028_903	s	uh , because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz . ; And and the , uh , transcribers will have fun with that . ; Uh And , um , ; the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much .
Bro005_992	b	and you have um some reasonable database , ; um ; but then which is um copied over many times with a range of different noises , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1479	s	Well y ; Yeah . ; Exactly . ; I mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the Hub - five system ,
Bmr020_1855	s	Good . ; Worry about it when we get back . ; Let ; And see how well they do .
Bmr014_178	bk	If ; So we 're not increasing the number of channels . ; No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working , ; OK .
Bmr016_367	ba	Yeah . ; Right , and so I still like the idea of having some kind of digit data . ; OK . ; Good .
Bmr018_1238	s	Then it then it falls back this way so it 's ; Well wh what it 's supposed to do is the backstrap is supposed to be under your crown , ; and so that should be should be ; if it 's right against your head there , which is what it 's supposed to be , that balances it
Bmr018_186	co	Um ; Hand - checked ? ; Cuz that was one of the processes we were talking about as well . ; Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it ,
Bro026_115	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; Cool . ; Yeah .
Bed008_215	%--	and so forth ; Yeah . ; uh ; so we 're
Bed005_970	bk	But , I I It 's not only uh Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together . ; So I 'll dig up some more stuff from Dekai . ; And so why don't we just do the , uh ; OK .
Bmr018_753	b	Right , which should be pretty straight forward . ; Which a at least is well defined , ; and ; Yeah .
Bro019_1330	no	It ; Huh ? ; Cumulants or something . ; Uh , I don't know .
Bmr014_654	s	And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . ; And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . ; Yeah . ; And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,
Bro023_1123	2	But . ; So , basically it 's similar . ; I mean , what you did , it 's similar ; It 's similar in the smoothing
Bmr016_2271	aa	you 'd have to constantly re rerun that , ; I know . ; so , maybe ; Right .
Bro014_306	s	and here 's its score . ; And then you can look at ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do .
Bed005_682	s	No . ; I think I think the i the idea is that ; OK . ; Oh . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal ,
Bro022_776	b	Do we ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? ; No . ; Because we don't didn't looked that much at that . ; Yeah .
Bed004_744	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that is um , ; and , uh , I had one more thing , ; the it needs to do
Bro012_1427	%--	Another person 's voice . ; what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding ; It also ; one oh
Bed004_725	s	" Agent " , yeah , " Agent " , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah , ; that uh is rule - driven , and can can uh can do things like that . ; And um there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision , ; so it probably will .
Bmr014_605	s	yeah . ; OK . ; So . ; But basically that 's one of the main changes .
Bro011_594	b	but the actual words for some of them are half as long ; you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . ; Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , uh you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1099	s	you can't work on everything . ; Yeah . ; Uh . Uh . Yeah . ; Yeah , so we should find out if it 's really better .
Bro022_340	bk	OK . ; Yeah , ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1045	s	Right ? ; That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . ; For example , they could be " time of day " , ; in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning , afternoon , evening , night " .
Bro013_655	s	so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we uh you know , uh model the time series that that happens ; um and and we talked a little bit about factorial H M Ms and how um when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for for these H M ; and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't um don't over - alert the problem ; there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on uh the sub - problems at hand
Bro007_464	b	For the clean TI - digits but we did not test it yet . ; Uh the clean training stuff . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bed002_143	s	and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , ; as well as the close talking mikes . ; What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , ; gives us , um , high quality audio ,
Bmr023_1177	b	Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . ; Um , however , there 's times when it is not good . ; Uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1206	aa	As you should never do worse . ; I I , uh , missed what you said . ; Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_1023	b	But something like ; and I couldn't get anything . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_921	bk	i it it may be that that you 're finding something good ; and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_741	b	and then send send the same thing out , or maybe split it in halves or something something like that to a to an outside service ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is . ; Right .
Bro021_479	b	um , somehow putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that I have about voicing . ; So , um , in particular I was thinking , um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those LNA files , and , um , setting to zero those probabilities that , um that these phones are not voicing . ; So say , like , I know this particular segment is voicing , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_753	s	In the far - field mike . ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Um , and uh , it 's not obvious ,
Bro024_987	s	because it 's completely causal . ; Oh . ; So ; So I got actually just the results for the Italian for that
Bro019_1309	b	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1484	bk	and the idea w the thought was , " Well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , ; but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the LDA in place of the neural net , ; so that we can you know , show a clear path . ; Right .
Bro008_88	s	How much how much better was the best system than ours ? ; Well , we don't know yet . ; Mmm . ; Uh , I mean , first place , there 's still this thing to to work out ,
Bro017_346	s	To some extent , it that is also true . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But it 's but for but for instance , th uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it .
Bro003_95	cc	so . ; Will that be enough time ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front .
Bro003_1640	s	So . ; Um ; So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things , ; but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet .
Bmr010_455	s	Just , uh ; So , yeah . Maybe I 'll , uh , ping them a little bit about it to get that straight . ; OK . ; I 'm keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible .
Btr002_66	s	Wow ! ; I I ; It 's really enormously far away . ; Now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad .
Bmr028_1440	s	Did you break the microphone ? ; Yeah . ; Just the clip . ; Nnn . OK .
Bro019_128	s	For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , ; and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . ; So . ; You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent ,
Bro027_1185	%--	Mm - hmm . ; but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch . ; So , ; I mean , this may be
Bed016_1146	b	Oh , you want a lexical example . ; But I don't need it . ; Well , you might want both . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_628	s	So " hypotenuse " , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And the second use , um , is in FrameNet. It 's
Bed006_789	s	um ; cuz we 've been arguing about it all week , ; but uh we 'll hold the the ; Well in this case it will hold the I mean the the features I guess .
Bed003_598	co	That that doesn't uh ; it 's not really consistent . ; They don't discuss the admission fee . ; Make that false .
Bro023_935	s	No , ; after . ; Right . ; So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often you would end up with , uh with negative values .
Bmr026_1135	s	sorry , ; it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . ; Right . ; So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference
Bmr020_1432	b	We can do that . ; There are lots of ways to do it . ; I have one program that 'll do it . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_690	b	Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . ; Right , that 's true . ; Yeah , so it 's , uh , people people getting shy about it . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_900	s	So we we had , uh ; Hmm . ; ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data ; and and and nobody happened to mention it to us ,
Bmr031_988	bk	No one early next week . ; Yeah . Let me check with Robert again , ; but I I 'm pretty sure that there 's nothing this week . ; OK .
Bmr013_785	cc	OK , so if I , ; OK , included include , ; OK , then , uh , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour ; and I could get the transcribers to do that
Buw001_1276	bd	Yeah . That 's why I was wondering . ; So ; Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done ; I mean , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries .
Bmr031_287	b	Most certainly . So it 's just , uh , if we 're gonna do that we should give some thought to how we wanna divide it up . ; Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , maybe someone else would do a lot of the work where probably your advice ; Yeah . And similarly with digits . We now have a lot of digits ; Yeah .
Bro007_67	s	so it 's uh basically s the same except that we don't have this uh low - pass filtering so we have only two streams . ; Step . ; Well . ; There 's there 's no low low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .
Bmr030_393	s	which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes . ; So either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes , ; Oh . ; so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them .
Bro024_940	bk	or ? ; Yeah ; then after that it is s almost the same as the baseline prop system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1360	bk	Oh . ; Ni ; That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower . ; Ahh .
Bro023_809	%	Uh , how about the subspace stuff ? ; Subspace , I 'm I 'm like that 's still in a little bit in the back burner ; because I 've been p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff . ; OK .
Bro007_37	b	Yeah . ; The second path is uh MLP also using nine frames several frames of features ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_275	ar	And are those mutually exclusive sets ? ; Not at all . ; That 's that that needs a lot of work . ; No .
Bro023_635	%--	And and then you What you do is you , uh b ; fff . ; So again , ; I can write down some of these eq
Bed015_1724	aa	Yeah , I mean ; It 's like I don't totally think ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed003_1552	s	That feed into those ? ; Nah ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world .
Bed002_613	qh	And if to actually do that , build it , um you know , run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . ; And see how that goes . ; If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . ; So where would you get this information ?
Bro004_734	b	If we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundaries somewhere in the space . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_982	%--	OK . ; Just they didn't get marked . ; OK . So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something ; I w I
Bed004_615	bk	Right . ; Right . ; Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case . ; OK .
Bmr015_1225	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So ; I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation .
Bmr031_292	s	but most of them aren't transcribed . ; So if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them , we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus . ; Yeah . Well , we 'd ; And so , same issue .
Bro024_741	b	I mean yeah , uh , I discovered the same problem when I started working on uh , on this Aurora task almost two years ago , ; that you have the problem with this mulit ; a at the beginning we had only this multi condition training of the TI - digits . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1018	s	y Right ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; And then um then see , again , how ; We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh a a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than than , uh we 're gonna test on ,
Buw001_2070	s	and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in ; cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this ; and said that those are nothing like these meetings . ; Um , so there 're really two different kinds of data .
Buw001_264	s	Yeah . ; W ; And and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking , ; the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later .
Bmr015_780	%--	To get the pitch , yes . ; But the harmonic , no . ; But i ; But the harmonics are gonna be ,
Bmr031_471	s	They 're taking up more disk space . ; Yeah . It ; Yeah . ; I I I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion with them .
Bmr014_426	s	but ; So there are numbers , then there are acronyms , ; and then um , there 's a he she wants the uh , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , ; so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either " VOC " for vocalized ,
Bmr018_375	aa	and they have multiple , ; uh , well , let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet . ; So but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically , ; Right .
Btr001_2234	bk	Or y ; I 've heard you say " so " , in that sort of sense ; like uh , um , " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_604	s	Oh , they ; OK . ; Oh whoops . ; That didn't work .
Bed016_283	s	Oh , OK . ; the you can observe that all the time , ; Oh really . ; they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine .
Buw001_758	b	So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say " I won't participate " . ; Mmm . ; That 's true . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_908	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . ; And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . ; And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing
Bed004_524	s	F full stop , ; I mean , that 's what you do . ; Ev - every landmark you take a picture of , ; Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .
Bed009_363	s	uh Michael is doing that , ; right ? ; Well uh Marcus Lerkult is actually implementing that stuff ; and Marcus and Michael together are um leading the discussion there ,
Bed009_391	bk	Yes . ; So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now , ; per tells the person how to go , ; OK .
Bro003_1938	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; this is another p
Bed015_318	aa	Right , right . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And I think that 's just fine . ; Which is fine , yeah .
Bmr020_682	s	Yeah . ; So I I 'm actually about to send Brian Kingbury an email saying where he can find the the s the m the material he wanted for the s for the speech recognition experiment , ; so ; but I haven't sent it out yet
Bmr026_597	s	Oh , ; So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .
Bmr013_170	b	OK . ; s @ @ . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , ; Alright . ; Hmm .
Bmr020_747	s	Don't don't don't say . ; Dash . ; Anyway . ; So all I all I was gonna do there was stick the the transcripts after we the way that we munged them for scoring ,
Bmr003_312	s	I don't know . ; Something like that . ; Um , for some more money to do more data . ; So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings .
Bed008_74	s	Hmm . ; So so ; the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when ; so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all ,
Bro026_122	s	right ? ; And so ; Mmm , since the meeting , ; That was that was Tuesday .
Bmr014_163	s	Right . ; And we have five , we 're getting one more . ; Yeah . ; And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station ,
Bed015_2060	s	I was just checking like , when we wanna , um , get the posterior probability of , like , variables . ; With the ; You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? ; You can't .
Bns002_109	bk	So there 's a certain kind of task uh , for one node within the ad - hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world , ; right ? ; That 's O K . ; OK .
Bmr020_121	b	it 's ; Huh ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_131	ba	It 's gonna be fun to see how we , compare at this . ; Yeah . ; How did we do on the TI - digits ? ; Very exciting . s @ @ .
Bed010_49	s	And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . ; And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . ; So , you have a basically , a goal ; and it , you know , says " OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,
Bro017_1057	s	Idle time . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Nobody was looking even at what was coming out .
Bmr008_1641	g	Mmm . ; I 'm wondering about um if there ; I suppose this is still just that one that one data sample , ; right ,
Bmr007_344	s	This is really interesting data . ; Yeah , it is . ; I think so too , I think ; I think what 's really interesting though , it is before d saying " yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps " is to actually find out how many more we have than two - party .
Bro004_257	%--	there is a reduction in performance , when you don't um have the s when you don't have um ; Task data . ; Wait a minute , ; th th the
Bmr019_1680	s	Yeah . ; But ; Tha - There are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh , these ca Not a lot , but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker ; and you can tell that when you run it .
Bmr019_129	aa	but they 're not noise - cancelling . ; So , uh ; They 're they 're intended to be omni - directional . ; Right .
Btr002_553	s	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Like if that part is damaged . ; So , but , um ; Selective .
Bmr027_995	s	th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings ; and they can grab those , too , with SCP . ; Wait . So you put the reference files ? ; No , no . They d they wanted the audio .
Bsr001_1089	s	We 're talking about that right now . ; Can y ; I 'm not sure how much I should say about it . ; Yeah , that 's what I was wondering .
Bmr010_1579	aa	Uh , we can prove that the ; Whether it 'll work or not . ; this kind o emph emphasises parameter and Gaussian ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1776	b	And I picked up with an ellipsis . ; Right . ; Excellent . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1515	b	Sure . ; That 's the that was the intent of of it , basically . ; Uh that 's true . ; Sure .
Bns003_798	s	so that 's ; So I will stay here till the end of February ; and ; afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm yeah , funded by an institution of the German government ,
Bmr027_240	s	So I 'm not telling you what to decide . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'm just saying you should decide something , ; I already did decide something ,
Bsr001_2180	b	I don't think we have any problem . ; I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC . ; No , ; yeah .
Bmr027_1134	s	cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh ; Did I say that ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because the it 's not what I said " .
Bro023_15	s	Uh , we 'll see . ; We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something . ; Huh . ; So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing
Bro016_271	%--	But , ; once we knew what rou roughly the right operating range was , it was pretty stable , ; and Uh , we might just not even be in the right operating range . ; So , would the ?
Bed002_355	s	but just is something we can set . ; And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out . ; We want to have an a structure resulting ; if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode .
Bro022_341	bk	Yeah , ; I see . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr011_1436	s	I think , you know , all these things are ; Oh , yeah . ; I think there 's ; we should go beyond , uh , ICSI
Bmr019_319	qrr	Uh - huh . ; The other thing is , isn't TI - digits isolated digits ? ; Right . ; Or is that another one ?
Btr001_1255	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; " Laugh , period " . ; Yeah .
Bed005_603	g	Uh , take what they have , ; send it to everybody saying " this is what they have , ; this is what we think we should add " , ; OK ?
Bmr026_838	%--	We We ; So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh .
Bed015_946	b	But it 's still is limited possibility . ; Hmm . ; So that should , you know , interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there . ; Yeah .
Bro016_1089	ba	Um . So it 's , um it 's a little different , ; in at least in my mind . ; I mean , when we did the SPAM work I mean , there we had we had this notion of an , uh , auditory @ @ auditory event . ; Good . That 's great .
Bed011_1058	%--	so ; yeah . ; Right . ; So the idea is going to be to do
Bmr027_59	s	At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ? ; No . ; We had spoken w about this before ; and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once .
Bro012_1467	b	Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis . ; They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr006_1011	b	So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . ; Yeah , because ; Yeah yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_250	%--	but but , um , ; couldn't you , uh , if you if you sort of did a first pass ; I don't know what kind of , uh , uh , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , uh , uh , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something . ; But if you did first pass with , um , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one ,
Bed008_971	b	Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we we , in no , in ; Mmm . ; Well , but the good thing is we we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love . ; Right .
Bmr006_951	b	Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . ; Yeah . ; It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1778	s	uh , ; or , you know , a so - so job . ; You can you can you can throw in a couple fea ; we know what what kinds of features help with it .
Bmr007_1002	%--	Yep . ; Everyone else . ; Yeah . ; um If you model the the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else 's microphone , as well as on that , and you build , um
Bed014_362	s	Um , ; and it would take a really long time to explain it now , ; but I 'm about to write it up this evening . ; I solved that at the same time as " how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase " to get something like " I the kicked dog " .
Bro012_577	s	Well . For the moment they 're ; uh everybody 's quite ; um ; There is this Eurospeech deadline ,
Bed004_894	%--	Looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem , ; for example , is , you know , she actually m said you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff . ; Nuh ? ; So this is definitely interesting , and
Bmr009_435	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh and I I would still guess that if they are not separated at all , that there 's some there 's there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1231	s	So I don't know if the I mean i if th just there 's more s here that 's not shown that you it 's already like part of the system whatever , ; but , " where is X " , like , the fact that it is , you know , a speech - act , whatever , ; it is a question . ; It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X ,
Bmr008_520	aa	yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them ; then you 'd put the regions . ; For the others , you would just leave it . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1181	s	but it 's not yet finished . ; It 's work in progress . ; OK . Any sense about how how it does on ? ; Yeah . For , uh for for the paper I w I want to submit to ASRU to to , uh , evaluate the quality of the speech - nonspeech detection by using it for speech recognition .
Bmr009_580	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1502	b	I usually just don't use that , I think . ; Yeah , that skips ; Oh , is that what you 're talking about ? ; Oh .
Bmr023_336	ba	and and and and Um , ; so it makes sense . ; Uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . ; We 're really lucky the two that we kept .
Bro024_1867	bk	It 's with the noisy one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh !
Bmr016_1995	b	Oh , so you could do " grep minus V nums " . ; So that 's the ; and you get rid of anything that was read . ; yeah .
Bro019_365	s	Slightly . ; But , not very significantly . ; And uh , that was ; uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA .
Bmr001_410	s	So , six gigabytes . ; But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels . ; Forty - eight kilohertz , yeah . ; So we can actually triple that .
Bro004_512	s	uh but with increased frame numbers . ; Mmm . ; And we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we don't use ; delta but it 's not not that much .
Bro003_1364	s	because the the program with the label obtained that I have , the Albayzin , is different w to the label to train the neural network . ; And that is another work that we must to do , to to change . ; I I didn't understand . ; Uh , for example Albayzin database was labeled automatically with HTK .
Bmr016_907	%	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_53	s	Mm - hmm . ; so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . ; Basically , it just means " build the tree . " ; And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .
Bmr011_344	s	You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things ; That would be cool . ; Yeah , that would be neat . ; or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want
Bmr007_929	s	But , eh do do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply the the , eh the BIC criterion to detect the the the different acoustic change , eh between speaker , ; without , uh with , uh silence or with overlapping , ; uh , ; I think like like , eh eh a general , eh eh way of process the the acoustic change .
Bro005_283	fa	Oh , I 'm sorry , ; I k I keep getting confused ; because this is accuracy . ; Yeah , sorry .
Bro017_1096	s	And the pub owner says " oh my four o ' clock , OK , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying . " ; There was no plane for some reason , ; And there wasn't ? ; it was downed ,
Bro014_1390	bk	Yeah . ; So probably we 'll have to use , like , long f long frames . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_355	b	And , uh , ; Also we were thinking to to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed012_489	cc	Mm - hmm . ; well the the intent , here , was Where - Is " , ; OK , right . ; and I could look at those .
Buw001_1388	s	Yeah . ; I I I mean , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system ; Right . ; so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later ,
Bmr024_1096	bk	It 's all tape robot , ; So it 's just ; so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command . ; Oh , OK .
Bro014_1446	%--	OK . ; Uh , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source , ; Uh , ; or ?
Bro016_847	s	Um . ; Anyway , eh ; Yeah . ; Cuz if if the log probs that are coming out of the MSG are really big , the standard insertion penalty is gonna have very little effect
Bmr022_1428	b	cuz I didn't think I had permission , when I did . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and then just seeing if that is enough to to handle the transcript changes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_1118	b	Mm - hmm . ; And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro010_557	s	So you have a mixture of two Gaussians . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know .
Bmr029_875	b	Righ - ? ; because when I heard how little speech there was for some of them , I thought they can only hurt your models , ; because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map , ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1192	b	Huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it , ; Yeah .
Bro023_74	bk	is that what you mean ? ; Twelve seconds , um , counting back from the end of the current frame , ; yeah . ; OK ,
Bns002_927	s	Now processors are much more uh power efficient than before . ; OK ? ; Yeah , but anyway , that was the reason for my question . ; If I save with a lot of difficult mechanism , within the air interface and between the base station or access point and the mobile node , one percent of the power whereas ninety - nine percent is consumed by packet processing
Bmr016_1983	b	So there will be a " NUMS " tag on those lines ? ; There is . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1038	s	But I don't think it 's " aha ! " . ; Yeah . ; It 's more like " uh - huh ! " ; rather than " uh - huh " .
Bed014_1355	b	Yes . ; Yeah . We actually have I think we have been making progress , ; and its sort of surprising . ; Yeah .
Buw001_493	%--	I 'd have to get started someplace . ; So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , ; I remember that , ; um , what was the part that "
Bmr008_532	b	My Fair Lady 's ; Are you s Do they have a bunch of options like uh ; Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_273	ba	Versus if they heard a slightly different one . ; Yeah . ; Hmm , interesting . ; Yeah , that 's a good , like , error checking approach , I think .
Bed013_487	s	Yeah . Yeah . ; Even neuro . ; And ; uh , both learning and like , comprehension , production , that kinda stuff .
Btr002_2739	%--	So usually I take those out . ; That 's right . ; Yeah . ; Well they give the segmenter , though
Bmr005_86	s	but also the the the causal aspects of the uh floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall ; and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it ; and it These sorts of things . ; So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type
Btr002_1922	%	Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think . ; No . ; Good . ; Sure .
Bro014_991	aa	It 's not part of a VAD system that you 're doing ? ; Th ; No . ; Uh , no .
Bmr024_1325	g	Um . ; Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set , ; It d if you if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that , ; can't you ?
Btr001_2334	aa	uh " . ; I mean ; Do you Have you run across this ? ; Yeah .
Bmr023_400	s	And and and she was ; And so , I asked her ; I mean , They 're very perceptive . ; I really want to have this meeting of the transcribers .
Bsr001_437	b	And ; So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1840	bk	Right , exactly . ; and and until they 've been listened to they stay as " ICSI " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed015_546	s	We 're not saying What 's hypothetical about this world . ; In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . ; Hmm . ; In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away
Bro028_147	bk	and the silence probabilities also . ; Right . ; And things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the tandem network , we use the silence probability , uh , given by the VAD network , ; Oh .
Bed003_1776	s	simple linguistic stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hardly anything complicated . ; No metaphors whatsoever .
Bmr020_557	s	Yeah . ; But he yeah , he 's he 's right , ; y I mean maybe ; you weren't intending to pause at all ,
Bmr009_872	bk	I rest my ; And then the others are later on . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bed015_1471	s	Yeah . ; Um , hearer is a little bit harder . ; It could be like multiple people . ; I guess that that that that 's not very clear from here
Bro024_999	%--	So it 's just like it 's like a three percent relative degradation , ; with the ; But but is there is there a problem with the one hundred eighty milliseconds ? ; Or ?
Bed002_183	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; And uh , just give me a call , ; which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .
Bed010_1097	s	OK . ; Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people , ; right ? ; So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .
Buw001_1549	s	Yeah . ; Dates maybe . ; I don't know . ; That 's something I always forget .
Bns002_66	bk	and we go around here , every member . ; OK . ; So . ; OK .
Bro004_932	s	Yeah . ; mm - hmm ; It 's one net with um twenty - seven outputs ; if we have twenty - seven classes ,
Bmr002_1334	aa	Yeah , people do different different ways , ; OK . ; a and so just as long as it 's systematic in my view , you can always filter it into some other format . ; Yeah , exactly .
Bed009_56	s	and almost tested ; and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on ; and that should be no problem ; and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain .
Bmr030_289	bk	because the best the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots . ; Right , well , then it 's not a linear f fit . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bed009_1104	s	Yeah , OK . ; Part of it comes from the user model . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,
Btr002_563	d	Hmm . ; apparently . ; Hmm . ; Is better ?
Bmr003_1512	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that . ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bro023_418	%--	an and what are we talking about here ? ; Is this TI - digits ; It 's the It - it 's Italian . ; or
Btr002_135	aa	Now this this is interesting ; because it 's like , you know , we know that there 's no Annette on any of the meetings we 've ever dealt with , ; Right . ; Right .
Bed011_87	b	you didn't . ; OK . We were gonna put this in front of people . ; They give us some information on themselves . ; OK .
Bns001_960	no	but ; I have a an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS . ; I mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing ; and uh I 'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation .
Bro003_1014	bk	Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension . ; Here . ; Just ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr025_697	%--	i ; Um . ; But ; My opinion on it is ,
Bed005_1274	s	So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ? ; Absolutely . ; OK . ; Uh , or , link to
Bro004_394	%--	Hmm . ; But I I I I think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's
Bed015_1914	s	Mmm . ; And we 'll see what we need for those two . ; And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion ; but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've we really want to get done .
Bed015_1288	s	Mm - hmm . ; So this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this ignoring li ; OK . ; I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it .
Bmr005_879	s	Uh . No . No . ; It was when I was working for the government . ; Oh , then everybody owns it . ; It 's the people .
Bed015_1489	s	Mm - hmm . ; In which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . ; But when you actually say that " he walked into " , whatever , um , the " he " will refer to a particular ; You you will already have figured who " he " or " you " , mmm , or " I " , maybe is a bett better example , who " I " refers to .
Bmr012_454	%--	Yeah . ; I mean ; Right . ; and I guess Ramana ,
Bmr022_17	bk	so I have to ; Oops . ; Barbara told me . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1096	s	Hmm . ; Sorry . ; but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that ; and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion .
Bro027_1743	no	maybe , yeah , when ; But in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in ? ; And let the net do that ? ; Well , u Not sure .
Bmr002_836	2	This is true . ; This is true . ; Which of course is another issue . ; Or maybe not .
Bed013_666	s	don't make any plans for spring break next year . ; That 's ; Oh , shoot . ; That 's the other thing .
Btr002_2858	%--	Right . ; But even in cases like that , even when it is ; see now I 'm contradicting myself , ; but even when it is very turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people ,
Bed002_72	qy	Um , yeah . ; or ? ; No . There was there was Let 's see . ; Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?
Bmr020_831	bk	OK . ; Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version , ; yeah . OK . ; Yeah ,
Bro011_179	s	Well maybe we should just ; uh I mean you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before ; right ? ; And this machines are busy
Bed015_1725	%--	It 's like I don't totally think ; Yeah . ; Right . ; I mostly think , uh
Bro003_1609	%--	Um . ; Yeah , ; and we do have ; I mean ,
Buw001_1974	s	um , so , ; um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened . ; But I wonder if Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? ; So either by rules of participation , or whatever .
Bmr018_771	s	Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries . ; Oh , MNCM . ; Mm - hmm . ; We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries ,
Bmr002_770	s	Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things . ; What they 're doing is trying to bring together ; and they rate things . ; I wasn't focused on that
Bed011_514	s	But this is open . ; So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy . ; And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense . ; And um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer .
Bmr003_1904	bk	and Dan has a few , ; Yes . ; Ah ! ; Right ,
Bns002_1161	fa	all of use are now aware of the availability of this eh standard the I - triple - E eight hundred and two point eleven ; uh in fact it is it is powering you know , uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area . ; And in the beginning , the first adaptors uh ; Oops !
Btr002_464	b	Yeah . ; Good . ; But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel ; Yes .
Bed005_431	s	So , this ; e I 'm not sure e that ; Um well , we we 'll see , when we say , ; let 's test something ,
Bsr001_2478	s	Greasy wash water , ; I know the numbers that were used ; oh . ; In one ear .
Bmr028_1153	aa	Probably garbage . ; Whatever the language model says . ; I bet the pruning ; Yep .
Bed002_1138	aa	you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . ; So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like . ; Doesn't does SmartKom system have such packages ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_636	s	Because you know I Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . ; So if it could be before that would be be ; No , no but I I I don't need other folks for the meeting . ; I can do it .
Btr001_709	s	Yeah right . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Um , so you have to just move it back a little bit .
Bmr009_1226	qw	Hmm ? ; And and had he had a pretty noticeable drawl . ; OK , so . I propose , take out Northern add , don't know . ; Oh . Yeah . I I would say more more sweepingly , " how would you characterize your accent ? "
Bmr022_1487	%	I wasn't planning on doing it simultaneously . ; Alright . ; Lee , you liked that l ; huh ?
Bed002_1183	bk	Yeah bu w I 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , uh , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package ; No . ; and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something . ; Sure .
Bed014_996	bk	But , um . I mean , there are also usually then holidays anyways . ; I mean like Sometimes it works out that way . ; Usually ? ; So . Hmm !
Btr002_1551	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Now I know what you 're talking about .
Bro004_186	bk	And we lose ; So they were sort of building here ? ; Yeah . ; OK ?
Buw001_749	s	Alex Waibel 's group . ; And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time ; Mm - hmm . ; and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room .
Bro015_54	b	So they would just provide that as part of the data . ; Maybe . ; But this is still ; Yeah .
Bed004_456	s	OK ? ; and maybe a binary version f for each , or some relatively compact decision node just above the final one . ; Mmm . ; And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about , uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting from the various inputs to the things you care about .
Bmr030_526	aa	Right . ; You 're just talking about playing it and recording it , like , real - time ? ; bad . ; Yep .
Bsr001_388	t3	yeah . ; I mean , it 's my impression . I mean , of course there is a lot more work to do with this one ; It 's really good . ; Oh , how fun !
Bns001_1802	qy	OK , ; yeah , that 's right . ; So maybe I will find him @ @ . ; Oh , can you call Adam ?
Bmr011_1696	s	Yeah . Anyway . ; Padded cell . ; It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the ; There was a dorm room at Tech that , uh , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , uh , the floor with mattresses .
Bro017_638	s	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; So . ; Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor ,
Bro012_221	aa	and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate . ; A tenth of a per cent . ; Even tenth of a percent ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_96	s	Uh the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . ; You know . We had a list of things like " to go " and " to visit " and what not . ; The " landmark - iness " of uh ; I knew you 'd like that .
Bed008_428	b	Uh Uh well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky . ; Uh from the belief - net point of view it is ; from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1529	b	Yeah . ; At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , uh , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has has some noisy noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed010_1092	s	and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co ; these guys are talking , ; uh we have a group on the formalization , ; uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers .
Bed003_1508	b	Mm - hmm . ; It was actually OK . ; You know , on Boston New York , ; Yeah .
Bro003_14	t3	Uh So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do do our digits . ; Uh transcript one three one one dash one three three zero . three two three four seven six five five three one six two four one six seven seven eight nine zero nine four zero zero three zero one five eight one seven three five three two six eight zero three six two four three zero seven four five zero six nine four seven four eight five seven nine six one five O seven eight O two zero nine six zero four zero zero one two Uh Yeah , you don't actually n need to say the name . ; OK , this is Barry Chen and I am reading transcript ; That 'll probably be bleeped out .
Bmr019_807	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there . ; And so the reject is also mapping and pauses
Bmr029_887	bk	Oh , no . Sorry . ; Not in the short . ; Then you have too little data . ; OK .
Bmr002_799	s	That 's the Text Encoding Initiative . ; Oh . ; That 's a way of marking mark - up . ; so , you know , but focus on tools to do this stuff
Bro027_1459	s	But by having them both there ; The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you . ; Mm - hmm . ; And some of the time it 's going to hurt you ,
Bmr007_966	b	u Look , I I think this is a ; Really ? ; One once It 's a I used to work , like , on voiced on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this kind of thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1649	s	Well , there the And the other aspect of it is , um , that , when the microphone is not well - adjusted , then y i i even if it 's not a lapel mike , you can get lapel mike type behavior . ; Right . ; Cuz I 'm I 'm expecting , for example , with this , that you 're gonna end up , you know , picking up other peoples ' signals . ; I 've already written some notes here ,
Bmr002_1380	bk	Oh , I see . ; for bigger meetings . ; OK . ; I see .
Bed008_211	qy	Well ; Oh just uh accidentally erased this , ; I I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had " Is he staying in our hotel ? " , ; " Is he staying with friends ? " ,
Bmr012_1064	b	Well ; no they 'll just charge us more , ; so it 's this ; Mmm .
Bmr008_811	b	And then ; I mean , you really can't um ; Well ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_197	aa	and in addition to ; They 're doing some noise removal thing , ; right ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro005_524	b	Mm - hmm . ; It 's again better . ; So it 's eighty - nine point point one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1256	s	Is it useful ? ; Yeah ? ; Ye - Yeah . ; I mean , I remember when we were trying to put together all the ICSI software for the submission .
Bro028_76	s	OK . ; mmm ; Uh , yeah . So , the second thing is the system that we have currently . ; Oh , yes . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement ,
Bed012_775	cc	Yeah . ; And , um , ; The first bad version 'll be done in nine months . ; Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface
Bmr021_413	no	It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount . ; Exactly . Right right right right right . ; Well , is there is there is there a NIST routine which can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices ? ; I don't think so .
Bed005_1029	t3	New terminology ? ; Well , let me pick a random one ; Hmm ? ; I haven't heard that before .
Bmr011_333	s	Wonderful . ; Um , something I guess I didn't put in the list but , uh , on that , uh , same day later on in ; or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , ; uh , Dave Gelbart and I will be , uh , visiting with John Canny
Bmr009_1163	x	You know . ; " West " ; and I mean . ; Ye
Bmr015_371	b	Mm - hmm . ; so . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro005_370	s	Or , one million frames . ; And the multi - English is how much ? ; You have here the information . ; It 's one million and a half .
Btr001_154	b	Ah , yeah . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr025_382	%--	I think , I mean eh where ; yeah . ; Yeah , I mean I 'll be here . ; Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's
Bro027_624	b	Yep . ; Yeah , ; cuz the time constant of the on - line normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window , ; OK .
Bro026_894	s	Mm - hmm . ; That that seems to be kind of fundamental to it . ; Right . ; Um , and then the other thing , uh , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything ,
Bed015_373	%--	in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions . ; Right . ; And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . ; But you know , for now , I mean ,
Bed003_1789	bs	Um . So this this this is a parallel track , ; OK . ; you know , there they hopefully meet , ; So in other words this data collection is more general .
Bmr018_490	s	So I think they should be able to hear . ; The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not . ; So , I don't know . ; I don't know that you can locate them very well from the mixed signal ,
Bed016_148	s	Um , I don't I , uh I don't need it . ; so it 's OK . ; OK . ; Um , actually this is the the newest version after your comments ,
Btr001_2089	b	I would just be so worried that someone would cheat . ; You know , ; it 's sort of like a prisoners ' di prisoners ' dilemnas game , where you know , everyone 's wearing their blindfold but someone could just cheat and look , see what 's see what 's going on . ; That 's right .
Bro012_546	s	OK , so um I guess the argument one might make is that , " Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it . ; But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern , ; um ; I mean , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say .
Bro023_791	s	Well after that . ; So , ; uh ; so the other the other thing is like I 've been I 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum .
Bro024_359	ba	r But but but ; right . ; Uh , there 's been some discussion about whether the work we 're doing in that project is gonna be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both . ; And I think for this kind of discussion it matters .
Bmr011_494	%	the , uh the big arrays , ; uh , places , uh , like uh , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , ; uh , they have , uh , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . ; Xerox .
Bed006_908	bd	The ; wa wasn't there supposed to be a link in the ; Right . ; I don't know if this answers your question ,
Bmr014_866	%--	Really . ; You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . ; Because nob you ; know it
Bro012_1437	s	Yeah . ; Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing . ; But that was speaker - dependent actually . ; We were doing training on a particular announcer
Bmr003_1759	s	It l ou ; I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know , ; if you were trying to do a remembrance agent . ; But I think for meetings it 's probably alright .
Bro026_455	bk	So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . ; It 's depending on the same data as the other . ; Same data . ; OK .
Bmr024_628	%--	Right ? ; Is is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ? ; Yeah . ; What they
Bro019_1447	ar	That 's it . ; Suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place ? ; Is that out of the way ? ; Uh , no
Bmr012_947	s	but um ; good news also ; uh I got ; well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings
Bmr019_1698	%--	I think this is something that would need to be checked . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Th - the other thing I had actually was ,
Bmr019_1112	bk	They do ? ; Oh . ; Yes . ; Oh !
Bro018_878	b	But it looked like he had to give it uh ; even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it uh a front - end parameter file . ; Which talks about the kind of uh com computation that his mel cepstrum thing does , ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_280	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job . ; And that can be done , sort of to say , " OK now we 've picked these six tasks . " ; " Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . "
Bro003_405	bk	but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , " here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . " ; Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't . ; There 's you know , there 's fifty or something , ; Right .
Bed003_1517	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But ; That 's a different issue .
Btr001_2240	bk	uh , eh ; b but that 's not really an example of this , ; because they don't just say " so " . ; Right ,
Bro024_1537	s	Also it 's clear when you don't add noise , it 's much worse . ; Like , around five percent worse I guess . ; Uh - huh . ; And if you add too much noise it get worse also .
Bmr016_1763	s	Oh lan Oh OK - we OK ; Add what , Liz ? ; Yeah . ; it 's in the language model ,
Bmr008_1238	s	Nope . ; Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise , ; Mm - hmm . ; so that 's probably not sufficient .
Bro022_292	%--	Well , well ; So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . ; Mm - hmm . ; But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio
Bmr015_1216	s	One of the ; um , just to add to this ; one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them . ; I mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .
Bmr012_905	s	Yeah . ; And I have no idea what filter it 's using , ; so ; Telephone .
Bmr015_372	s	so . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; But they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers .
Bed013_453	qw	Oh ! Which Johno mentioned to me . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; And I just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence , " Where is the Powder - Tower " ,
Bed006_1630	ba	We will r ; Yeah . ; We will . ; Don't worry .
Bed008_1084	s	I mean it could be those are two separate things , ; it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as ; which would be my guess ; that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that um you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there ,
Bro014_860	%--	for unvoiced portion we have something tha that has a mean around O point three , ; and for voiced portion the mean is O point fifty - nine . ; But the variance seem quite high . ; How do you know ?
Bed014_571	s	The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , ; that they have admission fees , ; they have whatever . ; And then , this is We go via a thesaurus
Bro010_440	s	Begin to work . ; The reason for that was that , um , uh if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , ; uh , or one had a better VAD than the other ; since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task ,
Bmr019_1475	%--	You know , so that 's that 's something we can test . ; Right . ; So . ; Anyway .
Bmr003_2022	s	Great . ; No , ; we 're doing we 're doing great . ; I I was looking for the actual box I plan to use ,
Bmr029_297	s	Uh . ; Um . ; It 's probably more than a day , ; but probably less than two .
Bmr023_828	s	Exactly . Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK . So then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with .
Bmr012_1134	s	No that no no ; that 's a very ; if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work . ; I mean for the few times that you might wanna have that .
Bmr011_470	s	All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . ; OK . Well ; And , uh , it is related to ours . ; They were interested in ours .
Bro024_139	aa	Oh , o Oh , OK . ; So that 's that 's that 's standard . ; Um ; Yeah .
Bmr025_506	bk	OK . ; because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro027_951	no	um , ; Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ? ; Um , ; I don't know .
Bmr018_1485	b	So . ; Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked , ; but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about , ; Yep .
Bmr024_964	aa	Can't you just ; you just put them on ? ; So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ? ; Yeah .
Bed003_887	b	Oh it 's it affects th The " doing business " is certainly not . ; You could affect Theoretically you could affect " doing business " with " has door " . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr028_203	aa	No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript . ; A new transcript . ; Yep . ; Well , a new meeting , a transcript . Right .
Bns002_589	bk	So ; OK . ; So that was my question . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2223	ba	yeah . ; Huh . ; Yeah , ; interesting .
Bed005_115	s	So . ; w c sh should we move on to the technical sides ? ; Yep . ; Well I guess the good good news of last week was the parser .
Bed010_857	b	It was just this uh construction analyzer . ; Right . ; And so we think we think we have a shot at at that . ; OK .
Bro028_746	qy	Out of curiosity , what what kind of recognizer is the one from Mississippi State ? ; Uh , w what do you mean when you say " what kind " ? ; Is it ? ; Um , is it like a Gaussian mixture model ?
Bed011_659	2	Yep . ; So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment , ; " Dine out " is ; Socializing , I guess .
Bmr025_274	%--	Assuming we 're ; What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? ; Um ; we have
Bed006_1617	b	Yeah . ; Do feel that we have done our chores for this week ; or ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1181	b	so , you know you can say things like , " Well , this should probably not be on the record , but beep " ; OK , OK . ; I got that . ; Yeah .
Bro019_535	bk	there is a slight different . ; Uh ; I mean , which are extracted at the handset ; Yeah .
Bmr025_345	no	you know , you can show that graphically , sort of what the features are doing . ; It , you know , it doesn't work great but it 's definitely giving us something . ; Well I think ; I don't know if that would be of interest or not .
Bmr029_187	g	to use those segmentations , ; because th then we could claim that everything 's automatic . ; Do you know when he 'll have the the comparison ? ; Right .
Bro024_982	aa	Only Uh , only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase ; because it 's a it 's not a symmetric filter anymore . ; This is for the LDA ? ; Yeah
Bns003_334	aa	Huh ? ; Newbies . ; Newbies ? ; Yeah , OK .
Bro028_967	%--	So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . ; And , um , that , um , is is interesting , ; cuz , @ @ for for one thing , you could use it , um , in a a multi - scale way . ; You could have these
Bsr001_1912	b	So , it 's ; Really ? ; Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be . ; Oh , sure .
Bed006_1173	b	Right , right . ; Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; OK .
Bed002_1108	s	And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able We can couple .
Bro027_300	s	Cuz they have it ; Maybe I 'll send it to the list . ; Yeah . ; Cuz they have , uh , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what I feel .
Bmr010_648	b	as having that type of connector . ; But my guess is that Sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does . ; And and so ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1143	b	Maybe . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bmr001_272	s	Yeah . ; Certainly you can get some ; Well we could I mean . ; By the time We 'll have we 'll have data so we can actually you know , demonstrate that .
Bmr011_575	%--	because there 's a number of sites ; like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , ; um , but they 'll be recording with video ; and they 'll be
Bmr009_1496	b	No , the the one that 's installed is fine . ; It 's not slow at all . ; I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1299	%--	And cameras . ; and video , right . ; And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room , ; uh , the yeah the the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with
Bmr029_92	ba	Mm - hmm . ; But we don't know how much worse , ; Right . ; w w uh , which is certainly one interesting thing .
Bro004_106	bk	phonetically balanced uh data and task data . ; We only did either task task data or uh broad data . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_515	s	Mm - hmm . ; So th I 'm sure that we have , uh , fresh , you know , information on them . ; Right . ; Yeah . None of the e emails bounced , so I know they 're going somewhere .
Bro024_254	qw	And then you can yeah , you you can increase your window whi while you get while you are getting more samples . ; OK , ; um , ; and , um , so so in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ?
Bmr008_916	aa	Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff . ; I don't think you really have to do all that much . ; d I ; yeah .
Bmr002_624	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you guys are more expert on that , I mean , than I am , ; but I want to say that I know for a fact , I keep running across these , ; and those would be my first two choices of looking at . EAGLES and MATE .
Bro007_556	b	And and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features ; But ; rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1259	b	and and have ten other jobs running on different computers . ; So , it 's got to take that sort of thing , ; or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these . ; Yeah .
Bro022_908	bk	Yeah . ; So . ; But ; Yeah .
Bmr009_402	%--	He could You see , he already has all his stuff in place , ; Yeah . ; he has the histogram mechanism , ; he has the stuff that subtracts out
Bed014_993	s	Get a fresh start ; Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday er , take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping . ; Yeah , that 's another s thing . Yeah . ; But , um . I mean , there are also usually then holidays anyways .
Bro016_821	s	OK . ; And tho that 's what goes into HTK ? ; Uh , almost . ; But then you actually do a KLT on them .
Bro023_961	aa	Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin . ; Uh - huh . ; That is true . ; Nnn , yeah ,
Bmr009_126	s	How ; You didn't try to find speech ? ; No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel ; um sampled ten minutes randomly .
Bmr002_738	bk	But I mean Ni - i i i it as you said , it was easy to convert back and forth between um that file and STM format , ; in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data , and just made STM files out of it . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Btr001_2561	s	They have this really nice ; You know , it 's really ; Those sorts of things , i it 's true , ; you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships .
Bed008_124	ar	Think so . ; So here for example . ; You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ? ; Uh , no ,
Bmr008_889	b	I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr010_1232	s	We 're running a little short here . ; We , uh , uh , cou trying to ; That 's fine . ; I 'm finished .
Bmr025_262	s	My brain is not working , ; I don't remember who I 've been corresponding with . ; OK . ; Steve wro i it 's Ste - Steve Renals wrote THISL IR .
Btr002_2906	bd	Mm - hmm . ; That 's true . ; Mm - hmm . ; I should say , I didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions .
Bed011_1126	s	We done ? ; I have one bit of news . ; Good . ; Um , the action planner guy has wrote has written a a p lengthy proposal on how he wants to do the action planning .
Bsr001_2184	s	Yeah , ; I I mean , ; this this is something that re re requires a bootstrap . ; LDC is what we were thinking too .
Bro012_774	s	And it 's perfectly synchronized , ; so . ; And the sentence contain only one word , which is " Due " ; And it can't clearly be seen .
Bed015_377	aa	Yeah . ; But it y y it 's yeah , just moving it moving the c the cons the constraints around . ; uh , you know . ; M moving it to another place , right .
Bed010_138	s	Right . ; Right . ; You know ? ; Now , we 're we 're not committed for our research to do any of those things .
Bmr014_341	b	OK . ; So . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr014_164	s	And we have five , we 're getting one more . ; Yeah . ; And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , ; and then eight hundred per channel .
Bmr006_340	s	Right . ; And So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . ; Not enough for others , right . ; And so I 'm looking and thinking , " Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . "
Bmr022_448	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , th although ; " Beep . One thousand three hundred forty - two "
Bmr028_352	%--	Yeah . Pretty much . ; Yeah . ; Then the other issue related to that is data release . ; If we wanna show this in public , it should be releas
Bns001_842	s	Or is the application related to the network ? ; For my understanding and as far as we discussed , so such a long time uh , these applications should ; For instance , e - commerce . ; OK , OK , well , they will I didn't want to get a discussion now .
Buw001_946	aa	Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do . ; And so we try it out and see how it works . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bns001_344	s	I mean . ; uh ; What about the user who is switching from one let 's say zero - cost area network to another network where he has to pay . ; It is OK for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another .
Buw001_401	s	OK . So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , ; which is for someone else , ; as opposed to as a remembrance agent , ; which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be .
Bro014_177	t1	Uh - huh . ; or ? ; Uh , ; let 's see ,
Bed013_1234	aa	It 's a question that , um , queries on some particular thing X , ; and X is that location . ; There 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that . ; Yep . Yeah .
Bed003_31	t1	Johno , where are you ? ; OK . ; So , Let 's see . ; Which one of these buttons will do this for me ?
Bdb001_915	2	I think that there are quick and dirty solutions , ; and then there are long - term , big - infrastructure solutions . ; And so we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both . ; In the between ,
Bns001_778	s	and and maybe WaveLAN connection , here ; now a testbed ; and then then figure out that it works ? ; So , that 's my point .
Buw001_1478	s	If they 're real queries . ; Yeah . ; OK . So ; Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then uh , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to
Bed008_1293	s	Mm - hmm . ; What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is ; and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , ; so we want it to um add up to one ,
Bmr005_1474	b	Mm - hmm . ; And u I think routinely they would not do this . ; So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere ; Right .
Bmr029_717	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; Well , they grow them on trees now . ; I thought they were like mushrooms .
Bed003_930	co	Nope . ; Didn't do it . ; Oh . ; Oh wait ,
Bmr020_1717	b	I mean , what 're we gonna do ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1623	ar	Mmm . ; I haven't J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email , ; did he , ever ? ; No .
Bro024_485	s	And , uh , I didn't h ; I mean , I I found that the results ; I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit . ; So I was like looking into " why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? " .
Bro014_423	b	With what passing you ? ; With ; uh , I mean , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2436	aa	" Lipsmack " ! ; Yeah . ; Oh yes . ; Yeah .
Bro026_97	s	you you can set up priorities . ; You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . ; OK . ; Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS
Bmr010_329	%--	And and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And and I was just thinking that , um , if it were possible to bring that in , like , you know , this week ,
Bmr006_486	aa	And then they they get a CD , but just not the same day . ; Oh , right . ; If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bro011_616	%--	you know , the long ones versus the short ones . ; Mm - hmm . ; I d I did ; quickly , I did the silence model
Bed015_292	ba	Yeah . ; you 're right . ; A construction type . ; Uh , that 's fine .
Bmr024_1638	s	So first read the transcript number , and then start reading the digits . ; Sure . ; OK ? ; One , two , three .
Bed005_69	s	This The permission form . ; Mmm . ; Nuh . N . ; Uh , there has to be one ,
Buw001_218	s	There 's there 're sub - problems in that , ; Is that ; in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? ; I mean , that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then .
Bmr002_912	qy	This is the other think that um This is part of EAGLES , ; but um , ; but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this . ; Why do I feel like I 'm whispering ?
Bmr016_640	%--	and for me the lapel was OK . ; I mean I still ; and I don't know why . ; I 'm
Bro019_671	%--	I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So the
Bro023_1551	s	on the on on the bunch of uh fifty frames , right ? ; I see . ; Mmm . ; So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal ,
Bro011_558	%--	So look at the difference there ; and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . ; What which test set was this ? ; This is
Bed011_27	s	So , would you like to ; I think so . ; So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side . ; Commented and what they 're about and sort of the properties we may um give them .
Bns002_1478	s	And I hope we can use these remaining weeks to have really progress in uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before . ; Hmm - hmm . ; Because then I will make the advertising that is still worth to stay here , ; And I hope then Siemens will say OK for me to stay longer here .
Bed008_417	b	Yes . ; Yeah . ; So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_961	s	one of my friend . ; uh , ; Who 's the guy in Grenada ? ; Uh , Jose Carlos Segura .
Bro016_147	b	That , in fact , might have been part of what , uh , the difference was ; at least part of it that that we were seeing . ; Remember we were seeing the SRI system was so much better than the tandem system . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_1721	s	Yep . ; It wasn't said " TCL " . ; Sh - shouldn't it be " QUAL TICKLE " or something ? ; Of course .
Bed014_786	s	We 've been doing quite a bit of that . ; Yeah . ; Well I said . But that 's part of what the f ; We have many jobs for you , Ro - Robert .
Bro017_768	fa	Right ? ; Oop . ; The spread , ; Sorry .
Bmr006_217	s	It 's difficult . ; Yeah . ; OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get . ; I mean , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK ,
Bro013_482	s	For this one . ; For the noi ; this big , to here , they are to signal . ; This is for clean and this is for noise .
Buw001_1226	b	So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Right .
Bns003_259	bk	and should write based on the , uh , headlines in the project proposal the um things what still happened , the things what they have still in mind ; uh so that we can update these last @ @ you know @ @ present the last major part of the web pages . ; The pages are already on the web ? ; OK .
Bmr011_1013	co	so . ; Hmm . ; We 'll see . ; I mean , I think , th you know , they they they 've proceeded along a bit . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , uh , you know , have some more discussions with them .
Bsr001_405	t3	Yeah , ; that you really get you really get animals like ; Fascinating ! ; Wow .
Bed014_1073	bk	Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this . ; Yes . Yeah . ; That 's f fine with me . ; OK .
Bmr007_292	b	So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and and see . ; Uh - huh . ; Let 's say that in in second fifty - seven of one minute , you start talking and I start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds . ; Yep .
Bro012_688	b	No , I mean , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant , ; but I mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_1373	s	So this is uh step two . ; So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , ; right , ; whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable .
Bed014_1003	2	pretty flexible , I think . ; Yeah . There 's just sort of the two to four of us . ; So . ; The multiple meetings
Bro026_1074	b	Oh , sure , that 's really big . ; Yeah . ; Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are . ; Hmm .
Bmr002_537	aa	But . ; Well , if in terms of transcripts , sure , ; but in terms of speaker change it might be nice to get the actual time . ; Sure .
Bmr015_361	s	I didn't I don't think that 's true . ; Yeah , OK . ; Mmm . ; He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive
Btr001_2194	g	or j d expound on it . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it 's sort of a like you guys can take from here , ; you know ,
Bro028_293	%--	Yeah . ; while our system is currently at seven percent . ; Um , but what happens also is that if I listen to the , um a re - synthesized version of the speech ; and I re - synthesized this using a white noise that 's filtered by a LPC , uh , filter
Bro019_1345	%--	and ; Yeah . ; Or m e ; It was it was
Bed002_180	bk	so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . ; I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , ; so you will have to leave what you set . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1840	b	cuz they 're always , " Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm " Um , reacting . Yeah . ; Reacting . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bro003_558	s	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; So , ; it 's it 's definitely broader ,
Btr001_2312	b	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Like that . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr024_938	%--	well , not forever , ; they 've been finding even those degrade . ; Oh , I see . ; But , uh , the burned ones
Bmr028_1284	s	You never know . ; Suddenly the don they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore . ; No , but that 's what the pr ; Well , that 's what I 'm saying .
Btr001_2417	bk	It 's possible . ; Cuz I 've heard , um , Morgan do that . ; Exactly who I was thinking of actually . ; Yeah ,
Bro015_92	bk	How about the um the thing that you guys were working on before ; the uh Uh voiced - unvoiced ; uh ; Oh yes .
Bed002_576	s	But ; i Go go back to the the uh , th ; Yeah , that slide . ; So I w this is " onto " is is knowledge about buildings ,
Bsr001_1900	%--	That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation . ; That 's not hard . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think the hard part is getting enough training data and
Bmr005_831	s	uh , and ; Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . ; I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of ; That was that was exactly the notion that that that we discussed .
Bmr025_614	2	and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . ; Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna ; if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . ; Just just the monthly full .
Bmr026_931	%--	And that that that will probably help , actually , ; So it 's a little different ? ; because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um , um ; Just
Bro024_230	no	and , um , ; that 's sort of what we 're doing in this Aur - Aurora stuff . ; And , uh , ; it 's still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that looks like these things you 've trained up , because you always have the problem that it 's trained up for one condition and it isn't quite right for another .
Bmr012_1266	bk	Well that 's what I 'm thinking , ; And have ; yeah . ; Oh .
Bmr025_716	bk	So it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . ; Thank you . ; And so you have time and position stuff stored ; OK .
Bro013_195	s	let 's see , three for this ? ; Yeah . ; Sure , but I mean , ; um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that .
Bns002_175	bk	OK . ; And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network . ; Thank you , Joe . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_1118	bk	The infrastructure , yeah , they th they were paid ; Yeah . ; but they don't expect anything in return . ; Right .
Bmr026_672	bk	No . ; If we talked about it in this meeting . ; He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . ; OK .
Bed003_1047	s	Maybe it was just ; Oh ! ; Oh . ; W Ah , it was dead . To the world .
Bmr030_452	ba	Hmm . ; Yep . ; and ; Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy .
Bmr011_117	s	Well , so ; uh , well one thing I was gonna say was that , um , i we could get more , uh , of the head mounted microphones ; even beyond the number of radio channels we have ; because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order .
Bed010_769	%	Yeah , ; right . ; Have you hav y h had this ? ; The
Bed013_583	%--	That would be hard . ; Well I uh maybe it 's just four thousand lines . ; I mean it 's still it 's still ; I do I don't They don't want any
Bed014_706	s	I mean it th I can thi I can think of arguments in either direction on that . ; But somehow you want to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , it 's just another , sort of , construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history
Bro028_917	s	but ; Yeah . ; I guess he 's gonna , maybe ; Well , he 's got it anyway ,
Btr001_781	b	Uh , it 's like " fff " , " sss " . ; Or " sss " . ; Or ; Yeah .
Bns002_1163	s	And in the beginning , the first adaptors uh ; Oops ! ; were only one and two megabytes per second , ; but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh , the new eleven megabytes per second version
Bro025_701	b	Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John . ; Mm - hmm . ; He said , uh , um , these these phonological features are are sort of figments of imagination also . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_686	s	You did you have , uh , something in the report about , uh , about , uh , for f uh , forced alignment ? ; Have you have you started on that ? ; Oh , well , yeah , so I 've been struggling with the forced alignments . ; Um . So the scheme that I drew on the board last time where we tried to , um allow reject models for the s speech from other speakers ,
Bmr020_362	aa	so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow , ; um , and this is the time bin that we used , ; then of course you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here . ; Right .
Bro023_847	bk	Oh ! ; Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ? ; o ; Yeah .
Bmr016_941	b	Yep . ; Right . ; we would like to ; Yeah .
Bro013_582	b	it 's , ; yeah , it 's it 's another problem . ; and the ; Yeah
Bro028_225	%	like so , these things are like hav having a better VAD . ; Uh , we have some ideas about that . ; It would probably implies working a little bit on features that are more suited to a voice activity detection . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_98	s	Right ? ; But it ends at this T - eighteen , ; which may be somewhere else . ; We say there 's another utterance .
Bro026_768	%--	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , um . ; In fact , I mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable
Bro017_135	b	So eh they agreed , and so they said " OK , we will discuss that . " ; Immediately Nokia uh raised the question ; and they said " oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1273	aa	Cuz it 's just hard to do . ; This is This is Bever 's Bever 's effect , ; when where In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear , ; Y Yeah .
Bed014_1413	aa	Right . ; So Friday , ; Monday ; Yeah .
Bns002_216	ba	OK ? ; So that 's why we cannot allow several transmitters in the same channel at the same time . ; OK ? ; So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one .
Bmr029_964	s	So ; OK . ; So . Rrrrr - rrrrm ; Something like that .
Bmr028_894	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Do you assume you know the speaker when you do this ? ; I want us to assume the exac whatever it was you assumed when you did the other the the close mike .
Bmr025_962	s	Yeah . ; Because we we you know , we we haven't used it at all . ; We c ; We have some aspirations of using them
Bro015_58	b	Sounds like they 're still arguing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , they 're still not decided . ; Yeah .
Bro018_573	b	Right . ; So , the the simple idea behind a support vector machine is um , you have you have this feature space , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_571	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You guys didn't have o one channel per person before ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_360	no	because we do we do , uh , uh , mel filter bank , for instance . ; Yeah , but is it that is it that different , I mean ? ; Right ? ; Um , I don't know what mel , uh , based synthesis would sound like ,
Bmr026_529	b	Yeah . ; So they don't want to stack up external drives . ; Um And then they want everything else in the machine room . ; Right .
Bro003_281	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah , perhaps yeah , there is also TIMIT . ; We could use TIMIT . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_958	s	Right . ; So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them . ; Well , if if if you if they last ; Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case ,
Bmr031_1100	%--	That 's why we can't just annotate the transcripts , uh , one listening to one at a time . ; Mm - hmm . ; So so that 's why the Transcriber 's nice for sort of listening to it , ; but you can't actually encode , um encode someth
Bmr003_1031	ar	D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for uh , TV ? ; OK . ; Right . ; No .
Bed004_808	s	No . ; Well , no the Bayes the Bayes - nets ; The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . ; But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the uh general .
Bns001_605	s	Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah ! ; And then from Nokia I came to this that project ,
Bro027_1473	b	Right . ; Um , ; and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA . ; Right .
Bmr010_198	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's it . ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Bmr007_369	s	And and there well may be , but ; What what I what I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too i too imprecise . ; But what I mean is that , um in Switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . ; And what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap
Bmr010_756	s	I mean , I think ; I don't want to make people self - conscious . ; Stop breathing ! ; It it 's going to be imperfect .
Btr001_647	no	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I don't know . ; I don't know if that 's actually true
Bmr026_172	s	so , right now it 's just an X Waves ; and then you have three windows ; but I don't know , it looked pretty nice ; and I 'm sure it think it has potential for a little something ,
Bro023_1393	bk	it 's it 's added . ; It 's additive . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed008_588	b	Good . ; Right . ; So now we 're looking for user related things that um ; Yeah .
Bro027_987	bk	Um . ; The reason I did it this ways is that in February , it we we tested different things like that , ; so , having two KLT , having just a KLT for a network , or having a global KLT . ; Oh , I see .
Buw001_503	b	but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries . ; Well , yeah . That 's true too . ; And then it 's you know , it 's kind of a key . ; Hmm .
Bmr029_643	s	Right . So , somehow the ; Assuming he uses the new naming scheme , then he should call the waveforms ; the so , the waveform names have the , you know , meeting meeting ID , ; and the microphone ,
Btr001_1732	s	um ; You can hear , there 's like . ; You know , ; it , like something like that .
Btr002_2776	s	Yeah . ; It 's like , " OK , well they just it 's in the wrong ; It 's just in the wrong place . ; That person 's not talking at all " .
Bns001_1085	s	So they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ASCII bytes that can rescr refresh the screen with a different animation every , well , second , a few times . ; Yeah . ; So , that 's that 's true . ; I immediately agree .
Btr002_1371	b	Mm - hmm . ; And then there was some conversation in addition , that that , um , needed to be transcribed . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_309	co	Anyth - any other uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? ; uh we so we now know I think , what the landscape is like . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we just push on and and uh , do what we need to do .
Bro003_1382	co	So , ; OK , ; Oh , also that ; so let 's start over .
Bed005_907	%--	So eh Yeah . ; So , what happened is , ; there 's this , eh , uh ; Robert was describing
Bro014_363	ar	I would try to weight things depending on the exact environment that I was gonna be using the system in . ; If I ; But but No . ; Well , no
Bmr018_1516	%--	well , it 's a big company , ; I didn't I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative , ; Yeah . ; but i i i
Bmr006_1093	b	I 've got a question . ; Interesting . ; This ; Hmm .
Bro014_388	s	So not try to combine them . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Uh , actually it 's true .
Btr002_351	s	Oh . ; but that would be cool . ; That 'd be nice . ; No , what I meant was that I would hope that , for meetings in English you would have native speakers transcribing it
Bed008_1044	b	But uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? ; Mm - hmm . ; But I think trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much . ; OK .
Bed006_421	b	and you want to do some ; and and and there 's a person looking at pictures . ; So , you know , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures . ; Right .
Bro004_1278	s	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh . So , OK , ; So I think this brings me up to date a bit .
Bro027_401	bk	Oh . ; Uh , he he , uh he was here for a couple years ; and he , uh got his PHD . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr011_109	s	it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So And I also talked to Mari this morning
Bmr006_1199	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; But no , you 're absolutely right . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1841	%--	Reacting . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; It just occurred to me ,
Bmr013_875	s	but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , ; and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase ; but that 's OK . ; And then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers .
Bro027_1073	b	From zero to clean . ; Yeah . ; So we found this this , uh this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_923	s	When you get the mel When you go to the mel scale . ; Right . ; Yeah , ; it 's bark scale ,
Bmr024_300	b	And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . ; You just you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . ; And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh better coverage of the backchannels , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_496	s	So I was thinking ; Right . ; Yeah . ; the problem is when you run , uh , if you run a regular dictionary , um , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations ,
Bro022_682	b	Yeah . ; And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone ; test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits , ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1044	bk	and then he laughs , ; Web master . ; but it really " web master " . ; Oh . Uh - oh .
Bed004_546	s	you have an action , " pppt ! " ; You do that . ; Um , then the question would be ; Uh Now , if that 's all you 're doing , then you can get the types from the ontology ,
Bmr019_1947	aa	Mmm . ; so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings . ; The grouping . ; Yeah .
Bed006_340	s	Based on the web site , ; yeah , at the ; Oh OK ; there 's a web site
Bed008_310	s	but the design we had was ; there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations ; mm - hmm ; so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes
Bmr002_423	s	You have You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them . ; I 'm not using them anymore . ; I used to use them . ; So they 're currently set up for Shift , Control , and Alt .
Bmr019_1027	s	just the dyadic ; But in addition , you know , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what what the answer is that this that the the answerer 's given ; H ; I tell you , I say I say " uh - huh " a lot ,
Bmr007_502	b	It 's interesting , ; so if you watch people are going like Right right , like this here , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro005_217	s	but uh use of Italian training in Italian digits for PLP only ? ; Uh yes ? ; Uh yeah , ; so this is basically this is in the table .
Bmr016_743	s	OK . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , ; so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on .
Bmr027_114	aa	I mean , it 's almost all us . ; I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one . ; Was my was my response OK ? ; That 's right .
Buw001_274	aap	Good point . ; Yeah . ; And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? ; I mean , that gives you a summary
Bro024_542	%--	looking in the lower right - hand corner , ; " fifty percent relative performance " . ; For the clean training . ; Is that
Bmr026_575	b	Attach to ; Popcorn . ; To the machine that collects the data . ; Yeah ?
Bed003_779	s	If we create something that for example would be um ; So th some things can be landmarks in your sense ; but they can never be entered ? ; So for example s a statue .
Bdb001_200	s	Lattices are big , too . ; and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values ; depending on ; Yeah , I mean , for something like that I would use P - file
Btr002_2104	ba	Oh , oh . ; It would just intru it was an intrusion . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , that 's funny .
Bed015_243	s	but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . ; So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , " are you of type is this part of type whatever " , um , the " designates " tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . ; OK , so if you have like " the big red ball " , you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun . ; Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase .
Bro012_1510	s	Sorry . ; So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which um , you know , had it 's separate path for each length digit string you could get . ; So there was a one - long path ; and there was a four - long and a five - long
Bro024_569	s	So n s So since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with , it 's easier to get a better relative improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I do .
Bmr019_885	bk	So . ; Uh , if we We have two . ; We have two . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_534	b	It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . ; I see . ; Fine . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_663	g	But it 's some other data we have , ; and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bdb001_912	s	And that would that would do it , ; I mean , for me . ; Yeah . ; I think that there are quick and dirty solutions ,
Bmr003_2579	s	that 's true ; but we haven't spent that , right ? ; But once we once we 've done the intellectual part of these , uh , we can just knock them out , right ? ; Cheap .
Bro023_1398	s	OK . ; We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection . ; Uh - huh . ; And we can do that in parallel with some other filtering you can do .
Bmr022_873	%--	And and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as , you know , ; and nobody will remember how to ; Another one just bit the dust . ; yeah , nobody will remember how to repair a Jimbox or a Jimlet or a
Bmr013_299	s	but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . ; Uh , he didn't know what to say , about , what is the sequence of phones there . ; They came up with some compromise . ; Because that really wasn't what it look like .
Bro018_231	b	I should I can't show that . ; OK . ; But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_450	s	and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit , ; but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched . ; And so I think that if what you 're if the goal of this is to come up with robust features , it does mean ; So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all ,
Bed003_1522	aa	Hmm ? ; I I want to see what it does with uh " landmark - iness " . ; That 's ; Yeah .
Bmr011_386	b	No , ; he did start on it . ; e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2203	ba	uh , and then she then she said something ; and he says , " Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . " ; Oh wow . ; Yeah , it 's pretty interesting . Pretty interesting .
Bmr010_1016	2	I remember s thinking " oh , that 's not correctly pronounced " . ; But it but I thought it 's not worth fixing ; cuz often when you 're speaking everybody knows what what you mean . ; You 'll self - repair .
Bro019_1096	s	That 's cool . ; OK . ; but we 're hop ; uh , actually uh , Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data .
Bns001_768	s	th there 's a lot of potential , as I believe , for for uh certain research work . ; But the question is , first of all , " Do we have the competence to do something like that ? " ; First of all . ; Second , we are not hardware builders , in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems .
Bns002_1196	s	For the ; no . ; Eleven - B is only for for uh radio ; and it 's only for uh direct sequences spread spectrum .
Bmr026_929	s	Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far . ; Yeah . ; And that that that will probably help , actually , ; So it 's a little different ?
Bro012_835	b	Why why do it ? ; Uh . ; Well , I mean , because everything uh If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_825	b	uh , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished . ; Mm - hmm . ; One is when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they 're in the middle of a sentence . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_207	s	set the negative values to zero . ; So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive , ; which is the time trajectory of energy , ; um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things .
Bro017_306	b	right ? ; They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_288	qw	It 's not really echo but uh just um uh ; taking the input from other mikes and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . ; So . ; Um what was it ,
Bro014_11	s	Channel three . Alright . ; OK , ; did you solve speech recognition last week ? ; Almost .
Bmr025_399	b	I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data ; so it might be neat , you know . ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bmr028_996	2	And you can s ; Yeah . ; No , actually , what Here 's here 's what we would usually do u under these circumstances . ; And pick whichever 's better .
Bro007_49	2	Yeah . ; And then the KLT and then the two together again . ; No , the KLT . ; And those two together .
Bmr024_582	b	Cuz at first they weren't they weren't sa ; Well , this was this was the question . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_724	b	we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts ; Great . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_997	s	Roughly ? ; Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error . ; And uh it was ; I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for .
Bmr020_1433	s	There are lots of ways to do it . ; I have one program that 'll do it . ; Yeah . ; You can find other programs .
Bmr010_1464	s	And then you have a Markov model for each ? ; Um ; I 'm not sure . ; I I thought about , uh , adding , uh , uh , another class too .
Bro008_579	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Good point . ; Yeah ,
Bmr012_535	s	Mm - hmm . ; and and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system ; and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . ; So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no tailoring at all .
Bro007_307	b	and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence . ; So we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . ; I see . ; OK .
Bro021_913	%--	Yeah . ; And then , ; And the noise signal . ; uh So that 's log of X plus log of one plus , uh
Bmr005_409	qrr	Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?
Bed009_99	s	Great . ; So , you guys enjoy your weekend ? ; Yes , very much so . ; Yeah , very much
Bro014_1525	s	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's ; um , ; certainly in a short short - term this just sounds easier .
Bro023_1749	aa	The energy . ; Yeah . Of course . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , right .
Bed016_946	qw	Onward . ; Just beyond that . ; How much does it cost ? ; Where is the castle ?
Bro003_256	no	and some of it 's ; I mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm not sure if . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out
Bro008_517	b	Right . ; Uh , something wrong , perhaps in the just in the the fact that the labels are ; well ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_298	s	Right . ; Um . ; So ; So , although I I sort of know how to run it , there are a little a f few details here and there that I 'll have to dig out .
Bmr016_704	b	Um . ; But , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_558	s	But he yeah , he 's he 's right , ; y I mean maybe ; you weren't intending to pause at all , ; but You were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds ,
Bmr031_253	s	Yeah . ; Right . Yeah . ; I mean , you could have some parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't , ; It 's it 's sort of like in , um , Broadcast News
Bed006_556	b	when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary , then we can actually a put it all together ; Mm - hmm . ; So the speech recognizer also works . ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_1150	ar	because then it I you know , I 'm gonna gonna be hobbling a little slowly . ; Then you don't have to rush . ; Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ? ; Hnh - nn .
Bro028_569	b	on the m more mismatched conditions . ; OK . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed008_189	%--	let 's forget it . ; Well that 's fine . ; Well anyway , go ahead . ; OK , and so this , oh that
Bsr001_2167	s	Mari or or or Katrin , or Jeff , or ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , both I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this .
Bed014_1254	b	Mm - hmm . ; Well , if you if you do wanna discuss focus background and then get me into that ; because I mean , I wo I w scientifically worked on that for for almost two years . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1565	aa	Yeah . ; I think that 's true . ; Maybe . ; Yeah , absolutely .
Bed013_1246	%--	OK , the next one would be here , just for mood . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; The next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh
Bro028_816	%	and and they adjust the distribution . ; Right . ; So you you have the distributions from the training set , ; N
Bmr018_260	s	I mean , h they they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ? ; Hmm , I gue hmm . ; I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting . ; I would think ,
Bro018_298	s	I see . ; Yeah . ; Well there 's gonna be it looks like there 's gonna be a noisy uh some large vocabulary noisy stuff too . ; Somebody 's preparing .
Bmr019_627	bk	H h ; He 's he 's sort of back , ; but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today . ; Oh , OK .
Bro016_341	bk	Yeah . ; Mainly working on what ? ; On the report of the work that was already done . ; Oh .
Bmr008_189	b	I mean , so what would you suggest ? ; I don't know . ; I 'm just That 's why I was wondering about if you can put something about the d ; Right .
Bns001_308	s	I 'm not sure about it . ; It could be . ; Mmm . ; I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies .
Bed013_677	ba	No , that 's ; Yeah , that 's what it means . ; Hhh ! ; OK , cool .
Bro023_1599	aa	Yeah . ; Actually , th the best system that we still have is , uh , our system but with their noise compensation scheme , ; right ? ; Right .
Bro021_116	%--	Wasn't there some experiment you were gonna try ; where you did something differently for each , um , uh I don't know whether it was each mel band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or someth ; There was something you were gonna uh , some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency . ; I don't know if that was
Bro016_862	s	I would think . ; And , uh ; Yeah . ; It may be entirely off
Bmr015_825	s	but , um , ; other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon . ; And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope . ; The higher frequencies will be lower energy .
Bmr012_593	s	It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , ; if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK ; but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . ; So that 's about it .
Bed011_844	s	Go the normal way ? ; Whatever that again means , er or do you does the person wanna rough it ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean th so there 's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things
Bns002_253	%--	OK , ; eh , this problem is what is called ; Oh , sorry . ; uh , the
Bmr015_1077	s	there 'll be a master transcript ; which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the one that 's used for speech recognition will be processed via scripts .
Bro023_220	b	OK . ; you know , they 'll say something first . ; And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , " excuse me ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_1052	s	so that means we have to read the transcript script number and then the numbers , ; and if there 's a new line , a short break . ; And , afterwards we have to , ; uh , that device is switched on ,
Bmr030_397	s	So one of the things that we did is , Adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want , uh , basically , uh , chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty - five minutes . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then we can give those to IBM ; and it 'll make it easier for them to put them on tape .
Buw001_954	ba	It 's just ; Right . ; OK . ; I think , though , the importance marking is a good idea , though .
Bed006_1705	s	OK , great uh - huh . ; it 's an an it 's it 's sort of ; Not just that you want to go from here to here , ; it 's that the action is what you intend
Btr001_1786	aa	Oh , yeah . ; Mmm . ; Oh yeah , ; mm - hmm .
Bmr027_741	ba	Right . Exactly . I see . ; It wouldn't be that hard to hide it . ; Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true . ; See , this is good .
Bed012_394	co	And now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that , ; that looks at all the values and says , " The winner is Timing . ; Now , go there . " ; " Uh , go there , Timing , now . "
Bdb001_919	b	right . ; And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away , ; Um ; Right .
Bro023_1462	aa	Same thing for the shape of the the noise . ; Maybe it would be better to add just white noise instead of speech shaped noise . ; That 'd be more like the JRASTA thing in a sense . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_780	s	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's very good . ; Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though ,
Bsr001_1452	b	Yes . ; Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too ; even though that 's not what I 'm normally gonna be collecting , ; Right .
Bmr012_751	s	Resample . ; yeah . ; Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms . ; RSMP .
Bmr006_515	s	See you . ; OK . ; See you . ; So , uh Let 's see .
Bmr016_1351	no	Right . ; So - c I haven't listened to it ; Uh , is that like someone 's like burning or some such thing ? ; so I don't know .
Bro016_854	%--	Yeah . ; No . Again you don't really look at that . ; It 's something that , ; and then it 's going through this transformation that 's probably pretty close to
Bro026_136	b	Cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , uh , he would come here this week and and we would sort of ; Uh - huh . ; Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1453	s	Um . ; The other thing one could do is Couldn't ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , it 's So you have two categories
Bmr003_2604	qw	Good . ; I can move my thumb now . ; That 's a great idea . ; What ?
Bmr031_539	ba	but there were definitely above , like , twenty . ; Whew . ; Yeah . ; That 's funny .
Bmr025_295	g	Yeah . ; Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts um eh you know , from speaker to speaker . ; And if it doesn't ; Right ?
Bro027_742	aa	so this is this is like the first proposal . ; The proposal - one . ; It was forty - four , actually . ; Yeah .
Bro013_433	b	So , something that 's similar to the proposal too , but with MSG stream . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr011_1813	s	Mm - hmm . ; because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will ; for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , ; because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features .
Bed015_759	b	Yeah . ; And so , um , the like if you said he ; you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_787	s	I think we should , because other databases do . ; It 's sort of a political thing . ; And there are some general ; like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category .
Bro012_771	s	And I plotted this for two channels . ; Channel zero is the close mic microphone , ; and channel one is the distant microphone . ; And it 's perfectly synchronized ,
Bed004_447	s	Yeah . ; I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting , but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are . ; So , if you have some bottom line uh decision about which mode , ; you know , what are the most relevant things .
Bmr002_953	co	Uses what ? ; It uses Snack . ; That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with . ; OK , then we 'll have to use it .
Bmr005_389	qw	For ; So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , ; and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . ; How many events would that be ?
Bmr022_1464	s	And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in , they 'll check it out once , ; Yep . ; they 'll make all the changes , ; they 'll never tell us about the changes ,
Bmr026_1162	no	Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . ; And how How many hours is that ? ; That 's why I was ; I I 'm not sure how much that is .
Bro011_667	%--	And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , ; so . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um
Bro012_712	b	Mm - hmm . ; So I mean you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say " Oh yeah . ; This this really distorted it quite a bit . " ; Yeah .
Bmr026_771	aa	And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end . ; Mmm . ; For both females and males ? ; Yes .
Bmr020_918	b	w and we know that . ; OK . ; Wel - uh we just wanna if if there 're any major differences between doing it on the hand ; Uh - huh .
Bmr010_843	no	Yeah . ; actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know , is pretty good . ; So as long as you can stick a you know , a t a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter , ; Oh , I didn't know that .
Bed004_863	s	b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever , ; so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , ; that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately . ; Should be decoupled , yeah .
Buw001_241	s	t See ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting ; There we go .
Bro019_1243	s	Mmm . ; But I I I have to tell you , ; I can't remember the conference , ; but , uh , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences
Bro024_1756	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah , you you caught up . ; because ; Yep ,
Bro024_575	%	Yeah . ; Yeah , if we look at the figures on the right , we see that the reference system is very bad . ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bro005_150	aa	So it 's not the Again we switch to another ; Yes , and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two . ; Baseline is eighty - two . ; Yeah
Bmr006_1115	no	fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . ; OK . ; Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start . ; And , I don't know
Bro023_59	s	We didn't meet last week , Morgan . ; Um , I went around and talked to everybody , ; and it seemed like they they had some new results ; but rather than them coming up and telling me I figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know , all of us .
Bro025_359	ba	I mean , sounds like we probably will . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; That 'd be good .
Bmr015_236	bd	and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions , ; Do something different , ; yeah . ; but this is the next suggestion ,
Bsr001_2385	aa	Mm - hmm . ; because then you can get this F zero floor for each of the speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , right ,
Bmr003_1615	b	and I keep them to a uh , limited set ; because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , you know , versus " um " . ; So I just always wrote it as U M . ; And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five .
Bed005_749	qw	Well How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? ; We sort of t think that our bit in this problem is interesting , ; but , just to get from Powder - Tower to an object I ID in a database is also not really trivial . ; Or or if you take something even more scary , um , " how do I get to the third building after the Tower ?
Bro024_198	s	maybe if you get something that sounds that that 's does a pretty job at that . ; Yeah . ; Well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into . ; You could imagine that .
Bro004_1444	x	Um . So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings , no matter what , ; OK . ; for a lot of the things we 're doing , ; whereas , w exactly which HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend uh
Bmr031_1081	b	But we can talk about it . ; Yeah . ; because here 's the thing . We 're sort of we 're starting to move from transcription to annotation . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1037	s	you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this . ; Well , I think if ; Maybe e Is email easier ? ; I mean , I when you first said do do it , um , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up
Bns002_291	bk	OK . ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; OK ,
Bed008_100	s	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe
Bro005_928	b	So . And and when you add other things in to to broaden it , it gets worse uh typically . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_124	b	Yeah , but One one dimension . ; Yeah . ; And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1212	b	if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way ; um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes ; uh , I don't know if that might be ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_991	s	OK . ; OK . ; And then I 'll also re - number ; so that , uh , the mikes are in order .
Bmr016_423	bd	It 's the P - make of digit reading . ; Well Well OK . Well let 's try it . ; That 's right . ; I I mea I 'm I was sort of serious ,
Bmr009_1156	qh	That 's a joke . ; That 's ; So let 's make it up . ; S I mean , who cares .
Bro026_414	s	right ? ; Yeah . ; So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . ; There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not .
Btr002_1197	b	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_858	%	What ? ; I 'm sorry , I haven't . ; Not on purpose . ; in here
Bed005_936	b	Right . ; And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things . ; That 's great ! ; Right .
Bed008_1109	b	And four you we can handle . ; No . ; It 's too much ? ; Yeah .
Bmr029_695	s	which is a good thing . ; Because this method might estimate the mean badly , if it had to face long silence periods . ; But that does mean that I need as much I need twice as much disk space as the original set ; cuz I need while I 'm running it cuz I need to create this intermediate set , um , of these big files ,
Bmr021_925	s	You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards so that they 're uh orthogonal . ; uh ; Right . ; So you 'd wanna do a linear transform also .
Bmr031_371	s	Um . Well , I got a email from one of the UW guys . ; They want to record the meetings at higher , uh , sampling rate than sixteen kilohertz . ; Uh , ; I didn't ask why .
Bns001_1766	bd	And so I really ; if somebody has an idea send an email ; and then I would like to enforce everybody ; not that I 'm doing everything
Bro026_680	aa	Uh , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks . ; That 's it . ; So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_1504	s	OK , that 's it for spectral subtraction . ; The second thing I was working on is to , um , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection . ; Um , ; and for this I u simply used some code that , uh , I had from from Belgium ,
Bmr011_970	bk	And that 's that 's my email to him . That needs to be forthcoming . ; Yeah . ; Cuz ; OK .
Bro028_807	s	Yeah . ; I didn't see the poster . ; Yeah . ; Um It was something similar to n on - line normalization finally
Bed010_522	s	um , now that was the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction ; he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , " your bike is parked across the street " ; and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , " well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike " , ; but um in in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of " where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree " .
Bmr023_386	s	Yeah . ; But it happened to be during that time I needed one , ; so I so I started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours ; and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available .
Bro027_1254	%--	the " highly mismatched " means that the ; Clean training and ; Uh , sorry ? ; It 's clean training
Bmr026_477	b	Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . ; So . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bed008_1437	%--	OK . ; Alright , right . ; Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net ; or
Bmr024_621	s	or they 're different s speakers . ; B ; Right . ; So so so for their usage , they don't need anything .
Btr002_2656	bk	Yeah . ; And so it 'll be that ; s Yeah . I was gonna say , I put ; OK .
Bed013_1257	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Where it was ; the simulation that 's , according to it you know , that that corresponds to it , and as well the as discourse ,
Bmr027_598	s	So . ; Well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be . ; I mean , because they they filled out a contact information ; and that 's where I 'm sending the information .
Bmr003_2051	no	I mean , the the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . ; I 'll - I 'll show you the the cro ; this is the table cross section . ; I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at .
Bmr024_342	qy	I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . ; And and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet . ; Uh . ; And , um , there 's the issue that that they we know what what was said , but do we ?
Bdb001_385	s	Yeah . ; And especially for the prosody work , what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal , ; and of course those change every time your alignments change . ; So you re - run a recognizer ,
Bmr003_2190	s	Exactly . ; This this box ; Oh , I didn't understand ; That being the wiring box .
Bro004_219	b	But uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent . ; So I was just I just trying to understand that . ; Yeah . ; Sure .
Bmr009_1609	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; However . I also understand that you can have widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1658	b	Well , welcome . ; Thanks . ; I guess we should do digits quickly . ; Mmm .
Bmr028_1037	s	Well , I think there 're lots of lots of ways of doing it . ; They 're both picked up in the clustering , I guess . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , before you do the clustering to rule out those those types of things .
Bmr028_386	ba	Good . ; But if you search your name , you 'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name . ; So th ; That 's great .
Bmr010_255	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . So , um , ; um , I spoke I had a meeting with Dave Gelbart on on and he had , uh , excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation . ; But , um , he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already , um , existing interfaces which might already have these properties .
Bmr001_376	b	So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps . ; Yeah . ; So we can do some more recordings but there 's there 's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month , say . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro005_408	%--	And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we have a l little bit less result than the the the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . ; Maybe if when we have the new the new neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta ,
Bro010_918	s	Uh , the third thing I like about it is , ; uh , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit ; but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , ; um , this issue of where the targets come from .
Btr002_2646	%	So that 's OK ? ; Well done . ; Actually , it 'd be a " laugh " ; transcribed ?
Bmr018_425	aa	That w ; Well it it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly , ; But you can cancel that . ; yeah .
Bns001_1122	s	Yes , that 's right . ; And do you have some comments on it ; from the next this is version zero dot five right , yeah . ; Yeah , but I 'd rather like to follow the discussion before I gave any comments ,
Bro012_945	s	Is it applied here or a after the variance normalization ? ; Hmm ? ; Spectral subtraction , I guess . ; It 's applied before variance normalization .
Bsr001_368	b	Yeah . ; I don't know . ; Right , ; OK .
Bro012_1213	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise ; Yeah .
Btr002_1874	ba	Aw ! ; and then , " This sound must be this sound ! ; Oh . ; Oh wow .
Bro005_415	s	Actually , just to be some more ; Do ; This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the ; Yes , yeah , I mean it can't be compared with the other
Bro023_205	s	OK . ; Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time . ; I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway . ; And so you may may just want to think of it as a filter .
Bmr006_835	s	We just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past .
Btr002_426	x	Right . " Fff " . Because it 's ; Maybe the " P " wasn't pronounced very well , ; Yeah ? ; " Pss " .
Bro021_834	s	Another thing is the , em the codebook , ; the initial codebook . ; That maybe , ; well , it 's too clean
Bed009_472	%--	Mmm . ; Yep . ; And um mmm You don't know ; OK th
Bns003_116	aap	Could we wait until the network is running ? ; Because currently it 's not possible , uh , based on certain fire wall constraints . ; Yeah . ; At the moment .
Bmr028_1742	s	Yeah . ; cuz otherwise we 'll end up with very few meetings . ; Right . But may just ; there 's there 's no shortage of meetings ,
Bro028_611	%	Hmm . ; It wasn't on the conference call this morning ? ; No . ; Hmm .
Bns001_530	d	u ; Uh Don't know . ; Palo Alto ? ; Mountain View ?
Bmr012_241	b	yeah . ; So you guys know . ; S sorry I haven't seen the email , ; Yeah .
Bed010_828	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; It it follows . ; Yeah .
Bro026_71	s	Oh , good ! ; Great ! ; Oh . ; But it 's So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH .
Bns003_958	s	because they are still not able to deal with Multicast , ; they still have there that tunnel generations and all those kind of things ; and I I believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the really uh , mobile scenarios in in that network , ; so but anyway we have to live with a real situation
Bed003_1232	s	So instead of single node , for like , if they said the word " admission fee " ; Exactly . ; Yeah . ; " admission fee " , or maybe , you know , " how much to enter "
Bro023_1621	b	I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction . ; OK . ; So I 'm also using that n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_849	s	but with the mel cepstral features . ; Sort of , you know , back up from the system that he had . ; I thought he said he was gonna ; I have to look back through my my email from him .
Bro017_464	bk	I assume so . ; Hmm . ; Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data . ; Wow .
Bro026_268	b	And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1201	no	yeah , yeah . ; So , you don't need da data enough to cover uh , nearly as much stuff . ; I mean ; I don't know .
Bmr030_357	s	Didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers ? ; Yeah , it 's done now . ; And , how was it ? ; She said it was much faster .
Buw001_502	s	Yeah . ; but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries . ; Well , yeah . That 's true too . ; And then it 's you know , it 's kind of a key .
Bro003_1116	b	Database three . ; In one net . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1038	no	Yeah . ; Yeah , I don't know . ; There are they have there is no ; I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State ,
Bro021_245	s	Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database . ; Mm - hmm . ; If if you compare th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n n n the MFCC are not very different . ; They are very different when energy 's lower ,
Bed015_252	aa	" the r the " , um , " big red ball " , ; and the entity denoted by the word " ball " is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element . ; A a and the ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1308	s	How long does it take , just briefly , like t to OK . to label the , ; No . ; I have the script now , ; so , I mean , it can work off the , uh other thing ,
Bmr014_791	s	Others would consider it ; this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . ; You know ? ; Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .
Bed014_477	aa	is resolved later . ; Yeah . ; I think it has to be the the second case . ; Yeah .
Bed017_410	co	and we always give out the same answer , ; so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , ; and so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system . ; Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information
Bmr023_361	s	So I I think that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . ; Oh , yes . ; I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . ; But but , um for all sorts of reasons
Bmr005_1145	s	I mean there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . ; So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we we we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , ; and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , ; and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh , just picking uh features , which were uh will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,
Bmr016_1873	s	You need a lot of qualification Adam . ; That 's been changed . ; I guess so . ; So , exactly , that 's where the lengthening comment c came in .
Bmr028_583	b	It 's better than a ; But Yeah . But but the the chunks are already sh i in general , are short . ; So I I t I think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together , in order to have better language model ; Mmm .
Bsr001_744	bk	They won't be running on IRAM . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . ; OK .
Bmr015_373	aa	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; But they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers . ; Right .
Bmr010_1311	%	Um ; But , uh , ; a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_674	b	Right , I mean , ; so so one of our ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bed012_914	no	Like , when people do this kind of thing . ; Oh , when p How many constructions do people have ? ; Yeah . ; I have not the slightest idea .
Bro022_696	%--	um , ; but use the SRI system instead of HTK . ; That 's ; Yeah . That 's what I wanted , just , uh
Bed012_164	%--	I I I tend to agree . ; And if it 's If ; Well now , y I mean , you could ; And i if there 's sort of a clear winner here ,
Bmr015_325	b	It would be interesting ; So that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting ! ; It is . It is actually quite amazing . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1138	s	right ? ; When it starts . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah I know there is an I was looking on the we web page
Bed006_356	b	OK . ; OK . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro012_997	%--	and I think ; Yeah . ; I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem . ; So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but I think
Bro022_633	s	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's about the same , ; W w it was one one point two ; maybe a little worse .
Bed015_579	b	Add this structure to this space . " ; and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . ; An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , " what the space configuration is at the time of utterance " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_653	cc	I u Dan Gildea , GILDEA . ; And , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff , ; Who ? ; I can take you to his office .
Bmr006_1361	s	You know ? ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think
Bed013_53	s	On ? ; With us . ; Oh . ; And we sat around and we talked
Bro011_750	b	Yeah it 's it 's it 's free . ; I think we have it here r running somewhere . ; Great ! ; Yeah .
Bmr019_375	s	Alright . ; This way . ; There you go . ; If you have a strong fe if you have a strong preference , you could use this .
Bmr016_1036	g	Huh . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I 'm tr talking about Transcriber . ; Actually , you 're talking about Transcriber , right ?
Bro018_1096	s	Sorry , ; I take the current frame and the four past frames and the four future frames ; and that adds up to six seconds of speech . ; And I calculate um the spectral mean , of the log magnitude spectrum over that N .
Bns002_563	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; Uh - huh .
Bro005_1312	s	Well , OK . ; No , this is I think this is good . ; I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . ; You know , da training targets and noises and so forth .
Bmr019_1373	s	i it has ; Yeah . ; S That wouldn't work . ; No , it wouldn't work .
Bmr018_744	aa	I ; yeah , that was sort of a side issue . ; The issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels . ; I didn't think so either .
Bro019_746	aa	It 's it 's not guaranteed though . ; Yeah . ; Uh , it 's not guaranteed . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1719	s	So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue . ; Yeah . ; No , but there 's there 's a Gricean thing going on there , ; that when you say " I think " you 're actually hedging .
Bmr013_591	s	Interesting . ; as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . ; Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , uh , there the system doesn't work at all . ; So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something ,
Bro025_675	aa	The Half Dome was great . ; Good . ; Yeah . You didn't didn't fall . ; Well , yeah .
Bro018_1161	s	it 's a lot more training data . ; So ; So probably it should be something we should try then is to is to see if is at some point just to take i to transform the data ; and then and then uh use th use it for the SRI system .
Bmr022_377	%--	We could say " beep one " . ; And then they 'll hear the speech . ; I think having a beep too is good . ; So beep number .
Bed013_1455	bk	just so we can build a a language model for the recognizer . ; OK . ; But , um So those should be available soon . ; OK .
Buw001_814	b	we we might try that some ; and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , ; uh , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . ; Yeah .
Bro005_789	%	Yeah . ; And ; Uh . And the other the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is ; Mmm .
Bdb001_93	no	which has " start equals T - seventeen , ; end equals T - eighteen " . ; So what that 's saying is , we know it starts at this particular time . ; We don't know when it ends .
Bmr031_918	ba	Are they from one of the foreign - language ones ? ; Yep . ; I mean ; OK , good .
Bed005_894	b	um , this has been a a a Deep Map research issue that was is is part of the unresolved , and to - do 's , and something for the future , is how can we sort of run our our text , our content , through a machine that will enable us , later , to retrieve or answer e questions more sensibly ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bed016_616	s	No . ; But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading .
Bmr030_585	s	Or even a DVD burner . ; A DVD burner , yeah . ; I guess the real question is , where would we put it and who would do it ? ; I guess whoever records the meeting .
Bro003_606	b	There 's not much difference , really . ; And the ones that are gone , I think are I think there was they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop , ; which was basically a short period of silence , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_535	b	Yeah , but we 're just talking about something simple here , yeah , to see if ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1340	bk	Yeah . ; OK . ; So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how ; Yeah yeah , OK . Yeah .
Bmr022_1293	s	and if other people wanna Copy . ; In ; The Maybe the model ; It 's a little bit different in CVS .
Bmr027_1218	aa	Yeah . ; Oh , sure . Yeah . OK . ; Cuz I think sounds like people are interested . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2431	s	Right . ; I think it may almost have to do with like , " OK , ; I told a joke , ; now everyone 's laughing ,
Bmr011_731	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You don't you don't have to leave for it .
Bed005_1460	bd	I mean , they 're used to create tables ; so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML . ; Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is is to just convert it int into a into a C P T that you zip ; It 's blown up ,
Bmr011_739	b	Can I verbally consent ? ; I 'm wired in . ; We we we we don't , uh ; Yeah .
Bed011_1011	b	Eh - absolutely . ; Uh limited . ; I mean , you know , the idea is is , ; Yeah .
Bro016_176	s	as opposed to what 's coming from the language model . ; So that w ; Right . ; So , in effect , that 's changing the value of your insertion penalty .
Btr001_2069	b	Another possibility is pa partitions wouldn't work ; because then it would cut off the P Z Ms from having the indirect ; Right . ; Mmm .
Bro021_235	b	uh ; So would that be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time ; or ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1144	b	If it 's a large unit or a small unit , or ; Mm - hmm . ; we sh change the boundaries of the units , ; Right .
Bmr020_705	s	and also , um , the other person that wants it There is one person at SRI who wants to look at the um , you know , the uh the data we have so far , ; OK . ; and so I figured that FTP is the best approach . ; So what I did is I um @ @ I made a n new directory
Bmr002_291	s	Good . ; Cuz Morgan said he asked you . ; Oh , uh he did . ; and and I approved .
Bro021_628	%--	So you work with the complex numbers ; and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um , actually divide it out , ; um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting . ; So then ,
Bmr002_896	bk	Here 's another thing I got . ; Oh , so this 'd this w is probably what the L D C uses . ; I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D ; OK .
Bmr014_1016	aa	Yeah , but you 're wired ; aren't you ? ; Yeah . ; That is true .
Bro004_1166	s	well , it 's not isolated word , ; but but connected , ; you know , the the ; In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of .
Bmr008_1227	b	and if you 're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l uh s uh whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever , you could just grep for " role " and and you know , some some particular value . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it sounds like having the facility is great , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_577	s	Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere ; but we can't necessarily I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software ; but we may not ; in which case we 'll have to get them some other way ,
Bmr023_61	s	I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , ; but I thought there was a second thing . ; Anybody remember ? ; Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought ,
Bmr005_648	%--	Right . Right . ; I 'm expect I 'm not expecting ; Well ; Well , not only a word level , but actually
Bed015_1699	b	Yeah . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_479	aa	I haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain . ; Yeah , it 's it 's not defined yet . ; And um you are probably also involved in that , ; Um Yeah .
Btr002_3194	s	Oh . ; I 'm making a distinction . ; Oh . ; So you have the , um , comic " er " where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't wanna say that ,
Bmr022_50	aa	So this is ; For one meeting . ; this is one it 's one hour of of of speech ? ; Yep .
Bed011_1103	b	Mm - hmm . ; So the the " How do I get to X ? " , ; you know , that 's definitely gonna be uh , a major one . ; Yeah .
Btr001_103	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; Not a bad strategy .
Bed008_482	s	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; OK . ; That also points to entity type I guess .
Bro024_1067	g	Because it 's the CRC is computed for two frames always . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , that the they would need that forty milliseconds also . ; Right ?
Bro014_718	qw	And with the current weighting I think it 's sh it will be better ; because the well - matched case is better . ; Mmm . ; But how much worse since the weighting might change
Bmr030_604	br	Web - based ? ; Where you could send them audio files over the web ; and they send you back text files over the web . ; Really !
Bmr019_351	s	This is this that one 's better . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , but , you know , I uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem ,
Bro024_1266	b	Oh oh . ; Sorry . ; Uh , it 's Italian TI - digits . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1244	%--	So if you wanted to have a new type of action you 'd create a new type of category . ; Then this category would we would put it ; or not necessarily ; We would put a new action in the m uh in the categories that in which it has the
Bed014_120	s	Hiring somebody . ; We w um ; The guy . ; OK , so natural language generation produces not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech .
Bro017_93	s	And e and other people don't feel that , ; because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data , ; essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech , ; because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided .
Bmr012_903	s	So ; Is eight kilohertz is is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ? ; Yeah . ; And I have no idea what filter it 's using ,
Bmr020_1710	%--	sometimes the the the laptop is in the background ; and some somebody is is talking , ; and , that 's really a little bit confusing , ; but
Bro027_1304	b	Well , I I think that if you run it ; Actually , you maybe you remember this . ; When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_1096	b	Mm - hmm . ; when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . ; But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_142	b	or ? ; Uh , they they think it 's a terrific improvement . ; And , um , it real it just makes a a world of difference . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_429	co	well , I know , I shouldn't say that . ; That 's alright . ; No , the they they 're very weird . ; We need a wider sampling .
Bmr007_878	bk	I mean that when when you use , eh eh any ; I think he 's saying the onset detector . ; Yeah . ; Onset detector , OK .
Bro003_1885	b	Yeah . ; Automatically derived broad classes , or ? ; Yeah , I think so . ; Uh - huh .
Bns002_1218	s	eh gigahertz . S ; Uh , gigahertz . ; Yeah . ; In the RSM band .
Bmr018_1353	h	They seemed like a good group . ; What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ? ; Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings , ; Mmm , yeah .
Bro010_883	s	OK , ; Um , ; OK . ; um and he said there 's like twenty of these per per sub - band .
Bmr020_1191	t3	Jane ? ; Yeah ? ; In terms of the this new procedure you 're suggesting , um , u what is the ; It 's not that different .
Bed002_297	s	OK , good . ; Yeah . ; OK . It 's on . ; OK . That was the idea .
Btr002_3126	s	Yeah . ; B but y t finish your point . ; So , y ; Oh ! I was just I was just saying that , um , I I can I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced .
Bro016_122	bk	OK . ; So ; I can do that for next week . ; Yeah .
Bro011_742	x	I was going crazy trying to do that . ; Huh . ; Yeah . ; What is Octave so ?
Bro022_934	b	But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . ; I guess it depends on how you do it . ; But I mean , that 's that 's been a useful thing . ; Yeah .
Bro018_805	s	So we talked on the phone about this , that that there was still a difference of a of a few percent ; Yeah . ; Right . ; and you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done .
Bed014_1092	bk	Yeah . ; So that 's OK for you ; and do an on - line merging with my construal ideas . ; Sure , sure .
Bmr009_280	b	and the overlapping zone has eh less energy . ; Yeah . So there 'll be some cases for which ; Because there reach very many ; Right .
Bro024_252	bk	OK . ; Um ; And then you can yeah , you you can increase your window whi while you get while you are getting more samples . ; OK ,
Bro014_427	g	I I I think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; You know ,
Bmr022_608	aa	I think you do care about it . ; Because you have to know which ones match which . ; Unless you wanna know if they 're ; Right .
Bro025_453	bd	OK . ; You have , um ; So when you ; Uh , maybe I don't quite understand how this works ,
Bro028_976	s	and so it would be like a set of multi - scale features . ; So he 's interested in , um ; Th - this is because it 's , um there are these different parameters for the shape of these basis functions , um there are a lot of different possible basis functions . ; And so he he actually does an optimization procedure to choose an an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones .
Bmr005_1048	b	Well ; I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation , ; Since it 's the same people over and over . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_353	s	and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . ; So this is not something which we can actually monitor , now , ; but just is something we can set . ; And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out .
Bro011_428	%--	I don't know how complicated it is to go from there ; What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . ; And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it ; and it 's e but it
Bed010_699	bk	Right ? ; Yeah ; it 's or or just ; Yeah .
Bed004_786	s	Then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different ; Right . ; Could . Uh . ; Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore .
Bro014_1033	b	Um , we just ; How did we do it up again ? ; Uh , we distend the we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f filter , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_514	s	Edit - key . ; Did I show you guys that ? ; Yep . ; I did show it to you ,
Bmr002_1394	s	I mean they 've gotten away from w reel - to - reel tapes , ; Uh - huh . ; but ; and they do have DAT recorders ,
Bed009_397	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh , you know , take a bus " , ; whatever it is . ; So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff .
Bmr016_1805	s	Hmm . ; these changes have to be consistent with what 's in the Like spelling people 's names and so forth . ; If we make a spelling correction to their name , ; like someone had Deborah Tannen 's name mispelled ,
Btr001_1151	ar	Then you don't have to rush . ; Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ? ; Hnh - nn . ; No .
Buw001_437	s	y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , ; you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " . ; And , you know And and maybe you could get to it by that . ; If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it
Bed008_970	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we we , in no , in ; Mmm . ; Well , but the good thing is we we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love .
Bro012_953	%--	Yeah . ; Is it applied all the way back here ? ; It 's applied the ; um on ,
Bro027_1729	b	So that ; You could feed it into the neural net . ; The other thing you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1559	s	So this is this is gonna go on the meeting meeting transcriber bloopers tape , right ? ; Yes . ; Right . ; Well and part of it was funny , uh reason was because it was a mixed signal
Bed008_273	s	Well I eh ; No , I mean , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge ; and doesn't really matter which way you cross ; which where you end up at the end
Btr001_1638	s	I 'm ; Sometime I debate with myself whether it 's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's hard to decide sometimes .
Bmr006_1819	b	Yeah , a lot of these things are . ; Discourse . ; Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . ; Yeah , ab absolutely .
Bmr028_624	b	and it 's much better if we can keep those together , I think . ; Yeah . It 's , uh , funny looking at some of the transcripts . ; I was filtering by person , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1606	b	OK . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_88	s	oh . ; because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones . ; So . ; We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record .
Bmr016_1445	bk	No , no , I mean like the the " UH " , ; Article . ; " UH " . ; Oh .
Btr001_2381	ba	Wi ; Oh , OK . ; However , the context fits . ; I mean , that 's an interesting take on it . I think
Bro007_355	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and then we 'll operate with that ; and uh how long did it
Bed005_377	b	activate those h classes in the in the XML stuff ; But , um ; I saw those actions uh , the " Goodbye " stuff somewhere . ; Hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm , hmm .
Bro019_375	s	I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot , ; I just t g ; I just found that I have to reduce the value ; I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value .
Bed005_725	b	And you have both proper names and descriptions ; and y and you can ask for it . ; All those things . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_604	qw	I have to look at it again . ; Right . ; Yeah , but ; But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , um , say , an utterance and the words within it ?
Bsr001_998	%--	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , in many cultures it 's not bad manners to to speak on top of another one . ; Yeah , I was thinking , if Transcriber were invented in Italy or something , it would have been handling multiple
Bed003_181	b	Yep . ; Yeah , ; we meant , uh , touristic reasons . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1757	no	They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; falls apart . I don't know .
Bmr015_530	s	the session , ; uh uh , ; Yeah , well , your example was really ; information on the microphones ,
Bmr028_814	s	We don't have too many . We just have that just have a few Linux machin ; I mean , if you can't use all the processors on whatever machine , we 'll help you with that . ; Yeah . That 's right . ; Well , that 's the nice thing about it , is that i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special .
Bmr014_684	s	and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " . ; I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . ; And then they 'd hand it back to you . ; But certainly I wouldn't want a printout .
Bmr020_181	s	I mean , we didn't mention Morgan by name ; and he talks a lot . ; we just ; Well we have now ,
Bmr011_518	s	um ; So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . ; Huh . ; Um , so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .
Bro016_913	b	I think maybe we should , uh , try to integrate it in in our system . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_432	aa	I i ; Yeah , you don't have to ; you could keep them short by not s or just go one through ten , one through ten , one through ten , or one through twenty . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yep .
Bro025_500	b	because we still ? ; Yeah . I was wondering about that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_167	qy	Mm - hmm . ; And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component . ; Hmm . ; But do you really want to calculate the mean ?
Bmr002_1029	cc	Mm - hmm . ; but they uh they show up in resources . ; So , Um , we 'll start with " Transcriber " ; and if it looks like that 's not gonna do what we need , we 'll move on to the Mississippi State
Bed016_653	s	and my guess is that 's one of them , ; but , um I don't know . ; All contact . ; I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't social contact ,
Bmr010_783	b	My my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fan fantastic to ; Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_379	s	Great . ; I know this sounds weird , ; and maybe it 's completely stupid , ; but we don't have any overlapping digits .
Bmr027_960	s	Yeah . ; Well , that 's on my list . ; Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process . ; I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels .
Bro014_1433	b	uh , for for this purpose , that is . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1037	s	One , two , three ? ; Three 's too late . ; Two - thirty ? ; Oh , I i Yeah , I actually Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday .
Bed006_1717	g	so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say " well if you really look at it , you just need our RAD . " ; You can throw the rest away , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bmr029_212	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it 'd be really great if it was all automatic , but I think that , you know , given the pressure of time , if i i
Bmr003_672	aa	Oh , we have . ; I 'm sorry . ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bro024_152	s	On the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent . ; So so the they they it 's I don't mean to say that they 're they 're irrelevant . ; Uh , they are relevant . ; But , um , i for a demo , you won't see it .
Buw001_609	s	I I don't know how ; Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about . ; I don't know how , ; but for instance , I mean , the outline is sort of up here
Bdb001_1178	%--	the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated . ; And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version . ; OK ? ; Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on , uh well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know ,
Bmr015_1093	b	Oh , just to save the transcribers time . ; Well , I mean , you just have no idea . ; I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_796	b	Yeah . ; As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bmr005_1442	b	I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1997	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; So , um , ; that 's another thing that could be done
Bro028_137	bk	Could ? Uh , uh , ; I 'm I 'm really sorry . ; Can you repeat what you were saying about the silence probability ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_957	2	The destination . ; the neighbor . ; That Because this is the way eh eh more transmissions uh ; may take take place at the same time .
Buw001_1225	b	That was sort of what my question was aimed towards . ; So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen . Are we gonna later go over it ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bed002_765	s	So , to Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,
Bmr016_1691	ba	So I 'll just I was just looking at the bottom of page three there , ; is that " to be " or " not to be " . ; Yeah . ; Oh that 's cute .
Btr001_2028	s	I don't understand . " ; U no . ; Yeah , it 's difficult . ; Yeah , you guys talked about doing a videotape .
Bmr024_546	s	Because it 's two people and they 're not face to face . ; Wait a minute . ; Yeah . ; So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I I 'm uh , hadn't quite followed this process .
Bmr018_961	ba	So then they could just like put ; Oh that 's what you meant by just put an " X " there . ; and you 're consistent with th the automatic system , ; Uh , that 's an interesting idea .
Bmr025_464	bd	Um . ; Alright . ; That 's more seat information than we wanted . ; Never mind .
Bmr024_774	s	Yeah . ; Ah . ; OK . ; Well , I didn't realize that .
Bro017_742	qy	Yeah . ; But what I 'm proposing now , if it is important but not as important , you multiply it by point one in a model . ; But but but ; But what are you multiplying ?
Bmr005_82	s	but it 's something about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know , " John had washed the floor " or something like that . ; And I don't have it quite right , ; but that kind of thing , ; where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence ,
Bro005_389	b	The Spanish . ; Maybe for that . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bns001_533	s	Mountain View ? ; I I I I just uh take a a quick uh look at the at the thing ; because I I was uh read about this uh a long time ago . ; And it the the latest report I I found was in nineteen ninety eight .
Bro023_435	b	uh , eight point , uh , seven , ; and , uh , thirteen point seven . ; OK . ; Yep .
Bro024_536	bk	but ; this ; I 'm looking on the second page , ; Oh ,
Btr002_178	s	Oh , yeah . ; And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , the types of the types of confusions that happen , um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , the stress tends to be preserved ,
Btr002_1964	s	It was just really bizarre . ; So . ; That 's really funny . ; Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that .
Bro024_879	aa	I mean , we we could trit uh , we we could think how w what what we could try . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it was just an idea . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro014_846	b	but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation . ; No . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah ,
Bmr011_148	s	And this one isn't very adjustable , ; so this about as good as I can get ; Yeah . ; cuz it 's a fixed boom .
Bed009_642	s	I ; Yeah . ; and it cant sort of formulate its what it wants in a in a rather a abstract uh way , ; you know f " Find me a good route for this . "
Btr002_2523	qw	I think it 's more emphatic . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; W what about pre transcribing it , um , " HMPH " ?
Bmr028_1254	s	Right . ; So ; Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ? ; I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that .
Bro004_417	ar	but but , um , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? ; I mean no no mixture but just ; I 'll get it for you . ; Uh , no , no .
Bro004_400	s	the other thing I was asking him , though , is that I think that in the case ; Yeah , ; you you do have to be careful ; because of com compounded results .
Buw001_1906	bk	Landay or Jason ? ; Landay . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr009_1621	bk	So . Um . I mean I had to leave at three thirty , ; so I can Well , I can wait for the digits but I can't stay for the discussion ; Uh - oh . ; Oh .
Btr002_177	b	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , the types of the types of confusions that happen , um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1081	aa	Oh good . ; It just sends me ; So you haven't made it so much fun . ; Right .
Bmr014_817	s	well we ; Well , I don't think I ; there was this ; well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues .
Bro024_1951	t3	I can send ; yet . ; Would you pass those down ? ; Oh !
Bro004_377	s	because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , ; at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , ; Mm - hmm . ; but you have the same number of parameters representing it .
Btr001_471	b	You kno ; it was i j I just think that , um , her fluency in English wasn't wa um , wasn't very very high up there , ; so it was really difficult . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1463	s	Definitely . ; And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in , they 'll check it out once , ; Yep . ; they 'll make all the changes ,
Bmr008_1778	no	I I I don't know ; so it 's ; Yep . ; I don't know
Bed016_797	s	Yeah . Yeah . ; right ? ; so if the film left , ; you know state is being near film .
Bmr031_1231	b	I did my tour of the heartland . ; Right . Yeah . ; Did you build any houses ? ; Yeah .
Bed013_234	bk	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . Yeah , that 's big . ; Cuz you have to query the node , for every a uh , or query the net two to the twenty times . ; Sure .
Bns002_838	s	Yeah , ; sure , sure . ; for whatever control , or whatever kind of things , you know . ; In fact in fact , you know I I I I I maybe I I I had to to prepare a more detailed eh , view ,
Btr001_2379	bk	now what I 'm thinking ; I didn't have the extra the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the " uh " , which you just which you just did . ; Wi ; Oh , OK .
Bmr024_260	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they 're really excellent .
Bed005_439	%	Now , if we know that " Write " produces a " Feature Discourse - Status Confirm Discourse - Status " . ; So if I now say " Write , Goodbye , " it should do that . ; It sho it creates this , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_829	ar	Mmm . No , ; they are not ; No . ; no .
Bmr026_298	s	So . Uh , ; no , we 're talking about on the computer ; Right . ; and and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,
Bed015_2200	%--	Fine with me . ; Should we do the one PM time ; for Thursday since we were on that before ; or ?
Bmr003_900	%--	Yeah . ; And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time . ; Right . ; Well , uh but there 's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate
Bmr012_803	bk	so I was just ; and , you know , what ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1903	bk	What time is it ? ; Uh , why don't we do it together , ; Uh , quarter to four . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr021_758	aa	Doesn't matter ? ; No , just would be a sign change . ; Except you get a lot of negatives the other way . ; Right , right , right .
Bed014_723	%--	Oh , I see . ; since you had to recognize it anyway . ; That that 's the argument in the other direction . ; at at
Bro011_551	s	Yes , I 'm playing . ; Um so I wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task ; and see how that affects things . ; And so I had this um I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment ,
Bmr022_1158	b	But it it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file . ; You know , it 's it 's , um . ; Well , so , you don't have to release it to the world until you 're ready to . ; Yeah .
Bro003_549	bk	Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six . ; Sixty - one . ; Oh , OK . ; I see .
Bmr019_207	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording TI - digits . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .
Bmr005_1307	s	You could do this , ; Well yeah , ; you know . You could . ; or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um have them do the digits , or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .
Bed015_752	b	Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't . ; Um , so my classic my now - classic example of saying , " Oh , he did go to the meeting ? " , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1172	s	and then you have one or more access points . ; These access points are uh in fact providing the eh required connectivity from the mobiles to the network to the m wired network , ; and from there to the internet usually . ; Yeah , in principle , the base station .
Bmr021_96	ba	Because it it pinches pinches the temples too much . ; Oh . ; Oh . ; I mean , so , if you wear it sort of around the back , it 's not too bad .
Bmr016_1275	s	A comment , basically . ; Oh , oh , oh . ; And then the no non - vocalization would be something like a door - slam . ; They always end .
Bro004_765	b	you 're ignoring ; you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , ; you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1311	%--	" that 's the right direction . ; We will support that . " ; And if Siemens say " OK , great , we will support it " , ; and and what it
Bmr031_1176	bk	I 'll I 'll take that role anytime you want . ; I like saying it . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr022_672	s	Yep . ; You know , like ; I think it would save them time . ; We have to ask them .
Bns002_1560	b	which are working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff , ; so that the UCB is clustered as one uh partner ; but nevertheless with different departments . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm .
Bmr029_188	%--	because th then we could claim that everything 's automatic . ; Do you know when he 'll have the the comparison ? ; Right . ; Well , I 'm as I said , I just started the recognizer , um
Bmr011_1033	s	Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , ; especially forced alignment . ; So , ; uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed
Bmr021_2	s	 ; If you 're popular . ; One two three four five six I 'm on seven . ; We 're on .
Bro003_1847	bk	they have German , ; they have all all sorts of languages , um , mapping mapping to the SAMPA phonemes , ; which ; Yeah ,
Bmr007_399	s	Yeah . ; even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn . ; Yeah ? ; So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's We know that that 's wrong in real time .
Bro014_409	%--	No . ; That 's a that 's a that 's an arg ; I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing . ; that 's an ar
Bmr029_319	b	Right . Right . So that 's why I 'm saying I 'm not sure how they would scale with more machines . ; well ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_970	%--	Yeah , that seems like a good thing to do , probably , ; not uh again a short - term sort of thing . ; Yeah . ; I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's
Bmr031_495	b	um , I mean , ; it 's @ @ sixty kilohertz is plenty . ; Yep . That 's wh that 's what I thought . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_339	aa	um , It 's not illegal or anything ; right , ; it 's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal , whatever , to ask for their age , ; No , not at all ,
Bed010_26	s	Um , the uh ; Oh , ; Am Spartacus . " ; " I am Sm - I am Smarticus " is what it 's saying .
Bmr022_556	%--	I mean if in terms of the alignment , actually , all we would need is we wouldn't even need words . ; We would need a general speech model and a beep model . ; Cuz all we 're really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps . ; Well , the for the forced alignment will run fa
Bed008_1360	ar	one full quarter times point one ; Not one quarter , ; so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . ; No .
Buw001_1822	s	I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up . ; My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it ; Mmm . ; He would never use it .
Buw001_1711	b	So . ; It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . ; But w ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_849	s	so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s uh , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , ; and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . ; And , um , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . ; But they 're they 're generally very good .
Bed008_1521	b	OK . ; Yeah yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr023_90	ba	So . ; We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record . ; So . ; That 's cool .
Btr002_2421	b	I don't think I 've ever heard it . ; No . ; No . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_1277	bk	um , ; I mean , y you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards . ; But the the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection , um , is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to a computer in the machine in in the room . ; Right .
Bmr021_173	s	Yeah . ; Is that more or less than you thought ? ; It depends on how good the mike is . ; Oh that 's way more than I thought .
Bro025_327	s	because the LDA doesn't have any delay . ; So if we re if we reduce the delay of the VAD , I mean , it 's like effectively reducing the delay . ; How how much , uh , delay was there on the LDA ? ; So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay .
Bmr005_584	2	Um , Are you making any use ; uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . ; Does it uh ; With By Jane .
Bmr002_623	s	So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you guys are more expert on that , I mean , than I am , ; but I want to say that I know for a fact , I keep running across these ,
Bns002_1356	s	You know this something , uh I 'm putting on the table ; I 'm not sure about , uh if this can be really of interest or not ; but , it 's an idea , ; and I 'll be happy to discuss it with you .
Bmr014_1119	%--	Yeah . ; And ; And so I don't think they need another signature . ; Well and furthermore I
Bmr026_84	cc	um , I guess since she 's ; I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I maybe I 'll ; Yeah , well it certainly seems ; Uh if if that 's OK with you to to , you know , get that stuff uh to ask her for that , then I 'll do that .
Bmr023_473	s	cuz I have some some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in , ; but so far , um , as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . ; And , um ; Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six .
Bmr014_421	s	Absolutely . ; I agree . ; That 's a very good that 's a very good uh , suggestion . ; And that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed .
Bmr016_732	b	So it would just be ver ; that 's really the next step ; because we can't do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2122	aa	Yeah , sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr006_353	b	Yep . ; I mean , we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and ; Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that ; Yeah .
Bmr009_571	s	So . It 's mostly that , if we had to label it ourselves , we we would or we 'd have to , to get started , ; but if It it would be much better if you can do it . ; You 'd be much better at doing it also ; because you know , I I 'm not I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out ,
Bmr010_486	b	And and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mikes . ; Yeah . ; So , ; OK .
Bmr002_590	b	They 're designed for um for phoneme - level ; Yeah . ; Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1144	s	So is it maybe a research topic to focus on the ; not really billing , of course . ; I wouldn't ; but at least the different application of protocol - based usage .
Bmr022_92	qw	Um ; Can I I I just ; And they just filled it in . ; How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ?
Bsr001_2073	%--	Yeah . ; So " gonna " versus " going to " and that kind of thing . ; Right . ; I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we
Bed006_1418	g	Mm - hmm . ; Because if we know that Enter is a t is an SPG action , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bro024_370	bk	But in in the case of the mobile , uh , presumably the acoustic 's changing all over the place . ; Right . ; And in that case you probably don't wanna have it be endless because you wanna have some sort of it 's it 's not a question of how long do you think it 's you can get an approximation to a stationary something , given that it 's not really stationary . ; Right .
Bro024_1459	fa	Um , ; Uh - huh . ; mm - hmm . ; I 'm sorry .
Bro016_117	bk	OK . ; So . ; I I would ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1377	%--	Uh ; I mean , if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area ; We prune very conservatively . ; I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um we could probably tighten the pruning without really
Bmr009_320	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps , ; like but by hand ,
Bmr022_1400	b	I just I don't s ; And if they really do it a lot , and they say " we 're a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcripts " then we can face that if it happens , ; I don't see that this is e ; Yep .
Bro003_982	bk	we 're we 're gonna be , um , training on the noise files that we do have . ; So , ; um ; Yeah ,
Bro019_608	aa	So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something ; Right . ; and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1456	s	Uh - huh . ; So and , um , ; Mats Gould . ; And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart .
Bsr001_2416	bk	Funny . ; Hmm . ; That 's a good idea . ; Oh .
Bmr012_793	%--	I mean it 's not i it wouldn't be a problem if you 're interested in it ; We could try that . ; it would ; Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know
Bmr019_1759	aa	Yeah . It is . ; I think a year is a lot better . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_429	b	So all of a sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there . ; Right . ; And people talking about pictures and pictorial representations ; Hmm .
Bed002_1215	b	So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot , ; and ; Right . Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_72	s	but I even think that , um ; I mean , once Once you have this sort of as running as a module ; Right ? ; What you want is You wanna say , " OK , give me the posterior probabilities of the Go - there node , when this is happening . "
Bro027_150	b	But , um ; but it 's still pretty noisy . ; Even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_797	co	Oh it 's the same . ; Oh no no . ; Is is new Is OK . ; So don't fill these out .
Bmr018_1337	s	But it sounded like they were pretty well thought out ; Yeah , th that 's true . ; and they 're they 're gonna be real meetings , ; it 's just that they 're with str with people who would not be meeting otherwise .
Bmr026_1073	s	Sort of given up guessing . ; But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? ; Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got ; Uh well . It depended on the task .
Bmr009_1284	bd	because it is easier to have it open ended . ; we might learn from what they say , as to which one 's a better way to ask it . ; But I Cuz I really don't know . ; W This is just a small thing
Btr001_773	s	That 's kind of interesting . ; Usually it 's not ; usually that doesn't happen ; but this time it did .
Bro017_478	aa	Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline . ; Using your uh voice activity detector ? ; u Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr021_739	t1	I mean , what the bandwidth is . ; Um , ; but the results are such that ; uh , let 's see
Btr002_1940	s	and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else ; and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before . ; And and what he had done , is he had left the room to g ; He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him .
Btr002_781	s	Yeah . ; It 's very good . ; Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though , ; and so sometimes you have to , um , try to listen
Btr002_86	ba	Now that changes the meaning . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; It 's interesting .
Bro008_561	aa	Where where 's the meeting ? ; Uh , Amsterdam , I think , ; Yeah , Amsterdam . ; yeah ?
Bmr015_94	b	Oh ! By throw them out completely ? ; Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . ; So those are those are the two options . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_364	s	So . ; Which means that actually the weight on the well - matched is ; Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference ; because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also .
Btr002_1956	s	and what the heck 's he talking about ? ; Wow ! ; But just sort of just weird things like that , ; and , um Yeah , he had just left the room
Btr002_3318	b	It was used in place of , uh , something that was in unintelligible . ; OK . ; To fill in . I see . ; Mmm .
Bed003_107	s	because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode , ; right , ; there 's gotta be a reason for it . ; And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls .
Bed003_1682	%--	But it 's a , um , simple solution . ; We can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this , ; but maybe not today . ; The other thing um I will
Bro024_1651	s	I mean , you you have now several stages of smoothing , so to say . ; You start up . ; As far as I remember you you smooth somehow the envelope , ; you smooth somehow the noise estimate ,
Bed009_833	s	and it 's uh ; I I can give you the names of the people who do it there . ; But um . ; Then there is of course more ways of parsing things .
Bro014_155	b	So , ; um , ; uh , I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1647	b	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Because I mean , it should have a similar effect if you ; Yeah .
Btr001_1679	aa	so . And you know , the the segmenter usually misses little things like " mm - hmm " and " yeah " ; Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right . ; and ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bed004_381	s	Now . ; Alright , so I understand what 's what you got . ; I don't yet understand how you would use it . ; So let me see if I can ask
Bed006_735	b	Or ; No . ; We This is the output , sort of , of the natural language understanding , ; Oh , yeah .
Bed004_285	b	maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it , ; uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , ; but in any case , ; Yep .
Bmr019_1468	%	So I think that 's that 's an interesting question . ; If we 're getting three percent error on , uh , u uh , English , uh , nati native speakers , um , using the Aurora system , and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two , do those same improvements bring , uh , th you know , the SRI system from one point three to you know , to point eight ? ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_347	b	Well , you know , the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases , um , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use , none of this would be good enough . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_321	s	Mmm , oh , OK . ; Oh OK . ; But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits , ; whether it 's these digits or TI - digits , to speakers , um , and compare that to their spontaneous speech ,
Bed006_1757	bk	but if you if you if you work in th in that XML community it is a great acronym ; Like ; because it e evokes whatever RDF ; Oh .
Btr002_923	s	Right . ; it 's that mountain right there , I can tell , then ; Yeah . ; Right , then I 'll drag it .
Bsr001_918	b	Hmm ? ; right ? ; Right . ; Right .
Bns001_183	bk	That makes work . ; No , ; but this is oh , uh Everybody 's obliged to do it for his own , you know . ; Yeah .
Bed003_932	%--	Oh . ; Oh wait , ; it might be ; Did we w
Btr001_868	%--	And ; Yeah . ; Uh there 's ; it 's it 's funny how , um ,
Bmr016_1638	%--	Yes . ; Y no normally you don't go around saying , " Now you 've said it six times . ; Yeah that 's right . ; Now you 've said "
Bed015_489	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Same thing . ; So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? ; And then I think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y
Btr001_1325	bk	Yeah , and we had to split them up . ; See , I never got one of those . ; Yeah , and you have to parse them all down . ; Right ,
Bmr011_1697	b	Padded cell . ; It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the ; There was a dorm room at Tech that , uh , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , uh , the floor with mattresses . ; Mmm .
Bmr010_129	b	And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . ; And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1863	%--	tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits ; and , ; OK . ; Uh ,
Bmr011_1414	s	A lot of it can be done ; Great . So a a lot of this kind of ; Yeah . ; I think there 's a second pass
Bro024_1098	aa	so we should probably try to move along . ; Uh , did you wanna go next , Stephane ? ; I can go next . ; Yeah .
Bed006_30	fa	OK . ; Some in some introductions are in order . ; Oh , OK ; sorry .
Bmr031_1015	s	I mean , people could , like , backchannel ; and ask questions and stuff . ; Yeah . ; I 'll I 'll I 'll keep saying " uh - huh " . Yeah .
Bmr011_985	qw	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? ; Why not just do it all ourselves ?
Bro022_891	s	Hmm . ; So , yeah . ; It it might be that what I did is ; so , removes like low , um , uh low - energy , uh , speech frames .
Bro014_1566	s	And I found some some , uh , neat papers , um , historical papers from , um , Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai . ; Yeah . ; And they they did a lot of experiments where th where , um , they take speech and , um , e they modify the , uh ; they they they measure the relative importance of having different , um , portions of the modulation spectrum intact .
Bmr022_434	b	you could keep them short by not s or just go one through ten , one through ten , one through ten , or one through twenty . ; Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . ; And then also , if we I mean , I don't know what their setup is , but your template idea might be a way of of of ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_301	s	But that was mostly for reference purposes , ; just to refer to the meaning pole . ; I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , ; which is really what we want most of the time I think .
Bro012_1295	s	R Right . So you have a second neural net . ; It could be pretty small . ; Yeah . If you have a tandem system ; and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net
Bro026_184	aa	This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . ; I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1880	s	it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . ; Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n ; Mmm . ; don't try to do them in detail or formally
Bmr031_893	b	Yeah . That 's approval in progress . ; Mm - hmm . ; Everything on the ; Yeah .
Bro012_1058	qo	That that ; uh ; So um . ; This there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? "
Bed004_243	ba	and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better . ; Oh , yeah , ; and then of course as she does it she 'll she 'll learn @ @ . ; So that 's great .
Bed015_2173	aa	But you yeah , it 's a good it 's a it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal . ; What 's it ? ; So are you gonna write something for us before you go ? ; Yes .
Bro027_1656	b	Oh , I just I just h put the second stream in place and , uh ran one experiment , ; Uh . ; but just like just to know that everything is fine . ; Uh - huh .
Bed005_389	br	Well , we 'll find that out . ; So whatever n this does ; I mean this is , basically , looks l to me like a function call , right ? ; Hmm ?
Bro019_1485	ft	You know , if you 're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay , you could stay with me for a while . ; I 've got a spare bedroom right now . ; Oh . OK . ; Thanks .
Bro011_95	%--	Um . We started to work with this . ; Hmm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; And the third point um was the um ,
Bro018_363	bk	So they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two . ; I don't know . ; Yeah , I ; um Right .
Bro017_1005	%--	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; That could be set up fairly easily I think , ; and you have a whole bunch of
Bmr009_1549	s	Yeah . ; So . ; We we could do that but that would mean changing the code . ; I mean this isn't a program we wrote .
Bed017_476	%--	So it seems like a lot of some of the issues are the same . ; It 's like , um , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; um , s how to interpret .
Btr001_2035	bk	sort of ; First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , ; that it would be worthwhile doing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_177	b	So so don't uh don't do the division , ; but let the net have everything . ; That 's another thing you could do ; yeah .
Bed009_625	ar	Yes I was just that 's my next question ; hmm ; whether we 're we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not . ; No .
Bro026_667	s	Yeah . ; Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , ; right ? ; It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that .
Bmr027_1004	co	There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five .
Bmr027_1211	b	You just b go and b ; Oh . ; Yeah . They always have them in stock . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1351	qw	Um . ; I just don't see why you would ; I mean does th ; Who uses this uh this data structure ?
Bmr027_986	s	There 's another issue which is this ; we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um ; We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings ; and they 're downloading the audio files .
Bed008_795	s	and then everything would be clean . ; You could do it again . ; Why , I think it 's worth saving this one ; but I think I 'd I 'd like to keep this one
Bro007_552	b	Yeah ? ; Oh , that was good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_330	b	And , um , in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there . ; Our belief - net thinks he wants to go there , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr002_771	%--	What they 're doing is trying to bring together ; and they rate things . ; I wasn't focused on that ; so I didn't
Bmr020_1064	s	but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap . ; OK . ; Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as . ; You know , Wally Chafe says that um , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , uh , that the the what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds .
Bed012_436	s	And not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local , ; because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities . ; Yeah . ; What what we need is a just a mechanism that says , " Aha ! There is "
Bro005_1393	s	You 're happy . ; OK everyone should be happy . ; OK . ; You don't have to be happy .
Bed006_138	s	M m Majors ? ; Ma - majors , majors . ; Majors ? ; OK , mayor
Bmr011_1027	%--	So so first of all you ; um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge . ; Um , but second of all , uh in general because some of these channels , ; I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are
Bmr020_1357	s	Mm - hmm . ; How interesting ! ; Yeah . ; I mean it wouldn't be that much fun for a transcriber to sit there , hear it , beep , yes or no .
Bns002_1445	s	Nevertheless , I discussed , with a lot of partners , these things . ; And today , uh Michael and me , we were on the UCB to discuss with a guy who is a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff . ; They are going in that direction . ; They have a small project funded by NSA
Bmr029_611	aa	What what can I do to ? ; Y y you said it would be easy for you to do that top one there , ; and I guess Don can do the segmentations of the , uh , channel F ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_151	s	Oh , OK . ; No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency , ; e e just simply fluency . ; I mean , I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates um in computer science uh , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .
Bed005_654	bk	Then then , ; yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ? ; Uh , this and this , of course , was just the action end . ; OK .
Bdb001_1123	s	I 'm not sure what that @ @ ; Well , I mean , is that ; Well , we don't have to go into the codes . ; It probably doesn't matter .
Bmr028_1376	b	Yeah , it 's f only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling , ; Yeah . In pattern recognition , or in ; I think . It 's really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception , ; Yeah .
Bns001_1141	%--	UMTS or wireless u i generally are will be m more expensive . ; And especially UMTS . ; If they want to get back the money . ; So is it maybe a research topic to focus on the
Bmr007_281	%--	in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute . ; No , but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two . ; OK . ; In that case , um my c the coding that I was using since we haven't , uh incorporated Adam 's , uh coding of overlap yets , the coding of
Bmr024_332	aa	No , they make mistakes . ; Right . ; But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits . ; Right .
Bdb001_668	b	they 're actually overlapping each other , sort of . ; So ; the thing is that some something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose . ; Right .
Buw001_380	s	So he 's just sort of going " where where do I where do I start ? " ; w ; Well , th you could do ; I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,
Bmr016_624	s	cuz ; Yeah . ; And someone said " oh " in the front in the middle . ; and oh and someone said " oh , " the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ?
Bro014_803	%--	but ; OK . ; There was a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something . ; Is that ?
Btr001_1615	s	So , I guess I don't see too much of a difference ; but that 's just because it 's me . ; Mm - hmm . ; Like I think I like checking more for that reason
Bmr021_73	s	Cuz ; I don't know , ; but you know , in in sort of random polling ; L Liz Liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them .
Bns001_1183	s	Yeah . ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Not just the islands alone .
Btr002_342	qh	Yeah . That 's true . ; Right . Mm - hmm . ; Well , I would hope they would have native speaker transcribers transcribing . ; Ideally , wouldn't that be something .
Bro024_1866	b	No , I I my result is with the noisy noisy LDA . ; It 's with the noisy one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns003_660	b	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; But I 'm working on it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2405	s	W we don't need X access ; In in theory . ; but I mean that 's fine . ; That 's that 's what it does ,
Bmr019_1269	s	and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time , ; and then look where they are relative to each other , ; and that 's not really what I heard . ; And that 's another thing she said .
Bns001_1161	s	So . ; And then you are still at the triple - A service uh activity ; Yeah , that 's right . ; and nobody is has the skills to deal with that .
Btr002_2697	b	And it 's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well . ; Yeah . ; Because it 's sort of expulsive and and , uh , that kind of thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_351	qw	Yeah , the Go - there , the Info - on , and the Location ? ; Well , d yeah , this is making the assumption . ; Yes . ; What do you mean by " differently weighted " ?
Bed006_949	bk	That 's ; Or estimated . ; but it 's soon . ; OK , OK .
Bns001_728	s	For inf ; not not at the ; of course , you know , I 'm I I agree with you that there are a lot o of things to be developed ; but But the point is that uh this is probably not here .
Bro022_1127	b	And , one of the things that last week , ; eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff ; because the signal have different level of energy . ; Hmm ?
Bmr010_130	%--	And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I did some training on on one dialogue , which was transcribed by
Bed015_1396	b	I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff ; Hmm . ; There 's almost I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . ; Yeah .
Bro014_561	aa	mmm , ; you need more features . ; So you really need to put more more in the in in the front - end . ; Yeah .
Bed006_266	s	And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that " ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here " ; and " I wanted to maybe take a picture of that " ; and " maybe um eat here " ; and then goes in and solves the task with the system ,
Bmr023_943	s	I don't know if Dan fixed it or or , uh , what he ; Well , he made it a parameter . ; He made it a parameter . ; So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it
Bed012_201	s	And for the Where - Is construction , we know we need to l look at this node , that merges these three things together ; Mm - hmm . ; as for th to decide the response . ; And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes .
Bmr005_374	%--	With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech speech what eh different duration . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sure . ; Does this ?
Bmr031_939	s	Didn't you wanna say something about the hardware set - up ? ; Oh , that 's right . ; Uh . ; Yeah , we have new hardware .
Bed014_824	s	No . ; Uh . ; Anyhow . ; Well , I 'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it 's Robert 's .
Bmr031_401	s	CD . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , forty - four point one .
Bro027_1661	b	Yeah . ; And and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , ; which is like zero improvement . ; Yeah .
Btr001_575	ba	No . ; No , it was one like one ribbon for everybody ; No . ; Oh , wow .
Bmr009_1393	s	definitely under " Other " . ; Well , you know , Pennsylvania has a pretty strong dialect and it 's totally different than ; Pennsylvania ; Yeah . Pennsylvania is not New England .
Bsr001_290	co	And you just have to bring it up . ; but at that point at that point it wouldn't be much different to to wear this or that . ; Yeah , ; go to that .
Bro024_1352	2	So di ; Yeah . ; So the alignments might be wrong then on channel one , right ? ; On one .
Btr001_2130	h	let 's see . ; I had something that I could bring up . ; Yes . ; Um ,
Btr001_2547	ar	Yeah , ; and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on , ; and he said , " Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so " ; and then she said , " Well , no ,
Bro025_487	bk	I see . ; So . Yeah , that 's what that 's what that 's what , uh , this is doing right now . ; I see . ; OK .
Bro017_1282	b	Hmm . ; And uh in otherwise the Intel libraries , I think they are available free of f freely . ; But they may be running only on on uh on uh Windows . ; Yeah .
Bro014_850	s	yeah . ; Um ; Yeah . ; We have here some histogram ,
Bmr005_1367	s	Nope . ; Yeah , but You know , so they they they have you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do , ; What if ; Yeah , you we can't complain .
Bmr020_1649	b	Oh yeah , ; I pr I much prefer this , ; I was just trying to find a way ; Yeah .
Bro027_1552	s	I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? ; So you were just trying ; I think you r ; I mean , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect
Bmr012_842	b	Just Mm - hmm . ; No the reason I say this ; PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_500	bk	well , so five PM their time is is ; Not five PM , three PM . ; if ; three PM .
Bed003_400	s	Right . ; So let 's see . ; The variables . ; Disc - " admission fee " is a binary thing ,
Bmr001_6	co	We 're somewhere in between . ; OK , so that 's ; OK , so we have some sheets for uh some standard doohickies to ; Wait .
Bns001_863	s	Especially at uh Georgia Tech . ; I know on next week on Tuesday . ; Tuesday , right ? ; We will go to UCB .
Bro018_1021	ba	Oh ! ; He he He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli ; Yeah . ; Oh well that 's That 's a pretty good point right there .
Bro017_658	s	so we were coming with all these f various lifters . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh Bell Labs had he this uh uh r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody , ; but but uh we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters .
Bed014_767	s	Well , let 's let 's talk after Friday the twenty - ninth . ; Then we 'll see how f f ; Right . So h he 's got a th he 's got a meet meeting in Germany with his thesis advisor . ; Yeah , he said he 's gonna f finish his thesis by then .
Bmr006_733	b	Eh , I I mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , ; Mm - hmm . ; eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_186	%--	OK . Mmm - mmm . ; Oh ! OK , sorry , ; go on . ; And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or
Buw001_1321	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . ; So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now ; You weren't interested
Btr002_2100	aa	Oh , really ? ; It was I didn't mean for to be doing it . ; Oh , OK . ; No , yeah . N Yeah .
Bro013_404	b	Right . ; I think it 's sixty - five . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_209	s	In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . ; And you do this gross thing saying " Well I guess it 's this phone starting there " . ; So , uh , that 's the reasoning . ; But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much .
Btr002_1596	aa	and ; Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr020_1476	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; things like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_251	co	um and uh also these different normalizations , does a particular choice of normalization make it better ? ; But I had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots ; because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions . ; Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature .
Bmr006_45	bk	And he 's already funded part - time , ; so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , ; What a deal . ; uh Yeah .
Bed006_1725	s	But then again um in this case , the domain object may contain information that we don't really care about either . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; H But w we 'll see that then , and how how it sort of evolves .
Bmr026_548	b	I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around ; and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks ; and and you know recover the space . ; Yep .
Bro019_355	b	So , ; just just the LDA filters . ; I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1176	s	And you know , " container " that you can go in and out . ; All of these things . ; And so , um , ; I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day
Bmr016_1155	s	However , things like " cuz " where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , ; and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , ; those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate , ; and used the convention of using " CUZ " for that form ,
Bmr022_272	ba	you know , if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again , they know it 's the same beep . ; Versus if they heard a slightly different one . ; Yeah . ; Hmm , interesting .
Bed006_1565	aa	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; two thirty - ish or three is ; Yeah .
Bns002_1268	%--	let 's say , for communicating inside a building , inside a a small office . ; So , uh some people , I think , is being tempted to think that Bluetooth could provide them uh , some kind of local connectivity , ; but uh for for data for computing uses . ; Eh , however , I think that the that the When you have tried uh current eh standard eh working devices , you you
Bro005_53	no	well , it 's still not completely filled , ; but we have more results to compare with network using without PLP ; and finally , hhh , um ehhh PL - uh delta seems very important . ; Uh I don't know .
Btr002_3024	aa	And so , I 'm glad you said that ; because , um , that actually takes a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration to d to do that . ; A lot of time . ; Yeah .
Bed015_437	bk	Oh , yeah , I forgot . ; Oops . Sorry . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro005_1011	qo	maybe not just the best one , ; but the best few or something ; You want the most promising group from these other experiments . ; Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ?
Bns001_267	s	and go to the outer world with , and and and align it in a certain way . ; For instance , that it also fit , maybe , to KPN , and Siemens , and in other companies . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and This probably has to be a brainstorm right now .
Bed002_956	ba	uh ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; n No one is , at the moment .
Bro019_190	s	Um , ; I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop , ; I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines ; and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out .
Bro016_1063	s	OK . ; Um . ; Yeah . I think the ; just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event .
Bro027_1973	bk	you 're not gonna be around this afternoon ? ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; Oh , well .
Bmr022_125	b	Yeah . ; I 'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour . ; Can he send them I guess he could send them multiple tapes ; Oh !
Bmr005_307	s	Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . ; That makes sense , yeah . ; Um ; And the downsampling must have been Dan .
Bro016_987	aa	Yeah . ; Huh . ; Canada w Canada wants a cut ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_770	b	Now if it could all be pre - marked at some , l you know , good ; ar but ; Are are those d delays adjustable ? ; Hmm .
Bmr012_1102	s	Uh y right ; Without getting more stuff . ; cuz ; so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen
Bro019_903	b	which could take it further . ; What was your point about about colored noise there ? ; Oh , the colored noise ; Yeah .
Bro004_516	s	Right . ; So w w So , I 'm sorry . I missed that . ; What 's MF , MS and ME ? ; Multi - French ,
Bed003_501	b	Yeah . ; OK , I see your point . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1028	s	But , you know , the fact that they noticed , you know , the " nnn " . " He said " nnn " , not " and " . ; What shall I do with that ? " ; I mean , they 're very perceptive . ; And and s several of them are trained in IPA .
Bed016_191	s	There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . ; readability ; Hmm ? ; There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . On page five .
Bmr028_1723	b	you know . ; I guess the troub trouble in my mind is that it that it 's not a very neat corpus ; if you say " these data are available , ; Yeah .
Bro004_1081	s	And um , it ap it ap ; Oh what does what does ASP ? ; Oh that 's ; The features ,
Bmr013_194	cc	after coffee , you 're right . ; Not after lunch . ; OK , so , um , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . ; And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .
Bmr005_333	b	eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , ; eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech ; Nonspeech sounds ? ; Yeah .
Bro016_233	s	So . ; Right . ; Mmm . ; I 'll bet you there 's still a lot of insertions .
Bmr014_1041	s	Tha - that 's true . ; That 's more severe , but the next one says the transcript will be around . ; that 's right . ; And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you ,
Bmr027_989	s	and they 're downloading the audio files . ; So they 'll be doing that . ; Chuck 's Chuck 's , uh , put that in . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the web
Bed002_761	s	I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , ; Mm - hmm . ; um , that that will help us along those lines . ; But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model .
Bro010_568	s	so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . ; And then you look over the whole thing ; and now you have a noise spectrum . ; So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method .
Bmr028_1776	b	Yeah . So you 'll have si ; So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh , simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks . ; A simultaneous digit . OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_535	s	OK . ; I 'm trying to finish up some stuff . ; Yeah sure . I 'd like to ; So just update all the naming conventions
Bsr001_499	b	and I get a little bit of peripheral vision , ; but other than that , it 's not bad at all . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro022_462	%--	And they and ; Mm - hmm . ; then there 's amplification afterwards . ; And you can get ,
Bro016_498	s	Yeah . ; And Spanish , yeah . ; on which you could adjust things . ; And the and the German and Danish were the evaluation data .
Bmr012_1223	s	Off you go , ; yeah . ; OK ; so I guess people who have to leave can leave
Bed014_60	s	He - he he 's ; probably not , is my guess . ; Oh , then it 's just gonna be the five of us ? ; Well , he he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four .
Bmr012_356	s	Trent Lott . ; um I mean ; these are sort of funny ones , ; It 'll get those though .
Bmr014_247	aa	and ; Yeah . ; I I mean ; Yeah .
Bmr006_660	cc	I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Alright , I 'll find out from you .
Btr001_2133	bk	Um , ; as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_812	b	and I don't know exactly who to ask . ; I thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to . ; So , is it a lossless compression when you compress , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1636	s	w ; that it is a little bit more evol evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network , I would like to say . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet .
Bmr022_1303	%--	So if that 's at an ; Hmm . ; I guess it depends on Jane 's ; Uh , you know ,
Bro027_1706	s	So ; the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . ; Th ; So , by having an additional , uh , feature which says " this is speech and this is nonspeech " , I mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net .
Bns002_240	qw	OK ? ; So ; what are the differences uh , in this in this eh wireless transmission , regarding uh to the wireless to the wired ones . ; What what are the d the main differences .
Btr001_2163	b	Oh , yeah . ; I mean , it 's ; It didn't sound stran ; Hmm .
Bro027_392	b	Uh , this is slightly off topic ; but , uh , ; I noticed , just glancing at the , uh , Hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing I don't know Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_498	b	and , uh , those if ; Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty twenty years ago , ; so they 're it 's the the techniques work pretty well . ; Hmm .
Bed005_1247	s	If it 's , uh , a town hall , it 's point two , point three , point five . ; Right . ; And so forth . ; And we don't want to write this down necessarily every time for something
Bro027_682	bk	Yeah . ; This is the first try . ; I mean , I maybe the LDA 's not very useful then . ; Right ,
Bed004_190	b	Are you sure ? ; No , I don't know . ; Not that I know of . ; Right .
Bmr022_1285	b	or ; right ? ; So that , when you 're developing it and it 's really rough , you don't put it in the repository . ; Yeah .
Bro017_371	s	So the s m masking curve , normally it looks like sort of ; I start from from here , ; so you you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . ; And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .
Bmr003_2495	b	Ask them if they have an extra one . ; Who knows , they might have an extra hardware s ; I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1031	b	It 's like the history of ICSI . ; You worked with P - files . ; Like ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_980	b	Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , uh , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh , noise removal , uh , with with these other things we have , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , looks like a worthy thing to to do here . ; Uh , yeah .
Bro028_1194	s	Um , the other one was , um , to , uh , come up with a a a model um , a graphical model , that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables , latent variables , that we don't know anything about , ; but that through , um , s statistical training and the EM algorithm , um , at the end of the day , we have , um we have learned something about these these latent , um latent variables ; which happen to correspond to intermediate categories . ; Um . Yeah , and so those are the the two directions that I 'm I 'm looking into right now .
Bro013_629	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And uh uh , given you know , given that , uh you could uh uh come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by uh uh those harmonics . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1419	b	Mm - hmm . ; you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . ; I mean the u u ; Hmm .
Bro016_939	bk	Right . ; So . ; How are , uh , uh how are things going with what you 're doing ? ; Oh .
Bns002_460	g	Yeah . ; so , ; you cannot u usually you cannot , uh , read the data packet until you the reception is over . ; OK ?
Bed015_286	bk	uh ; Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . ; So I don't know what a form type is . ; Oh , I see .
Bro008_99	s	Oh , ; OK . ; And , um , the other systems were , uh , somewhat lower than that . ; There was actually there was much less of a huge range than there was in Aurora one .
Bro010_115	s	which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech ; so . ; Uh , ; this is the first thing .
Bro019_1066	b	now we have this um , meeting data . ; You know , like the stuff we 're recording right now , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1114	s	No . We wouldn't . ; OK , ; but then so basically it 's just a for every construction we have a node in the net , right ? ; And we turn on that node .
Btr002_3000	s	It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ , ; Mm - hmm . ; they do this thing . ; I shouldn't do that so often .
Bro007_127	s	Yeah . ; Um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition ; it 's uh it brings something . ; Uh but uh actually apparently there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay .
Bsr001_2267	s	Hmm . ; I don't know . ; Not eliminated entirely . ; There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens ,
Bed006_1218	s	but the categories inside of action schemas , ; so , SPG action is a category . ; Real ; although I think what we 're specifying here is this is a category where the actions " enter , view and approach " would fall into
Bmr022_441	b	I 'll talk to Brian , and see what he ; Yeah , single digit numbers ; That also appeals to me . So that you don't have to , you know ; Yeah .
Bro019_1138	s	that , like , the auto - correlation , the R - zero and R - one over R - zero ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si uh , spectrum of the signal
Bmr022_144	%--	Yeah . ; The other thing you can do ; This is on the mixed signal , ; or are these the individual
Bmr023_1034	b	Right ? ; OK . ; So one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that ; Yes .
Btr002_380	b	and you think to yourself , " You were way off , ; Yeah . ; but at least you knew you were way off . " ; Yeah .
Bdb001_619	s	Well , that 's why I didn't call it " sentence " . ; So , ; right . ; Um , so it 's like a segment or something .
Bmr006_907	s	You have your own ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Oh ! ; I ha I have prepare .
Bmr028_84	s	Yeah . ; So . ; So do you have to pad that out ? Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ? ; No . I the audio file you can specify any sampling rate .
Bro022_1213	b	I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames ; and then apply the VAD , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_755	%--	Is the rising pitch a feature , ; or is it gonna be in the same file ? ; Well , the rising pitch will never be hand - annotated . ; So the all the prosodic features are going to be automatically
Btr002_2451	%--	and and you said , " Don't do " lipsmack " , ; just do we don't need it 's too specific . ; Just do " mouth " for all tha all those noises " . ; Yeah , OK . Now what I would say um ,
Bmr014_1066	%--	And then then my concern about which ; Yeah . ; I agree . ; you know you might be right , it may be it was just paranoia on my part , uh but people just
Bro014_184	b	So this just adds one . ; Except that , uh , actually for the silence model , it 's six mixtures per state . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr026_160	s	Mm - hmm . ; O K . ; Finally said he was too busy . ; I guess we reached it .
Bmr018_1183	s	Uh , actually I have to to go . ; I mean , this is tough for a language model probably ; Right . ; but but that might be useful just for speech .
Btr002_2770	aa	Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice . ; but I 've seen a several " breath " 's too . ; Hmm ! ; Yeah ! Yeah .
Buw001_515	s	and how ; because the summary will drive the queries . ; So ; What I I think , you know , in most meetings ,
Bmr011_499	s	And you get really , really good beam - forming with that sort of thing . ; Wow . ; And it 's and , um , ; in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing
Bmr013_621	%	So , um , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . ; OK . ; And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2393	b	Right . ; Right ? ; The antenna 's right there , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_127	b	And so I I think we 'd probably the models would be better in some than in others . ; Hmm . ; Um , so , uh . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . ; Hmm .
Bed010_197	bk	Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case ; you know , construction parser for general constructions . ; And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later . ; OK .
Btr002_551	s	if that part of the brain normally codes for , you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer , then they might not be able to . ; You know . Does that make sense ? ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; Like if that part is damaged .
Bmr016_170	b	if the people say a hundred instead of " one OO " . ; and also w maybe we can just let them choose " zero " versus " O " as they as they like ; because even the same person c sometimes says " O " and sometimes says " zero " in different context , ; Yeah .
Bns003_582	s	See for me it 's the same ; I can also say , uh , ; for me everything has completely changed , ; so now I go back and I don't anything what to do ,
Bro026_615	b	Yeah . ; yeah . ; Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_127	b	I 'm sorry , but you 're o alphabetical , that 's why I 'm choosing you ; And then if you look across the right , then that 's where he was the person who was the sp first speaker in the pair and got overlap overlapped with by somebody . ; Hmm ! ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_119	s	Mm - hmm . ; But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , ; you know . ; Right . I mean , we because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things .
Bed014_332	s	uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . ; So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances ; and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , ; so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate .
Bed003_904	b	The safety net . ; I think you could just add it . ; I mean , I have before ; OK .
Bro011_573	s	Mm - hmm . ; and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . ; Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an HMM system is that you use um three states per phone ; and um so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three .
Bsr001_551	b	or ? ; Oh yeah , it does . ; When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one . ; Uh Uh - huh .
Bmr016_302	s	Mm - hmm . ; Are the patterns like are they based on anything or ; Um , I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there , ; and they 're usually grouped into either two , three , or four , four digits at a time .
Bmr003_941	s	Right . ; but if if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there . ; Right . ; And the other thing too is with with speaker identification ,
Bmr016_653	s	and so the rec you know , there 're error rates ; because of insertion ; Insertions aren't bounded , ; so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .
Bro016_662	%--	and so on . ; So , that 's a move of two hundred fifty hertz . ; Whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty - five hundred hertz , you know , might be out to thirty - seven fifty , ; you know so it 's at
Bro023_1304	s	OK . ; You mean , the m the mean is computed o based on some frames in the future also ? ; Or or no ? ; It 's the recursion ,
Bro028_959	s	And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , um , PLP . ; I should learn more about that . ; And then the second stage is , um , the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do . ; It 's , um it computes features which are , um , based on sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions used to analyze the input .
Bro018_1009	s	Hmm . ; Uh and you can certainly play with that . ; But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first . ; Yeah just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up .
Bmr021_274	b	No - not quite a slam . ; There 's some knocks . ; Get a special phone for that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_250	s	right ? ; Because e e this is downsampled and and filtered , ; right ? ; So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone .
Bmr001_645	s	We 'll have a fair amount of annoyance ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; yeah I think
Bro011_595	s	you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . ; Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , uh you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , ; Mm - hmm . ; but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many .
Bro010_67	ar	OK . ; and ; You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? ; No .
Bmr005_724	b	Uh - huh . ; There 's there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , ; and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth ; Yeah .
Bmr027_532	s	Yep . ; And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something ; and they wouldn't actually hear from us , ; and then they find this thing is in there
Bro023_1458	no	but I still have to to look more at this , ; um , ; at the level of noise I add after . Uh , I know that adding noise helped , um , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing , ; but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one .
Btr001_550	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Right .
Bmr022_917	s	Or what do they ; Yep . ; They wear the heads ; E Well , there you go .
Btr002_1552	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Now I know what you 're talking about . ; Yeah .
Bro004_850	s	Uh , Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they , although they don't talk about it in this note , ; um , there 's um , the issue of the um Mu law business uh versus the logarithm ,
Bed006_1126	ba	Yeah . ; and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that that you want to constant draw from from sub - tasks um that are relevant ; M Th ; uh I mean but very difficult .
Bro021_690	bk	So then , I 'm a little lost on the rest . ; Oh , I mean ; What what what ? ; Oh , yeah .
Btr001_1241	%--	And they and they capitalize like every single first ; I really th ; Yeah . ; And they put paren
Bsr001_973	s	But it @ @ bu ; The host probably gets , uh , you know gets a little bit more . ; Yeah . ; My feeling is that when I when I when I 've seen that show it 's like there there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor
Bmr002_593	s	Yeah . ; I should 've ; Although , they actually have a nice tool for that could be used for speaker change marking . ; There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools .
Bed005_1178	%	uh , ; eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be . ; And it 's it 's sort of not a great estimate , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_330	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; And and I was just thinking that , um , if it were possible to bring that in , like , you know , this week , ; Uh - huh .
Bro010_656	s	I mean , imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , ; Mmm . ; right ? ; So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz .
Bed012_321	s	Let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Info - on has True or False and Location . ; So , he wants to know something about it ,
Bro014_15	ba	Alright ! ; Let 's do image processing . ; Yes , again . ; Great .
Bed016_231	s	And so forth . ; So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge ; but if it 's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . ; Um , and so forth and so forth .
Bed002_460	s	going , walking , seeing , ; we can mem model all of that ; and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . ; That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding .
Bmr002_1081	%--	But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well . ; And I could be wrong . ; Well , my my impression ; I I I really thought of these resources in the context of you you asking about time aligning the
Bmr016_477	bk	So . ; Mmm . ; but I think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like Dan to play around with , ; OK .
Bro016_475	%--	adding the noises from from the SpeechDat - Car . ; Um . ; That 's ; that 's , uh
Bro025_260	bk	No . ; Just using either their VAD or our current VAD . ; Our way . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr022_985	bk	I wonder if you could do an adaptor . ; I don't know if you can or not . ; Anyway , it 's just an idea . ; Yeah .
Bed015_648	%--	I didn't know that . ; Yeah , yeah . ; I I mean , I I was a little bit surprised about it too . ; I knew that
Bmr015_468	s	Yeah , there there would be there would be new hires , ; and and there there would be expansion , ; but , ; also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off ,
Bmr026_1265	bk	Alright . ; Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . ; Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of ; yeah
Bmr013_992	b	Just the lapel itself . ; Um , and then one of the one of those . ; Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , um , and try them out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1125	%--	In university atmosphere you get a little different thing . ; But ; you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour , ; he 's worth "
Bmr013_265	b	To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? ; It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g ; uh , I mean that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , uh , rather than vowels . ; Yeah .
Bed003_443	s	Unknown , ; So final dest ; right ? ; So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist ,
Bro005_929	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Then uh some questions without answers .
Bmr002_797	bk	These things do seem to be ; Mitre , ; That 's the Text Encoding Initiative . ; Oh .
Bdb001_641	s	But , uh , what I don't understand is where the where in this type of file that would be expressed . ; Right . ; You would have another tag somewhere . ; It 's well , there 're two ways of doing it .
Bed015_2102	aa	You consult consult your ontology ; which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh ; Grout out the things that that you need . ; Right .
Bsr001_1978	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions . ; Yeah .
Bed005_884	b	and - and - and tons of stuff . ; So , th the database is huge , ; and if we want to answer a question on that , we actually have to go one step before that , and understand that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1005	b	um If you model the the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else 's microphone , as well as on that , and you build , um ; basically I think you 'd you would build a an HMM that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations ; All the Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_284	s	But , the qu So So they 'll be ; This is I w want to point to visual things , ; But I mean they there 'll be time There 'll be overlap between the distributions , ; but the question is , " If it 's a reasonable feature at all , there 's some separation . "
Bro010_1164	s	like a second maybe . ; And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to , um include the whole , um , reverberation ; um , I don't know what you call it ; the reverberation response .
Bmr006_826	qw	Yeah . ; OK . ; " Why ? ; Why ?
Bmr016_1145	s	and at that point I pick up things like , oh , you know , word followed by two commas . ; And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . ; And if not , then that gets checked . ; Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called " spoken - forms " .
Bmr012_1015	s	I was just wondering if if that could change . ; but ; I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff . ; If we could drop that .
Bro011_231	b	maybe will be good result or bad result , ; we don't know . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_152	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; Is fixed . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_868	aa	Yeah . ; Uh , because cuz we 've had With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time , uh , we 've really had no tr no trouble with this at all , ; So I 'll just go d I 'll do that . ; Yep .
Bmr012_1007	s	I have no idea . ; But each each fiber channel has eight eight channels ; and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card . ; It might be a hard limitation ,
Bmr009_1339	no	But there 's a town . ; Oh . ; in in there . ; I forget what it is @ @ .
Bro012_1226	b	and he was ; and and got some some decent results doing that . ; So that that 's another another way . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1013	ba	uh , ; I think it 's a neat thing . ; it seems l you know ; Uh , it seems like a good idea .
Bmr003_2167	b	Which means two at each station . ; Well that that 's the way people sit . ; That 's how many chairs are in the room . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1358	qw	I see . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; What 's what 's that ?
Bmr015_358	s	I ; Yeah . ; I should go back and look . ; I didn't I don't think that 's true .
Bro021_516	bk	Oh , so then you 'll feed those ; Sorry . ; So where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ? ; Oh .
Bmr028_928	bd	N well , but you can use the ; when you 're doing the scoring Since you 're you 're gonna be scoring against transcript , you can use ; You mean you wanna cheat . ; Well , you 're doing that anyway .
Bro018_423	b	I I don't know if there are many people who are going to ICASSP ; Yeah . ; so so I thought , make sure somebody go . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_673	s	And so that that 's a minor part of it , ; I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . ; So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um I would take them , and generate the web pages ; and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted ,
Bed014_1257	ba	Yeah . ; OK , then certainly we will . ; Yeah , you should definitely , um be on on that ; Good .
Bed008_1355	%--	OK , so ; so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh W one times ; Point three . ; or A or
Bmr016_317	s	And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly .
Bro027_324	%--	So they 're , like ; um ; So they are actually trying to , uh , fix that those values using the clean , uh , training part of the Wall Street Journal . ; Which is
Bro004_180	2	Yeah . Yeah . ; OK . ; But the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from ; Already ,
Buw001_725	s	So if you can find some really , you know , low , uh , perplexity , ; Low fidelity . ; Yeah . ; yeah , way of of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile .
Btr001_397	b	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_834	qh	Yeah , we have , I think , some . ; Yeah . ; Do you see this word " application " related to a network ? ; Or do you see this word independently ?
Bed015_1882	bk	Mmm . ; don't try to do them in detail or formally ; but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . ; OK .
Bmr007_964	bh	Well , I I ; This is this is not what I was suggesting to do . ; u Look , I I think this is a ; Really ?
Bdb001_803	ar	That 's different from searching through the text . ; But it seems like as long as the features that ; Well , ; no , no , no .
Bmr020_1092	%--	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; In any case , this this uh , meeting that I hand
Btr002_806	s	Cuz if you miss something and you wanna go back to it , it 's such a such a hassle . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's true . ; It 'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like , you know , uh , opposite of tab that you could hit , that it would just sort of move backwards .
Bmr019_1421	s	It 's very specific . ; uh w in ninety - nine ; and it 's it 's sort of a it 's ; Well , that 's maybe why they don't f know that they have a crummy system .
Bmr030_95	s	so it 's just a question of , did Morgan get around to testing it . ; Yeah , and I sent you an email ; Yeah , I got it . With the instructions . ; with the instructions .
Bro016_1028	bs	No ; Um , why don't you say something about what it is ? ; Oh , ; you oh , you want you want details .
Btr002_575	b	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bro007_269	s	or ; Yeah . ; right . ; So these these are word error rates
Bmr012_1148	ar	Well or also for you know if people are not ; Yeah . ; Well we could just hand around the lapel . ; Uh no
Bro026_766	b	Somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and ; ju Yeah , I th I think . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_1161	b	So , that means we 'll probably wanna convert all all those files filesystems to non - backed - up media . ; That sounds good . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_590	s	I mean , it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing ; but , ; Yep . ; yeah , I kind of agree with Andreas ,
Bmr016_2125	b	Mm - hmm . ; And they 're still gonna be transcribed as READ . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1110	b	So , ; Hnh . ; and al Oh ! And I also wanna say , that , um , I 'd like to meet again also next week , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_201	s	But they were they seemed pretty good . ; I mean , the Sony ones are expensive ; because they 're proprietary , ; so they can charge whatever they want .
Bed003_1124	no	Ah yes , good . ; " Source " . ; That 's that 's quite nice . ; I don't know if it actually manipulate the source , though .
Bro025_244	b	Outside the beginnings and end . ; Yeah . ; And all the speech pauses , ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_101	s	Yeah . It 's a ritual . ; Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? ; Is that ; We could .
Bmr013_911	s	So a lot of little details , ; but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . ; So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer ; and we can , can run these .
Bro028_704	s	but the log probabilities ; we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities , ; and so we can model them better . ; So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities ,
Btr001_957	aa	I ; He does it a ; OK . ; yeah .
Bmr016_773	b	and it does all sorts of matches ; because the way people filled out names is different on every single file ; so it does a very fuzzy sort of match . ; Right .
Bmr016_934	b	cuz we 're basically duplicating the originals , um ; Yeah . ; Then it 's fine . ; Right .
Bro010_519	b	So there are tricks like this ; but , mmm . ; Hmm ! ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1455	bk	And it just , you know it just didn't come together ; Just ; Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said " no " they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . ; OK .
Bed014_316	b	Yeah , it 's hard . ; It 's a hard puzzle . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1333	s	Yeah . ; Um . Yeah . I was just going to comment that I I 'm going to , uh , be on the phone with Mari tomorrow , late afternoon . ; Oh , yeah . ; We 're supposed to get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things .
Bmr016_968	%--	but it 's ; but it 's um ; " That 's just not right , man . " ; These are long These are long
Bmr028_71	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh ; So what I did is I just took the file with those in it , converted it so that it looks like an audio file . ; Right .
Bmr030_297	ba	Yeah . ; So so you There 's a trade - off ; Yeah . It ; It 's kind of a useless one .
Bmr014_349	b	And the and the recordings also , ; Um ; just where we are . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_405	s	Yeah . ; You know people who lie about it ? ; Oh yeah . ; Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says " optional " they might not .
Bmr012_1074	b	And and see if that works . ; And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more . ; Comfort . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1437	s	Oh . ; Alternating . ; Uh - huh . ; And this week we were gonna try to do t automatic transcription status .
Bed006_884	b	So very specific role names are " viewed thing " , " entered thing " ; think think of enter , view and approach as frames ; and they have frame - specific parameters and and roles ; Yeah .
Bed009_697	b	and it 's it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things . ; and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before ; and the function modeler and a self - description of the um external service haggle it out ; Hmm .
Bro007_541	%--	Yeah . ; What ? ; Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas ; and
Bmr008_415	ba	Yeah . ; They uh that , you know , i if you say " Optional " then it 's sort of ; if people who get nervous about the age question then they realize that " Oh well , but they 're not trying to ask me lots of things . " ; Yeah , I think it 's OK .
Bmr029_418	%--	Right . ; Right . So ; OK . Well , I 'll I can get started on the ; well , the first the one that already has a
Bed014_857	ba	This is the first time I 've seen a thesis proposal change . ; Right . Anyway , uh . So . ; Really ? ; But , yeah , a second that would be great .
Bed017_350	ba	That should be one of them . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Right . ; That 'd be nice .
Bro027_1396	qw	Ah . OK . ; So what i what about , um i u what i w ; I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not , ; but what if you put ran the other kind of LDA , uh , on your features right before they go into the HMM ?
Bmr019_905	s	Yeah . ; and it was a Meeting Recorder meeting . ; Um . ; But , yeah , we should try to use what you have .
Bns003_312	bk	an ; another thing is I 'd want to get a link on the logo so that you can come from the logo to the ICSI web p home page back . ; To the home page . ; OK .
Bro018_273	co	you should do that anyway , ; Yeah . ; OK ? ; Given this this uh regular old net that 's just for choosing for other purposes , uh add up the probabilities of the different subclasses and see see how well you do .
Bmr009_729	s	Not now . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Um If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times .
Bns002_1518	%--	but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff . ; And University of Uppsala , Sweden , ; that 's the reason I invited uh Christian Tschudin , the professor who did ten years work in in active routing . ; And uh OK the Universidad Nacional de Educat
Bro018_841	s	Yeah , that makes sense , to check all that . ; Yeah . ; So I was doing that first , before I did these other things , just to make sure there wasn't something ; Although really , uh uh , a couple three percent uh difference in word error rate uh could easily come from some difference in normalization , I would think .
Bro022_59	%--	When is your , uh , meeting ? ; Um , my meeting ; Yeah . ; with , uh ?
Bmr016_276	s	I thought I thought it was read . ; I thought so . ; Was it read ? ; Yeah , I think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be OGI .
Bro023_394	s	Yeah , ; it 's like ten point one . ; Still the same . ; And the high mismatch is like eighteen point five .
Bed008_10	no	but I think we oughta just get started . ; Nancy is uh currently in Berkeley but not here ? ; Nancy 's still stick ? ; Don't know .
Bro014_421	%--	On what kind of roads ? ; Mm - hmm . ; With what passing you ? ; With
Bmr025_618	s	Hmm . ; Yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear ; but ; Yeah . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that ,
Bmr025_1018	aa	Should we do digits ? ; Anyway . ; Do we have anything else ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_1486	s	I think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it 's better that I don't speak . ; Yeah , well . ; Because ; You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime ,
Bro028_870	s	And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . And they do they said that they could do it for the test
Bro019_1127	b	You 're talking about your voicing ? ; Yeah . ; So maybe You probably need to back up a bit ; Yeah .
Bmr031_503	b	Mm - hmm . ; We should warn them that these disk space issues are gonna creep up on them very fast . ; uh , if they ; Yep . Yep .
Bmr001_325	s	Yeah . ; Yeah ; So I guess this a pretty dense group ; but it it 's getting a lot higher .
Bed016_688	qo	OK . ; In other news . ; OK , so , um , ; anything else you want to ask us about
Bro014_654	s	but but they 'll have it on some level . ; So , ; um . ; It seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't , you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline ,
Bed008_281	co	so let 's just leave it three with three for now ; Mm - hmm , ; mmm . Yeah . ; and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started .
Bmr030_656	b	Yeah . Yeah . ; Mmm . ; So . ; Hmm !
Bmr021_593	s	yeah , I kind of agree with Andreas , ; like I 'm a little bit ; I mean , these ; I looked at the naming conventions
Bmr015_306	s	So . ; When 's when 's the full proposal due ? ; Uh , I think April ninth , or something . ; So it 's about a month .
Bro019_195	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines ; Yeah .
Bed015_1306	s	OK , good . ; Let 's let 's mark that . ; So we need a c ; Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny .
Bmr016_1593	s	so , anyway . ; That 's interesting . ; Is the P - PTA working ? ; Right and sometimes , I mean , you see a couple of these that are actually " OK 's "
Bmr028_1304	b	And then it does also some ; but it constrains the words to lie within the t the time bins of the reference . ; Within the segment . ; Yep .
Bed003_330	qw	whether they discuss the admission fees . ; So we looked at the data ; Oh . ; and in a lot of data people were saying things like " Can I get to this place ? "
Bed008_320	s	Yeah . ; So that 's w w in our uh in in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . ; Oh , it was called mode , ; so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint .
Bed013_290	s	yeah . ; I 'll ask Eva about the E Bayes and she 's working on that . ; How is the generation XML thing ? ; I 'm gonna work on that today and tomorrow .
Bmr001_174	s	I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still , which is um ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets , ; but there 's this amplification problem . ; I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy . ; We 're actually recording I 'm I 'm going through it at the moment , but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this .
Bmr023_306	b	I I don't know yet how long that 'll take . ; Yeah . Um ; I mean in particular I would I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_522	bk	No . ; And I and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's if there 's any get his input on it . ; I don't think I don't think that 'll be ; Right .
Bmr009_898	fa	Oh ! I wasn't supposed to ; The digit form doesn't The digit ; Yeah . ; Sorry . Sorry .
Bed010_169	bk	Is there anything we can make use of ? ; Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? ; But none of that has a short time fuse . ; OK .
Bmr022_1384	s	But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong . ; Yeah , that 's a good point . ; Or overlooked or not overlooked . ; Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous ,
Bmr027_407	s	Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . ; Yeah , but w Mmm . ; Because ; what I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email .
Bmr014_1001	bk	OK . ; It just means they have the right to have it . ; Well the in ; Alright .
Bmr028_1535	s	But weren't you cheating in those experiments ? ; Yeah . ; That 's ; we weren't .
Bmr002_506	bk	Uh - huh . ; So ; and very well known in discourse analysis . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr012_1292	b	yeah that 's right . ; and I think that 's a good idea , ; Yeah exactly , ; yeah .
Bmr023_421	b	just so that we knew ; You could do it . ; It 's it 's complicated in that um , hhh , i hhh , i ; Yeah .
Bro024_1018	s	It 's ; and they had a very good result . ; What what was it ? ; It was thirty - five .
Bmr020_1490	s	They do already . ; Yeah . ; but w I mean we 're gonna adjust everything when we come back ; But what what we would like them to do is be conservative
Bmr005_1245	s	I mean , they already do what they do do whatever they do . ; So it 's uh , it 's So it 's so it 's another source . ; So I think it 's something we should look into , ; you know , we 'll collect what we collect here
Bed005_707	s	Mm - hmm . ; and you know , what what are these things referring to ? ; Not only anaphora , ; but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions ,
Bro024_365	bk	But at least the basic acoustics are gonna be the same . ; So f if it 's really in one kiosk , then I think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to ; because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic . ; Yeah .
Bed015_413	bk	By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back . ; Uh ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr003_2543	ba	Right , I mean , and if and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC . ; It 'll work the first time . ; I I trust Steve Jobs . ; Good .
Bmr003_863	aa	I 'm go ; S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much ; but anyway , enough to work with . ; Right .
Bmr003_2200	b	cuz the the he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage . ; So so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ? ; Well I w I I ; Hmm !
Bro016_53	s	Right . ; Oh , you 're talking about for th for our features . ; Right . ; So , I mean , i it it 's not the direction that you were working with that we were saying what 's the uh , what 's the best you can do with with mel cepstrum .
Bmr031_157	b	cuz I haven't I haven't figured out which ones they are y are yet . ; Right . ; But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_843	b	Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is . ; Mm - hmm . ; Alright , so that 's that 's the that 's the thesis level ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_759	bk	Do you get out a uh a vector of these ones and zeros and then try to find the closest matching phoneme to that vector , ; Mm - hmm . ; or ? ; Oh .
Bed014_433	%--	But , uh , but but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th ; End of next week . ; I thought you said beginning of n ; I mean .
Bed012_812	s	sk let 's let 's call it " Keith - Johno ; node " . ; Johno ? ; There is an H somewhere printed .
Btr002_1747	b	or to listen to . ; Both . ; Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap ; Yeah .
Bmr015_484	%--	Um , not clear yet . ; Other than the one who 's already here . ; Not clear yet . ; I mean we got we have
Bed012_296	t3	No . ; And , um , ; I 'm not drinking tea . ; What are you talking about ?
Bmr026_947	b	My impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much . ; Right . ; By just taking the top whatever ? ; Yep .
Bns002_583	s	So ; if they ; Because of this wall , if they are not neighbors , well , we can represent this putting this node like here . ; But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one .
Bro018_122	s	if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one . ; So just having the three output thing doesn't doesn't really buy you anything . ; Yeah . ; The issue is what you feed it .
Bro023_739	b	So what I did was like I p did this ; and then you I plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time . ; And that seems to be working . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_678	s	Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes . ; At least this is a private meeting . ; Right , exactly , ; OK , that 's the link .
Bro004_780	s	for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , ; so the qu ; the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . ; We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data
Bed005_200	b	Oh ! ; So it really is key word matching , basically . ; Really a se ; e yeah .
Buw001_707	b	Mm - hmm . ; And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_625	no	And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that ; but , um , you know , I 've th the ; So , ; I I don't know exactly where that 's going at this point .
Bmr011_1687	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . ; That 's right . ; Oh . Yeah , right .
Bns001_878	%--	and and whatever kind of thing . ; And we focus really on the networking stuff ; and going in more detail in this area . ; And the alternative is maybe what uh
Bmr019_435	ba	Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Oh , well .
Bmr003_1100	s	Well , they might they might quote it ; Yes , it is . ; For quoting meetings ? ; Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on .
Bro013_716	s	and um I want to try finding the the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller ; and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block . ; Mm - hmm . ; That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing .
Bns002_1001	s	And eh well some day in the future eh , a protocol should be chosen ; but , for the moment eh we have several of them on the table . ; and eh any protocol has some advantages and some disadvantages . ; The basic the basic problem we have to solve in in these eh routing protocols is the fast eh the fast pace at what eh topology changes can happen .
Bro024_70	s	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , he you talked about it . ; we we spoke about it already ,
Buw001_2287	aa	Find me a funny thing that Jeff said . ; So we need a laugh detector . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro004_89	b	OK , this this would be a good section for our silence detection . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um Oh .
Bed013_580	ba	And it 's also difficult to even if you had a lot of substance , it 's hard to demonstrate that in four pages , basically . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; That would be hard .
Bro013_248	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . ; Mm - hmm . ; It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all .
Bro004_375	s	I mean . That 's interesting ; because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English , ; because in the other case you don't get hurt any more , ; at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse ,
Bmr020_236	ba	Yeah . ; and so they 're so good that generally , u the overlapped speech does not is less than five percent . ; Oh , ; that 's interesting .
Bro013_782	%--	OK . ; So so it 's ; Yeah . ; So it 's it 's
Bns003_156	s	Mm - hmm . ; So ; you download it , if that s must be possible from the network , ; but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than , uh , one box which you have on your desktop ,
Bed013_1275	s	For the subset of ; human beings are not allowed to ask anything but " where is X " . ; OK . ; This is the only utterance in the world .
Bro018_38	b	Uh - huh . ; the with the new code . ; And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum , ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_1167	s	Mmm . ; So . ; When Yeah . ; When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center .
Bro007_309	s	I see . ; OK . ; And what and what 's OGI forty - five ? ; Uh it 's o it 's OGI two ,
Bro028_491	aa	On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . At these noise levels . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1341	%--	Right . ; Uh - huh . ; blah - blah - blah . ; And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning
Bmr009_572	t1	but if It it would be much better if you can do it . ; You 'd be much better at doing it also ; because you know , I I 'm not I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out , ; Interesting .
Buw001_1375	aa	But ; Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " . ; And and those those can be two different things . ; Uh , yeah , yeah .
Bmr021_625	b	OK . ; There was a typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone , ; one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between " sponsor " and their name . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_856	s	but we do not have any expert anymore . ; Because Hannes was an expert for that . ; So the problem for me , it still exists that we have , in principle , here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side . ; We could have a certain kind of application
Bro003_953	s	There 's three of you . ; Uh , ; so that 's ; Yeah . One hundred each , about .
Bed012_731	%--	And , um , finish up this Bayes - net . ; And once we have finished it , I guess we can , um ; and that 's going to be more just you and me , ; because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh ,
Bro021_420	b	So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients , ; not thirteen ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_193	aa	Well . The cube ? ; I should tell him about the cube ? ; Yeah . ; Oh ! Cube . Yeah .
Bro012_560	b	Um . ; Yeah . ; For the moment , they are working on integrating the um spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1033	b	Yeah , right . ; n uh ; Let 's see . ; Yep .
Bmr020_1093	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; In any case , this this uh , meeting that I hand ; I I hand - adjusted two of them
Bed014_1284	ba	but different perspec ; Yeah . ; like " This make you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . ; This makes no sense . "
Bro019_1361	aa	to ; Moments , ; yeah . ; yeah .
Bsr001_2032	aa	But that ; Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz ; Yes , ; yeah , yeah .
Bro012_683	aa	uh ; It made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear ; Maybe we could just like , talk into a cup . ; Yeah .
Bro004_547	2	and yet we 're seeing some kind of effect ; yeah . ; At least at least for the first for the well - matched , ; Well matched condition .
Bmr020_1809	s	So th ; Yeah . ; OK . ; there was a category for @ @ speech .
Bed008_879	b	I don't know . ; Situation Go - there , ; I mean , because it 's whether it 's open or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_857	aa	if they laugh between two words , you you 'd get it in between the two words . ; Mm - hmm . ; But if they laugh across three or four words you you get it after those four words . ; Right .
Bmr001_618	b	right ? ; Right . ; So it 's connected . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_472	h	So , what 's the turn around period right now from IBM ? ; Well , they There was ; Should we be discussing this , ; OK .
Bed013_79	s	Absolutely . ; OK . ; And once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself . ; And answer ,
Bro016_138	b	OK . ; Uh . ; I probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_81	co	Get out of the ; Yeah . ; Hold on . ; Hold on .
Bed012_312	bk	and say " OK . " ; Well , yeah , but in the s uh , let 's just deal with the s the simple case of we 're not worrying about timing or anything . ; We just want to know how we should answer " Where is X ? " ; OK .
Bmr026_1008	s	Even that that number ; Right . ; uh , we never did any ; And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data ,
Bro025_555	s	If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth ; Yeah . ; any more . ; Yeah . But the Guenter 's argument is slightly different .
Bmr003_621	qy	I object to that characterization ! ; Oh , really . ; I meant Joy . ; And so again , I have to say " are we recording "
Bed015_712	ba	and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . ; OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I we have thoughts about those as well . ; Yeah . ; Great .
Bmr005_957	bk	That was about ten hours , and there was about ; t ten It 's like ten meetings or something ? ; Yeah , something like that . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr031_1437	ba	Don 's and the one across from him . ; And then also , um , working with Jeremy on Communicator emotion labelling . ; And most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion ; and that 's going pretty well now .
Bro004_1143	b	This is ; that 's what I was just gonna ask . ; How can you just throw out frames ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_1023	s	I don't know if that 's true or not , ; but I could see how ; Mmm . ; Maybe that 's what you were thinking .
Bro012_287	b	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; So it 's very , very few parameters compared to how much training data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_155	s	Well . So we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . ; Um . ; Are you gonna use which of the two techniques ? ; So finally it 's it 's , um , Wiener filtering on FFT bins .
Btr001_562	s	Um ; Oh , good to know . ; Yeah . ; Oh , there 's no question .
Bed005_952	bk	Hmm . ; Yeah , I thought I should , um , talk a little bit about that , ; because that might be a good , uh , sort of architecture to have , in general for , uh , problems with , you know , multiple inputs to a node . ; Good ! OK .
Bro003_1209	b	I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the uh , a all these combinations , ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_811	s	um ; Oh , well , I have the picture . ; t ; we w basically we are still playing with Matlab to to look at at what happened ,
Bmr019_171	%--	So , it 's , um that 's the number there . ; Point six , I believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation . ; Right . ; But I think one thing is that , uh , I would presume
Bed016_715	qy	I had two hours w with George on this , ; OK , what did he say . ; so it , ; Did you ?
Bro013_408	s	Both should have sixty - five because ; Yeah . ; You didn't gain anything , right ? ; And . So I did that
Bmr011_1324	b	So I 'm gonna try . Go to their meeting tomorrow ; Mm - hmm . ; and see if we can try , uh , to convince them ; Good .
Bmr008_796	s	Mm - hmm . ; But Other is there , and people will fill that out . ; e But do you think those three are OK ? ; They 'll see by example .
Bns001_703	b	In UMTS you have always GPS as a a involvement in the core network . ; You have , in principle , the path which still is available for for the GSM network . ; Also they use , in principle , the same uh the same mechanism . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_421	%--	Mm - hmm . ; OK ? ; And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out OK . ; But I think that um
Bmr026_893	s	But um . ; So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; Well they been using TIMIT .
Bro026_315	bk	Would it I mean But ; When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , OK .
Bro011_222	%--	or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? ; No . ; No , no n we have n we have do the experiment ; only have the feature the feature but the experiment have
Bmr006_47	%--	What a deal . ; uh Yeah . ; And what 's he interested in , specifically ? ; So
Bro004_870	2	And is this with the revised on - line normalization ? ; Ye - Uh , with the old older , ; Yeah . ; Old one .
Bmr018_1462	s	it has to be , though , someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing . ; Someone who actually does take notes , ; um , I 'm very bad at note - taking . ; But I think what 's interesting is there 's all these different evaluations , like just , you know , how do you evaluate whether the summary is good or not ,
Bmr020_1216	s	So , ; I 'm @ @ now I 'm confused . ; OK . ; We start with your presegmented version
Bmr016_294	qw	so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference . ; Uh , you know it 's not ; OK . ; Hey Liz , What what do the groupings represent ?
Bro021_1040	%--	No ? ; Right . ; Right . ; And then how do you go from there to the ?
Bmr024_670	s	Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other . ; Nnn , well ; Yeah . ; They 're just not face to face .
Bro024_1397	bk	Uh , ; but Yeah . ; Mmm ; Yep .
Bdb001_422	s	Yeah , ; they 're reasonably compatible . ; I mean , you you could ; You could probably translate between them .
Bmr014_169	co	So yeah so the only ; Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . ; Right . ; Oh , we should do it .
Bed008_406	%--	Right . ; So here here 's what it looks like to me . ; is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . ; So that it uh
Btr002_2731	b	And I usually always take those out . ; Yeah . ; I mean , usually , um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often just sort of , um , segments ; Great .
Bmr015_749	b	It 's it 's it 's I haven't worked with that either ; so I 'm not sure ; The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1811	s	We did not forget . ; We are done . ; Yeah , just leave them on for now . ; Sometimes if you turn it off while it 's recording it crashes
Bmr019_539	%--	So we would then use that one , too , ; So ; This is kind of central . ; or ?
Bed006_912	s	I was just staring at this while you were talking , ; sorry . ; It 's OK . ; Uh a link between the action schema , a field in the s in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use
Bmr028_244	s	but then at least you 're covered if if , uh if there 's a problem . ; Yeah , if there are any problems . ; Right . ; Yeah , I mean , even five minutes is probably enough .
Btr001_590	aa	no . ; Huh . ; Euh . ; No .
Bro004_484	bk	It 's uh the one hundred number . ; It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline . ; Ah ! ; Ah , OK , OK .
Bed010_1079	b	Aikin , Alex , yeah . ; Yeah , figured . ; That would have been i my guess . ; Hmm .
Bed011_206	s	They 're just gonna select u um , according to their preferences . ; Yeah , yeah . ; " Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit castles , or I usually " ; And then you pick that one .
Bro019_724	s	Yeah . ; because it 's artificially added noise . ; Yeah . ; But this is natural recording .
Bmr021_750	s	And the other difference is that in the , uh in the SRI system , the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest . ; And what they do is they d they subtract the maximum ; Huh . ; For each waveform segment they subtract the maximum of of th over that waveform segment from from the values of for that waveform .
Bed015_940	co	And it would ; oh , I 'm sorry , ; yeah , ; go ahead ,
Bmr006_257	b	Right . ; But if there were such a ; I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . ; Yep .
Btr001_2505	b	And I just kept laughing and laughing and laughing . ; Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bro019_808	s	But for speech recognition , it may not . ; I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . ; I see . ; So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .
Bro011_516	b	So where did he get his uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? ; From uh canonical mappings um at first ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1848	bk	or should we i give it to them and let them do with it what they can ? ; I think we should just ; it it 's gonna be too much work if we hafta worry about that I think . ; OK ,
Buw001_244	b	There we go . ; They ; and no one ever did . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1039	g	If the thing is a landmark , you know , um then there 's another thing that says if um ; if it 's closed or not , at the moment . ; Alright , so you have nodes . ; Right ?
Bmr026_506	s	I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , ; Right . ; Yep . ; but But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks .
Btr002_2502	s	I don't know , like , um Hhh . ; I would say " tongue click " for that . ; Yeah . ; But I would also probably put in parentheses it that I thought it was a vocal gesture .
Btr002_2184	s	Hmm . ; No no visual input at all . ; Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation , ; and other things like that .
Bro027_821	bk	Maybe it 's better to wait ; OK . ; for the decision ; Yeah .
Bmr012_636	s	so ; I mean this way we least have a baseline ; we know that for instance the transcripts are very good ; so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text
Bro027_183	s	but , um , ; it , uh ; I guess , I maybe I said this last week too ; but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise .
Bro018_150	s	I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough ; or maybe there 's something else that that one could use , ; but I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here , ; so here 's here 's an idea .
Bed005_1064	aa	you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state . ; So ; S so , this is a fanciful way of saying " default " ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr011_1783	s	what happened with the the different parameters . ; And only with a different bands of color for the , uh , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe .
Bed015_1452	s	Dutch ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , Dutch . ; and , um but very confused background I think .
Bro014_1572	aa	Um . ; Sure . ; I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_856	s	But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing . ; And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector . ; And so I think that might work . ; But , I haven't gotten very far on that .
Bmr007_934	aa	In a first step , I mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; An - and then , eh eh without considering the you you you , um you can consider the energy like a another parameter in the in the feature vector , ; Right .
Bed008_696	s	No but , it 's more than that , ; like the the more sort of you break it up ; like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential ; whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore .
Bed010_921	bk	OK . ; And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space , ; It 's possible yeah . ; OK .
Bed006_155	ba	Yep , yep , yep . ; OK . ; So . ; That 's good .
Bed005_9	bk	Mmm Doesn't , uh It should be the other way . ; Yeah , now it 's on . ; Right . OK . ; OK .
Bmr008_433	b	I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's an important point the other way ; Mm - hmm . ; and I don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it . ; Yeah .
Bro024_361	s	Uh , there 's been some discussion about whether the work we 're doing in that project is gonna be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both . ; And I think for this kind of discussion it matters . ; If it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same . ; It 's gonna you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gonna differ depending on the person and so forth .
Bro016_154	qw	I wonder if there 's anything that we could do to the front - end that would affect the insertion ; Yes . ; I think you can . ; What could you do ?
Bmr019_987	b	and embedde embedded in overlaps . ; The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal , ; which , you know , I mean , you c not not too surprising . ; Right .
Bmr015_833	s	and to discuss here , ; because , eh , I haven't enough feeling to to u many time to to understand what happened with the with , eh , so many peaks , ; eh , eh , ; and I I see the harmonics there many time
Bro014_1327	%--	The mean is different with it , ; because the the histogram for the the classifica ; No , no , no . ; But th the kind of robustness to noise
Bmr024_869	s	So ; which is near saturation , apparently . ; So . ; Soon .
Bmr028_1711	%--	Right . Exactly . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; And actually , an an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and and m you know , maybe just ; Oh , I don't know if a transcr uh
Bro015_75	%--	and ; They they t I think they will tend to go this way , but hmm . ; Uh . ; Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also
Bmr008_1079	ba	So , although the email email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it . ; Yeah . ; We 'll be able to backtrack from email . ; I like that .
Bns001_100	s	OK ? ; So , nodes act as both end points and routers . ; eh ; I 've in the study for some time these kind of networks .
Bmr013_917	b	And ; so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , ; uh , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_721	ba	No , I think there 's a lot ; explaining my m ; Yeah . ; I think there 's a lot of research .
Bed017_701	s	KILL ; KALIL . ; And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . ; In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS ,
Bed011_1140	bk	most likely in the beginning of June . ; Uh - huh , ; I 'll be gone . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_52	s	So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files ; and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms . ; I have this web - based speaker form , ; and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form ,
Bmr003_1527	aa	and and we were handling things while he was labeling the the whatever it was , ; the PDA ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr015_823	s	Yeah . ; But , i i uh I mean i i ; but , um , ; other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon .
Bmr010_1041	s	Uh - huh . ; and I also ; m I ; think they know that the data p source is limited
Bro021_853	s	I will read because it 's better for my English . ; I i given ; is the estimate of the PDF of the noise signal ; when we have a , um , a statistic of the clean speech and an statistic of the noisy speech .
Bed005_420	%--	When there 's a feature . ; Yeah . ; And so whenever I just say , " Write " , it will it will put this in here . ; Oh , so it always just
Bmr022_1462	b	Yes . ; Definitely . ; And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in , they 'll check it out once , ; Yep .
Bed003_996	qw	Yep . ; Command line . ; Huh . ; What is the c code ?
Bro016_332	%	Uh , what 's old with you that 's developed ? ; Um . ; I 'm sorry ? ; You
Bmr003_384	s	So ; um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . ; Yeah , ; I saw it .
Bsr001_1466	b	and you have a spreadsheet up there , ; and everybody has to sort of work out the you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money . ; And they can t ask the computer to switch things around in different columns or something like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1225	%--	And maybe there are two um ; So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . ; Maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di ; if this
Btr001_840	%--	So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe , there 's pauses somehow , ; I guess ; Hmm . ; or the you can
Bed005_1124	ba	OK . ; And Uh ; One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? " ; Yeah , it 's a good question .
Bns001_1660	s	And the networking guy said OK it would be great to have Multicast and all these kind of things in the network , ; but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for applications , ; there were new app old application make use of it ; and how can new application arise
Bmr007_925	b	Do something . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; But his his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_1324	g	I mean , I don't know how you get them into the vocabulary , ; but it would seem @ @ ; Now , I have to I have to I really need to , uh , raise a question about the term " cheating " . ; OK ?
Bed006_590	b	and then the person is presented with what 's running on TV ; in Germany on that day , on that evening ; Mm - hmm , ; mm - hmm .
Bro014_323	%--	So it 's , ; uh , ; Hmm . ; But it does seem like
Bro018_74	s	Yeah , ; and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that . ; No , ; I don't use that
Bmr028_1555	b	Yep . ; We don't have time , ; we 're not interested , or w whatever ; Hmm .
Bed003_1104	b	Yeah . ; so . ; We could manipulate the source itself ? ; Yeah .
Bmr005_631	s	Oh , I see . ; in in in in the fin in in the forty - five minutes . ; So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , ; but you have you have time uh , uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .
Bmr003_2010	s	Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later . ; That 's right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's the early on .
Bro017_1190	ar	Yeah . ; Do we have a mailing list that includes uh the OGI people ? ; Yeah . ; Uh no .
Bro004_687	s	And using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . ; Right . ; Right . ; And Pratibha did something different is
Btr001_2549	ar	and he said , " Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so " ; and then she said , " Well , no , ; sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ? " ; and he says " Well , no ,
Bro019_1410	bk	Yeah . ; Um , ; By by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at . ; Yeah .
Bed013_81	s	And once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself . ; And answer , ; understand the answer , ; ask something else ,
Bmr008_1212	s	So you 're football league was a good one . ; So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of uh , power , responsibility . ; I guess husband - wife is yet another one . ; And so , you know , in discourse analysis you get things like @ @ the role .
Bed011_836	qh	But , Then again , this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes . ; But well , this is my first guess , ; I mean y ; in much the same way as how how d you know should the route be ?
Bmr016_738	s	OK . ; Yeah I 'm working on it . ; and @ @ we 'll move on . ; I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too .
Bro005_522	s	It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . ; i ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's again better .
Bed005_1002	%--	Like , let 's just look at the case when , um , this is actually the the final action , right ? ; So this is like , uh , you know , touch , ; Y ; or
Bed015_769	b	So , sort of I 'm still working it out . ; But it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I couldn't think of a good way to say " here are the possible things that you could focus on " , ; cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus . ; Mmm .
Bro027_1569	s	uh ; After the b after the noise compensation , n I was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . ; So that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . ; And if it is n if it is close to zero , which is So it 's like a scale @ @ probability value .
Bed015_2162	2	in that you th you throw everything into a pot ; and you try to come up with the , uh ; Except there 's no no theorem prover involved . ; Best explanation .
Btr002_826	%--	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Oh yeah . Yeah . ; So you just want it to go back ,
Bmr003_980	s	We didn't finish the the part of work already completed on this , ; If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? ; did we ? ; I mean , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions ,
Bmr020_872	b	um ; I haven't I haven't listened to it yet , ; but it sounded very good ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_702	s	It 's not really circuit - switched . ; In UMTS you have always GPS as a a involvement in the core network . ; You have , in principle , the path which still is available for for the GSM network . ; Also they use , in principle , the same uh the same mechanism .
Bns003_323	%--	a few sentences will be nice , ; and ; yeah , it depends on how much time you have . ; And then the page for inf about
Bed004_486	%--	and uh ; Alright , well , le let me think about this some more , ; and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them . ; I mean , ultimately we we may w w
Bro026_711	aa	OK . ; It 's , uh It 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . ; I see . ; Yeah ,
Bmr019_564	aap	And aren't these pretty bad microphones ? ; Yep . ; I mean ; Well , they 're bad .
Bro023_1431	b	Yeah . ; I mean the transmission over over the air interface is like a buffer . ; Twenty frame ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1309	ba	you know . You could . ; or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um have them do the digits , or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do . ; We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to . ; Then , having the data is very valuable ,
Bns003_548	no	Is it another thing we have to ? ; Yep . ; So it 's just a su suggestion ; I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that .
Buw001_473	qh	Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes . ; So what we 'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so the question is " is there such a person ? "
Bed006_537	s	mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was completely flabbergasted here
Bmr008_1426	aa	OK . ; OK . ; Th ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1411	2	and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference , ; Present . ; Yep . ; Do a trip report .
Bmr001_736	b	so we should try to do it internally , ; maybe ask ask Jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody ; Mm - hmm ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_1275	%--	Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour . ; OK . ; So . ; If
Bed008_394	s	Accessibility . ; no , accessibility meant ; If it 's closed one probably won't enter . ; Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,
Bed015_184	qw	So that that 's why That 's why I 'll stick with it . ; But ; So ; Well , you know what ?
Bed010_293	s	um , I know that they enjoyed it here , ; and they r they they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , ; what what we have been thinking about , ; and they 're more than willing to to um , cooperate , by all means .
Bmr005_159	s	I you know , I I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them . ; Uh - huh . ; This this one really does um m make you leap from ; So he said , you know , " we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling " .
Bro026_465	s	that 's ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And there is also the idea of using TRAPS , maybe , for the VAD ,
Bro023_461	s	this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it . ; And , ; so , ; uh , I ran this stuff with one more stage of Wiener filtering on it
Bro014_861	%--	and for voiced portion the mean is O point fifty - nine . ; But the variance seem quite high . ; How do you know ? ; So
Bmr002_1433	s	I 've been trying to rotate it through . ; So , Dan will get it next time . ; Are these more expensive or less expensive than this kind ? ; They 're much more expensive .
Bmr026_240	b	But I definitely will do that . ; So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this ; Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1601	fa	Sure . ; but I 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . ; I 've no desire to to make it up , ; but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on .
Bmr031_359	%--	Yeah . ; Um , but otherwise just , you know , stop that ; and just take whatever comes from the other places , ; which ,
Bmr008_1317	s	because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah , yeah yeah . ; I I found the error , and I repeated the experiments
Bmr015_519	%--	So that means , uh , instead of calling it " MR one " , " MR two " , you 'd call it " MRM zero zero one " , ; " MRM zero zero two " , things like that . ; Just so that they 're they 're all the same length . ; But , you know , when you , do things like that you can always
Buw001_945	g	in one sense or another . ; Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do . ; And so we try it out and see how it works . ; Right .
Bmr024_362	s	We could use the tools I 've already developed and transcribe it . ; Hire some people , or use the transcribers to do it . ; We could let IBM transcribe it . ; You know , they 're doing it anyway ,
Bed010_21	x	OK . ; OK . ; So uh , ; It doesn't know " I " .
Bmr026_1212	b	Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? ; Vast majority is from the input unit . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1433	b	but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob ; I mean , discriminative things are good . ; LDA , neural nets , they 're good . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1286	aa	I think so , yeah . ; It 's it 's cl e is is it clear what he wants to compute ? ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1365	s	Are there any questions ? ; Oh , you are welcome . ; Maybe we have also the time to discuss with Miguel off - line the things if there is some uh question concerning uh his talk or maybe other questions . ; Maybe one last question from my side
Bmr005_1482	co	But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , ; so we should think about trying to wrap up here .
Bro026_968	s	So the question is , how far down ? ; right ? ; And ; We could stop at words , but we don't ,
Bmr003_775	bk	See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay , ; and and so when you by the time you click it it 'll be right on because it 'll go back in time to put the ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1600	s	I am not a total expert for for the future wireless networks . ; OK . ; Then I would like to thanks everybody ; and if there 's no additional question , comment , or or other remarks , I would like to start with reading uh these numbers .
Bmr019_1114	s	Yes . ; Oh ! ; Oh . ; And that 's I mean , I I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff ,
Bmr002_1382	b	OK . ; I see . ; So . ; Interesting .
Bro024_1107	s	Yeah , ; we have to take ; Wait a minute . ; I think I 'm confused .
Bmr028_955	g	Yeah . ; Yeah . Because you can get a number uh , for that with the other as well . ; Uh . Right . ; Right ?
Bmr023_271	s	to to put those in there when they 're transcribing . ; So , um , we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting , ; uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation . ; Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file .
Bmr020_401	%--	but you know . ; Hmm . ; Um , now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this . ; We just took the old
Bmr025_629	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The expanded files and things like that . ; OK .
Bmr018_198	qw	And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try . ; I think they 're coming ; OK . ; What would be a good number of minutes ?
Bmr016_154	qy	OK . ; and then go back to digits for awhile , ; or um . ; Do yo I mean , do you want do you want this Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ?
Bmr011_1114	cc	Yeah . ; But , ; uh , it 's just an unknown right now . ; Yeah . I I need to to write to him .
Bed011_1054	s	right . ; And I I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer , ; Yeah . ; but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like ,
Bmr013_277	%--	Place . ; Yeah . ; Place . ; Thank you , what whatev whatever I s said , that 's
Bdb001_607	bk	But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , um , say , an utterance and the words within it ? ; So how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance ? ; Um , you would have another structure lower down than this that would be saying they 're all belonging to this ID . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1569	b	and ; But , I mean , it 's still It 's still cool . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro016_581	s	at least . ; Mmm . ; What kind of information do you mean ? ; Well , I was thinking about things like , you know , gender , uh you know , gender - specific nets and , uh , vocal tract length normalization .
Bed003_446	bk	So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , ; Which is th Which one ? ; but ; OK .
Bmr018_236	aa	OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting , ; and then and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed . ; And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ? ; Right .
Bed002_1176	qw	Um , ; it 's , uh ; It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally . ; What 's the time frame for this ?
Bro019_249	s	you can say " run command " and your HTK thing ; and it 'll find another machine , ; the fastest currently available machine ; and and run your job there .
Btr001_1793	%--	Yeah . ; I 'd fix that too . ; Yeah . ; Do you find
Bmr016_572	s	and pointing out some main conclusions ; like it 's not the speaking style that differs , ; it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . ; And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors ,
Bmr021_855	b	um ; You know , the number of um ; You know , this front - end u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_610	s	Alright ! ; So . ; Cool ! ; I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .
Bns001_947	s	KPN interests ? ; Because , I believe s if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the Multicast stuff , and KPN is very interesting in UMTS stuff , and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on , but only for the uh IP - layer technology , then , why do the mapping of multica also potential mapping of Multicast , I think , must be of major interest for them . ; Right ? ; One question .
Bed002_914	d	Spelled FEY . ; Do you do you ; Oh , Fey Parrill . ; You know her ?
Bmr010_348	s	Meeting Recorder . ; Oh , you did ? ; You saw that ? ; OK . So you probably did get that .
Bmr024_914	s	They 're on CD , but they 're not tha that 's not the only source . ; Like ; They have them on disk . ; And they burn new ones every once in a while .
Bed008_1158	2	like for example consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift ; Right . ; so even ; Those are not necessarily binary .
Bro018_972	s	You can You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so ; and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification at all . ; Another thing I was thinking about was um is there a ; I was wondering if there 's maybe um certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum .
Bed002_737	b	i it was mobile ; but not not with a w a real wizard system . ; So there were never answers . ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_298	s	also , um , ; I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , ; but I thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . ; Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations .
Bed006_1482	qw	um ; In principle what I I think that this approach does , ; and e e whether or not we take the Enter - View and we all throw up up the ladder ; um wha how do how does Professor Peter call that ?
Buw001_512	%--	By hand . ; but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it ; Or , d o ; and how
Bed003_656	s	Yeah . ; Yeah ; but it it ; Maybe the bias toward " Tango " ing was yours , then ?
Bed002_222	co	focus on that object down ; Oh , I can actually walk with this . ; This is nice . ; down here .
Bro013_759	bk	Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the " O " . ; But people wouldn't know what that wa ; I mean there is no convention for it . ; OK .
Btr002_1785	s	someone in one of these EDU meetings , they have a laptop ; and they hit the thing ; and the and there 's an error screen that comes up ; and it has this " doink " kind of sound .
Bmr003_1010	s	they do a first - pass speech recognition . ; And then they they do a clean up . ; But it 's gonna be horrible . ; They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this .
Bro023_1714	s	Actually what I observed is that for Italian it doesn't seem Th - there seems to be a problem . ; No . ; Well . ; So , it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one .
Bmr016_407	s	but then you don't get the the same effects . ; Yeah . ; Well , what I mean is actually no not the overlaps that are well - governed linguistically , ; but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people
Bsr001_1013	s	Hmm . ; I mean , could be reassuring , ; Yeah . ; High involvement .
Bro010_176	s	plus plus the frames , ; but it 's OK . ; What 's the allowable ? ; Two - fifty ,
Bed016_850	bk	OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week . ; but . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_31	bk	Is this ; Yeah . ; Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live . ; OK .
Bmr012_621	s	it 's a meeting , ; it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes ; but uh ; yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could ,
Bro004_593	s	Can I ask something real quick ? ; In in the upper part in the English stuff , it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? ; and that 's in the uh the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA , ; sort of the middle column ?
Bed016_682	br	I mean wh ; We don't need the words to that . ; Pro - probably not your marks in the kitchen , today . ; What ?
Bed004_78	b	They are gonna get more comfortable headsets . ; They already ordered them . ; OK . ; Uh
Bed003_766	b	I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually ; We were thi ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_613	s	It depends on what you 're after , of course , ; but It seems like that would be more a case of the control condition , compared to , uh an experimental condition , with more than two . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , Liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there ,
Bed015_1275	b	let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . ; OK . ; OK , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1370	b	The different zone . ; uh , I I don't know . ; So , uh , from from these charts , are ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1338	s	I forget . ; But there 's a town . ; Oh . ; in in there .
Bro026_389	qw	Do we explicitly downsample ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And what if we didn't do that ?
Bro017_261	bk	But you have many of those vectors per phoneme , ; Well , so you get many decisions . ; right ? ; Uh - huh .
Bro012_108	s	an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; You know . ; i i Some things are going to be hurt .
Bed003_688	ba	They refer to your current task . ; Like like current thing you want to do at this moment . ; Um . Yeah , ; well That 's that 's an interesting point .
Bmr012_1033	aa	Wow . ; For for each ? ; I mean the tuner is four thirty for each . ; Yep .
Bsr001_2403	s	Cool . ; No , that 's a really good idea ; to have some standard ; I mean , especially if a the different sites can do something like that .
Btr002_3054	ba	Right . ; OK ; That 's OK . ; It 's alright .
Bed002_841	%--	So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the for themselves ; Yeah . ; b y ; You don't
Bro003_597	b	Oh . ; when really they 're both silence . ; I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six . ; OK .
Bro021_1090	s	That 's true . ; That 's true . ; OK . ; But this this is correct ?
Bmr006_709	cc	Darn ! ; I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . ; Now , eh , I need ehm , to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly . ; I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas .
Btr001_1032	s	You know , what 's On that sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is you can have a pronunciation of of the word " a " as " a " . ; Huh . ; Yeah . ; And then you can have " uh " like a pause or whatever as " uh " ,
Bed002_599	s	Yep . ; So , they 're they 're quite distinct . ; I mean , you need them both , ; but they 're quite distinct .
Bro019_740	s	Well ; Right . ; So , I mean , ; yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched ,
Bmr006_1092	%--	Yeah . ; I 've got a question . ; Interesting . ; This
Bmr025_83	aa	We 're sort of doing things in parallel , ; that way we can get as much done a at once . ; Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , ; Yeah .
Bro015_203	s	Mmm . ; I don't know . ; So um you know there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did . ; Um . But it varied a little bit .
Buw001_2156	s	OK . ; But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields . ; Mark 's aware of those , too . ; " Hey , look what we found ! "
Bmr010_1215	%	where that i if that 's something that we wanna do with each meeting , ; sort of like a , um ; it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_626	%--	how are you gonna g get this information . ; Um , ; and that 's so , getting back to here , ; uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we don't want all the com
Bro005_583	s	That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , ; that if you change um , change what they are ; Hmm . ; It 's diagonal covariance matrices ,
Bmr008_1669	aa	Yeah . ; I think also the harmonics would be very important . ; So if you can find voiced regions and ; Yes .
Bed005_1128	%--	Um The so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions . ; Right . ; And , um In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , um , manually , uh , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ? ; Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent
Buw001_864	qw	Right ? ; Well ; In in our real - life setting . ; What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ?
Bro025_469	b	and then finally drop the frames after the neural net . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_485	b	And that 's it . ; And that 's partly to pick up ; And then we have another form later down which is um , list other language influences . ; Yeah .
Bed002_764	b	But , you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model . ; So , to Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1282	s	not the the choices of " where is X " or " how do I get to X " . ; Just " where is X " . ; Yeah . ; Just just " where is X " .
Bro024_1083	b	So they don't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error . ; Oh , OK . ; So they changed the whole thing so that there 's no delay for that compression and part also . ; Hmm .
Bmr031_1239	s	Um , we fixed up our different , uh , transcripts with different types of , uh , annotations ; and we re re - ran ali re - ran alignments . ; And we 're gonna develop a new feature database based on those alignments ; and do some trees and analysis .
Bed002_777	qw	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment . ; How exactly does the data collection work ?
Bro007_225	no	I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten . ; So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ? ; Uh ; I don't remember .
Bed003_216	%--	Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . ; If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped . ; I don't know belief - nets very well . ; Well usually , I mean , you know , N
Bed003_1443	b	So , works . ; Um , even though there is probably no train from here to New York , ; right ? ; Mmm .
Bmr015_588	%--	Um , since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how how are the transcriptions going ? ; Yeah . ; The the news is that I 've I uh ; s So in s um
Bed005_1123	qw	Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard . ; OK . ; And Uh ; One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? "
Buw001_2183	aa	Just wanted to know . ; So , seems like we 're winding down . ; Right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_712	s	I mean , we 're gonna have an example case ; um , right ? ; I m the the point is to like this " where is " case , or something . ; Yeah , maybe you have It would be kind of The paper ha would have , in my vision , a nice flow if we could say , well here is th the th here is parsing if you wanna do it c right ,
Bmr006_199	s	Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . ; And ; Right . ; because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards .
Bro027_1561	b	Does something . ; It doesn't work as well . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_38	ba	Were we gonna do digits ? ; OK . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? ; I think that ; It 's a good idea .
Bmr028_521	s	That 's all I have . ; You wanna talk about recognition ? ; Chuck , you wanna talk about recognition ? ; I haven't done anything .
Bro028_65	qy	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Was Hari on the on the phone ?
Bmr026_346	b	Well , is there ; Why not just hang them off of Abbott , ; is there a ; Yeah .
Bro027_475	h	but the problem is still that the latency is too large . ; What 's the latency ? ; Because ; um
Bro007_94	qw	then we could compare the two and say what was better . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Um and how does this compare to the numbers
Bmr031_785	s	Especially Hawaii . ; Yeah . There 's a there 's a they really need it in Novosibirsk . ; Yeah , right . ; Th - that only takes a day or so .
Bed003_165	d	Exactly . ; OK . ; Hmm . ; Robert ?
Bro010_493	b	A little bit more ; and ; Or or less , ; Yeah .
Bed006_801	%--	right ? ; Yeah . ; The S Action - schemas basically have extra ; See we so those are schemas exist
Bmr016_799	bk	OK . ; and it will give you his ID . ; Great , great . ; OK .
Bed002_1323	s	Do you wanna see a picture ? ; Sure ! ; Sure ! ; Have to reboot for that though .
Bmr009_1311	s	And and I think that that 's the best way to do it , ; because because of the problems we 're talking about ; but what we said last week , was no , put in a list , ; so I put in a list .
Btr001_319	s	because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of ; Mm - hmm . ; actually she she was in the middle phase I would say . ; We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult .
Bed010_533	bk	how much is that used in German ? ; Um . The uh Well I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack . ; I mean , the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment , ; Oh , OK .
Bmr013_1039	s	You bet . You bet . ; And they work very well . ; Yes . ; So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings .
Bro025_600	s	Just the cepstra . ; Yeah . ; PLP features computed on noisy speech . ; But there is no nothing particularly robust in these features .
Bns003_128	s	That 's all . ; And But currently it 's not working , right ? ; Right , ; um On Friday when I installed , um uh Linux the first time I got access to the local network here , um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI .
Bro025_386	s	So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better
Bmr002_1313	s	So , I mean , I I think it c there 's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input . ; Yeah . ; Cuz when you listen to a sentence , you can tell If it 's contrastive stress ; you say " Oh ! that word was stressed "
Btr002_3371	b	OK . But for , like , noise that we know is something like mike noise , or something like a door , whatever , then we can mark it as that ; Hmm ! ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_491	s	Well it ; Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . ; Ooo . ; I mean they 're on th right , these ,
Bmr014_408	%--	and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it . ; Oh so you already have that , ; OK . ; Well that 's that 's a way that 's
Bro008_138	b	But some people have done exactly that sort of thing , ; of of and the I mean it 's not To to look in speech only , to try to m to measure these things during speech , ; Yeah , ; yeah .
Bed010_8	s	Good . ; Yeah . ; OK so , let 's get started . ; Nancy said she 's coming
Bmr018_1491	s	I mean , the missing thi ; so so what they were saying it 's one of these things is you know , all you need is more data , sort of ; But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , uh , improperly , ; I mean , it was a nice study .
Bro005_897	s	Yeah . ; Results are only coming for for this net . ; Mmm . ; OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ .
Bed009_816	br	yeah ; that 's In this direction , ; yes ; What ?
Bsr001_1854	b	Yeah . ; I think that would be excellent . ; And , uh , it will really help the design too . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_576	s	OK . ; And then there 's delta besides that ? ; So this is the features that are used by our network ; and then afterwards , you have to compute the delta on the , uh , main feature stream ,
Bro016_482	2	OGI does did that . ; Um . ; At some point they did that for for the voice activity detector . ; Uh , for a v VAD .
Bro025_282	%--	How how much latency does the , uh does our VAD add ? ; Is it significant , ; Uh , right now it 's , um , a neural net with nine frames . ; or ?
Bro017_280	bk	Are they adjacent , ; or are they s ; Adjacent , adjacent . ; OK .
Bns003_445	s	And , um , that means , uh , the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages . ; He has access to the N S A pages . ; And , um , ; but I think that 's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general , on the highest level .
Bed005_855	no	M ; Right . Cuz for a while we were thinking , " well , how can we change the , um , data to sort of illicit tha illicit , um , actions that are more like what we are used to ? " ; But obviously we would rather , you know , try to figure out what 's what 's , you know ; Well , I don't know .
Bro023_1492	b	I mean , if channel one VAD gives you ; f ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_248	b	Mm - hmm . ; And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_655	bk	right ? ; So if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece , you know , there 'd better be some something . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1736	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; It Well , it 's communicative .
Bro018_833	b	but uh , you know , the the models would be all messed up . ; So I was going through and just double - checking that kind of think first , to see if there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bmr022_611	s	Right . ; Otherwise you just count up the total number of beeps . ; And we can do that with wordcount . ; Right ? We already know that that we 're three short .
Bro007_215	s	It 's significantly worse ; it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse . ; Exc - except for the HM ; For many a mismatch it 's worse .
Bmr020_900	ba	Yes . ; Clever . ; Yeah . ; Excellent .
Bro024_1513	bk	Right at the point where you 've done the subtraction . ; OK . ; Um , essentially you 're adding a constant into everything . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_897	s	depends on T , ; w o ; but b all of this is just you just mean ; Yeah . It 's the same .
Bro027_113	s	Yeah . ; I t I think I 've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same , or slightly worse . ; On what test set ? ; On the same , uh , SpeechDat - Car ,
Bmr016_1323	aa	all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today . ; So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check ; That that 's known as " found data " . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr008_1780	b	Yep . ; I don't know ; but eh I I solved the problem with eh a similar way and I haven't problem ; Yeah , Yeah .
Bed006_661	s	nuh ? ; Right . ; definition . ; The idea is , so , imagine we have a library of schema
Bed010_601	s	I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o ; You know , like , " in front of the car " could you know Like , ; here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . ; I could see that ,
Bed005_1465	%--	but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I don't think I mean , the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that
Bns001_1799	bk	uh switch off , ; Don't switch it off . ; Do not Don't switch it off . ; OK ,
Bed014_147	%	That 's the LISP - type scheme . ; She knows how to program in Scheme ? ; I hope ? ; No , I
Bmr025_121	s	Mm - hmm . ; but it does mean you need to be running a web server . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so it it 's pretty big and complex .
Bdb001_392	s	And so I wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way ; and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly . ; Um , ; it doesn't have to be pretty ,
Bmr010_153	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so I did two mixtures , one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers . ; And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet , ; I did that for for five minutes of one dialogue
Bro014_1085	s	and ; Yeah . ; But ; No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies .
Bmr001_784	s	And Yeah . ; As much work as you want . ; Yeah But uh I don't know . ; This meeting , so , say it 's maybe going to be a half hour or something ,
Bro005_534	s	And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , doesn't work ; Yeah . ; uh , well , work , ; but is better , the second configuration .
Bed013_273	s	Here in the group ? ; J J Jer - Jerj ; Jerry Feldman . ; Oh , yeah . That 's the guy .
Bed003_1081	b	Right . ; So you 'd have to like figure out Like you have to go and ; The layout of the table . ; Yeah .
Bro028_1085	s	and fast things and slow things and and so forth . ; So . ; So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at . ; But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what he , uh , came here with
Bns002_1485	bk	and of course everybody has little bit other work to do ; but it should be should be always an ongoing process until I will leave until the tenth of December . ; You mentioned um six partners of this um work . ; OK .
Bro023_150	%--	s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is , " does it matter what models you use ? ; Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , um , tra doing the training data ? " ; Right . ; But I mean the other thing is that that 's
Bed010_27	s	Oh , ; Am Spartacus . " ; " I am Sm - I am Smarticus " is what it 's saying . ; Verstehe .
Bro028_386	bs	i if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good . ; Yeah . ; Uh , and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve . ; So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis
Bed015_1036	s	where here was various information . ; And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . ; So " Harry walked into the room " , ; " Harry " and " room " ,
Bmr027_1292	s	Oh , oh . OK . ; On ; Yeah . ; Once they come in . Sure .
Bed010_810	b	And he he always talks about these ; He he already well ; i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces . ; Yeah .
Bro028_499	s	Good . ; Um , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can talk a little about the status with the , uh , Wall Street Journal things for it . ; So I 've , um , downloaded , uh , a couple of things from Mississippi State . ; Um , one is their software
Btr002_113	s	I did check the example . ; And , um , ; well , and this this would be consistent . ; So , uh , it was transcribed as " with H " ,
Bmr023_1114	b	So that 's that 's another ; So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_108	h	They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so . ; Oh , OK . ; That 's good . ; So
Bro014_381	%--	and and and say here 's how much you , uh you improve the , uh the the relatively clean case ; and here 's ; or or well - matched case , ; and here 's how here 's how much you ,
Bmr006_1296	fa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The - the Oh , I 'm sorry ,
Bmr028_422	s	Yeah ! ; searcher . ; That 's actually Well , it 's useful . ; And it demonstrates why it doesn't work ,
Btr001_1587	b	but usually it 's like , punctuation and capitalization and other things that I 'm end up changing . ; And time bin corrections and things , ; And time bins , ; yeah .
Bro017_481	b	Yes . ; But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be . ; Similar , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2425	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Mmm . ; The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich ,
Bro008_279	s	It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , ; or Uh um ; And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on . ; So it 's not final even if they declared a standard .
Bed002_906	s	OK ? ; So . Uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff ; Uh - huh . ; and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard .
Bed005_49	%--	Meaning , um , kid children 's gymnastic classes , ; pre - school parents and so forth . ; They also sometimes have flexible schedules . ; So , if you happen to be sort of in a non - student social setting ,
Bed010_987	s	It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . ; S so , we 'll see . ; And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it ; and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,
Bro025_193	%--	But just conceptually , where does the neural net go ? ; Do do you wanna h run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted ? ; Mmm . ; Well , depending on its size
Bmr014_683	s	I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ? ; and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " . ; I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . ; And then they 'd hand it back to you .
Bro013_555	s	Yeah because when did noise clear in these section is clear ; Uh . ; Mm - hmm . ; if s @ @ val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values
Bmr005_549	s	isn't it , ; over the whole meeting . ; Yep . ; So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .
Bmr022_303	qw	Yeah . ; See what he thinks would work best with them . ; I mean , what 's going wrong on the other end ? ; What are they doing ?
Bsr001_662	b	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1156	s	Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; We o o ; It 's I met someone at the bakery you know in the Victoria Station t you know train station London before ,
Bro014_1195	2	does does the periodicity of this signal say something about the the ; Fifteen p ; So it 's ; Pitch .
Btr001_1333	bk	So you didn't get one ? ; Oh , interesting . ; No . I 'm glad I didn't . ; OK .
Bmr006_928	s	And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data ; Supervised clustering . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is the the eh , first idea
Bed006_1782	%--	It 's it 's rad , ; yeah . ; And intentions will be " RID " ? ; Like ,
Bns001_607	bk	Ah ! ; And then from Nokia I came to this that project , ; Ah ! ; OK ,
Bmr023_790	s	You know , each each mixture has ten Gaussians ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . We 're using sixty - four , ; and and we 're using sixty - four ,
Bsr001_1032	s	and would be great to com to to basically take advantage of that to to make a synergy more than an overlap , and , you know , help each other . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I I believe each group has , you know , depths in in different , uh , areas ,
Bmr016_1800	b	Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously . ; It 's just disturbing . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro014_341	%--	and other people think that it 's more important to improve a lot on the mismatch ; and ; It sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is gonna be . ; So , bu
Bmr002_1418	bk	But uh ; Yeah . ; I don't feel like you 're speaking unnaturally quietly . ; Oh good .
Bed010_54	%	so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . ; Basically , it just means " build the tree . " ; And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module . ; OK .
Btr002_2175	ba	but for other things , maybe ? ; Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind . ; Mmm - hmm . ; Oh , interesting .
Bed015_137	s	in which case you could just indicate " here I mean the meaningful for some reason " . ; Right ? ; Or Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , " George and Jerry walk into the room in that order " . ; So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form .
Bed011_1024	s	Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . ; I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from sort of as general as argument structure constructions . ; Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . ; I have to do uh uh unbounded dependencies ,
Bmr019_447	ba	Right . ; Right . ; I already tried to get it close . ; Good .
Bmr016_375	%--	and then um , we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield , ; and at some point when we feel it 's mature and we understand what 's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield . ; So . ; The only thing that we don't have ,
Bmr008_135	cc	Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that . ; You need to know sort of Bas - in in this meeting , sort of what is your social status ? ; That 's a separate question . ; So , we 'll We 'll get to that in a moment .
Bmr022_616	s	And so if we just did spee uh beep and non - beep all you would get is that you have three mistakes , ; but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong . ; Right . ; You need some of the words in there , so that you can say " well , this segment matches this one ,
Bmr014_974	s	I 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . ; Cuz I think if they feel that uh , it 's I th I th ; You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , ; um , but but they might be able to argue " oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down " .
Bmr005_569	aa	Mm - hmm . ; it 's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process ; because eh it 's confused with with noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1449	bk	Shirts . ; So if if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . ; But if if he 's not , that 's great too . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1132	aa	Great . OK . ; Yeah . Simspec may need we may n need to re - name that . ; I Yeah . I ; Yeah .
Bro026_431	s	If you do or don't normalize ? ; If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize . ; Right . ; Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize .
Bed006_1471	ba	right ? ; And ; OK . ; Be great .
Bro017_1103	s	Huh ! ; Well that 's that 's a really i ; So . So . Yeah . ; That wouldn't be too difficult to try .
Btr002_3002	s	they do this thing . ; I shouldn't do that so often . ; I 'm sorry about that . ; They do this sound ,
Btr001_1802	aa	You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe ? ; Yeah . ; Oh . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1314	%--	Yeah . ; No . ; It 's not . ; It 's it was trained on some alignment obtained
Bns001_861	s	and I believe there 's a lot of contacts . ; Or there could be a lot of contacts uh with with these people . ; Especially at uh Georgia Tech . ; I know on next week on Tuesday .
Bed017_455	ba	Um . ; What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this ; because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , ; so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model .
Bro017_553	aa	But maybe I I mean we are not too far from from fifty percent , from the new baseline . ; Uh , but not ; Which would mean like sixty percent over the current baseline , which is ; Yeah .
Buw001_1877	s	Oh ! ; some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , that was uh , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , uh , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about .
Bro010_1062	g	You can look at stress . ; Mm - hmm . ; But stress doesn't , uh , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , ; right ?
Bro022_716	%--	It 'd be a lot of work . ; That 's the only thing . ; Yeah . ; It 's
Bro005_638	s	and about multi - band , ; uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , ; um ; mmh Actually , I w I w hhh prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium .
Bed013_105	aap	Well then , he probably should be coming back a year from now . ; Yeah , I w ; See the the generation bit , making the system generate generate something , is shouldn't be too hard . ; Well , once the system understands things .
Bmr022_700	s	OK . ; Yep . ; I also looked thr over the text ; and I was impressed by the accuracy ,
Bmr031_1277	b	um , we just , um we just had a phone call with Mari and her students , in fact , ; and they want to , um , e m They 're bringing up their own meeting recognizer , ; which is based on Bill Byrne 's , uh , recognizer from Johns Hopkins . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_139	aa	Can you repeat what you were saying about the silence probability ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I only ; Yeah .
Bmr012_273	s	There 's the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong ; so ; but ; Um But that shouldn't affect anything
Bmr029_651	s	So ; To keep it the same but j just change them all to channel F ? ; Exactly . So , uh well , you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers . ; That 's the key point .
Bmr006_185	s	but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in um , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing .
Bed015_1057	%--	Um , and then the " status " I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . ; So , th the the big com and and finally " discourse segment " is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , ; like utterance - specific kinds of things . ; So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse
Btr001_440	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and I notice it 's more and more difficult . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_91	s	by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's ; So , uh in order ; I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part . ; Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard
Bro017_912	b	Now your mean of your C - one original data has is four . ; But your model still has a mean of two . ; So even though you 've expended the range , your mean doesn't match anymore . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1518	b	so . ; Oh , yeah , ; better do it different , then . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_285	b	And to hear it . ; Yeah . ; and see the pitch contours also . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_809	s	but I thought ; Oh you mean on the digit form ? ; This is this is rather a low level question , but but it used used to be Date came first . ; Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest .
Bdb001_79	bk	Right , ; right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr005_901	bk	Di - dif different different bandwidth . ; They ; I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers . ; OK .
Bmr025_927	aap	W ; But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , ; doesn't it ? ; Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard .
Bro027_1453	s	So it 's kind of like a combination of the uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . ; It 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination ; but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things . ; And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case .
Bmr031_411	aa	Something like that . ; Oh , so that 's ; Well , you know , we record here at for at forty - eight or something ; And then we downsample . Yep .
Bro005_1412	aa	but ; yeah , we ; Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least ; Yeah , sure .
Btr001_2459	aa	Or how long do you wait after the joke ; To keep going with the meeting . ; to ; Right .
Bmr028_200	s	Yes . ; And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ? ; So , in that case ; No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript .
Bro004_678	b	Yes . ; Yeah . ; Um , but , ; yeah .
Bns003_974	%--	but I think that , eh , any of us could address these things in the future , ; or maybe a new person could address this . in the future . ; So ; if
Btr001_2290	h	Yeah , so s ; is it a shrug ? ; Would you say it 's another shrug ? ; Um ,
Btr002_2715	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; But yes . Yeah , exactly . ; I wouldn't , uh i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put " breath " and we leave it in .
Bro019_791	bk	I don't know . ; Well , it 's both both uh , cases can i ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bro014_932	s	another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ? ; So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference , ; coming up with some things and just trying them out ; and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise ,
Bmr014_502	s	Oh good . ; Good . ; and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . ; And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas .
Bsr001_667	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1236	qy	Uh , I have heard that uh wireless LAN and Bluetooth will have some problems ; uh that they influence each other . ; In front ? ; Do you have additional information about this topic ?
Bro018_956	s	it 's actually been awhile since I 've looked at it . ; Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the RASTA libs and thing like that . ; And I didn't I couldn't see any wh place where that kind of thing was done . ; But um I didn't quite understand everything that I saw ,
Bmr031_971	s	Maybe n end of next week . ; End of next week . ; And is EDU still recording ? ; They usually do Thursdays .
Bro027_236	%--	that one really benefited from the larger set . ; And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth . ; Uh , so , um , ; that , uh that seemed to be
Bmr016_2281	b	So if you b merge two things , then you know that it 's the sum of the transcripts , ; but if you split inside something , you don't where the word which words moved . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1503	b	And you get " mm - hmm " ; and diff everybody 's doing it . ; And just listen to them ? ; Yeah .
Bmr011_54	%	Who 's coming ? ; I think ; Uh , uh , John Fiscus ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1194	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is the methods that say that we 're going obtain this . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_703	s	I 'll have to think about that . ; Hmm . ; I don't know . ; I mean it th I can thi I can think of arguments in either direction on that .
Btr002_1939	%--	he everyone 's talking , ; and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else ; and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before . ; And and what he had done , is he had left the room to g
Bed009_741	%--	I mean have you thought through ? ; Is it an HPSG parser ? ; Is it a whatever ? ; No no it 's uh I think it 's it 's totally complicated for
Bed005_670	%--	We don't know what , entirely . ; Uh , yeah . ; but I 'm just ; But the
Bmr001_215	%--	Well If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then and then later we can uh replace it with
Bro021_1256	%--	Are you saying that all of these estimates are done using , um , estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames ? ; Yeah . ; And never change throughout anything else ? ; Never cha
Bmr013_972	bk	Uh , they said it would take about a week . ; Oh , exciting . K . ; K . ; K .
Bro027_1716	s	So ; I see . ; so the neural ; so that is coming from a separate neural net or some VAD .
Bmr008_316	bk	OK . ; So , let 's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we 'll get over o get over to that one . ; Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe ; OK .
Bed013_930	bk	Discourse . ; Oh , discourse . ; Yeah . ; Discourse is all things linguistic , yeah .
Bmr016_1888	b	and you know I mean it gets kicked out in the spelling , ; Right . ; and it also gets kicked out in the , uh , freq frequency listing . ; Right .
Bed011_26	s	Yeah . ; So , would you like to ; I think so . ; So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side .
Bed011_1159	s	I haven't planned to go . ; Uh , probably we can uh pay for it . ; OK . ; Um a student rate shouldn't be very high .
Bmr030_304	s	Was this code that you downloaded to do this ? ; Or was it ; This was um , Kemal Sonmez at SRI , ; who 's a co - worker with , uh , Liz .
Bro004_744	g	but this is not the case for another kind of data . ; It 's a trade - off , ; So ; right ?
Bro014_787	s	Uh . ; Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay . ; Then we tried , um , to do something like proposal - two ; but having , um , e using also MSG features .
Bmr006_942	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So is it just one cluster per ; A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . ; Right .
Bro013_612	aa	That 's as as a separate thing . ; i ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1289	s	You can line them up based on the times . ; You can ; Yeah . ; So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file , it will actually compare the words based on their time marks .
Bed004_371	s	Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose , ; and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .
Bed014_462	s	Right . ; Well . Uh , what was supposed to happen ? ; I 've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones , ; so , um , you know , I don't have a write - up of or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about
Bed010_686	b	Yeah . ; I see this is this is getting into Ami 's thing . ; Yeah . ; Uh .
Bro024_1081	bk	their their own error correction mechanism . ; Oh . ; So they don't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr031_538	b	I don't know if there were fifty , ; but there were definitely above , like , twenty . ; Whew . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1704	b	but then they decide for whatever reason that they 're not going to . ; But then they don't . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1441	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; J - sound - stat ? OK . ; Minus D , capital D .
Bro014_1137	x	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so if we if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT , we have something that 's close to the excitation signal . ; Oh .
Btr001_1667	b	Well , i it 's a judgment call . ; And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . " ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1618	b	because if it g g gets wiped out or something , y I mean it is backed up on the other disk . ; So , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah ,
Bmr008_1578	b	right ? ; So it 's looking for some periodic behavior , ; and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that . ; Uh - huh .
Bns002_1187	bk	Mm - hmm . ; And ; and Miguel , should I should ask you one question . ; Yeah .
Btr001_533	aa	Especially when they 're when you were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes . ; It 's kind of ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1546	aa	You don't know it . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; So ; Right . Exactly .
Bmr006_398	b	No crunchy food . ; Yeah . ; So Well , it would be lunch afterwards . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_478	s	and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , ; but I 've got a bunch of ; uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth . ; But , um , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones .
Bro017_1088	s	so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , " this plane is uh uh passing " ; then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub . ; And they were calling from the pub . ; And they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore .
Bed012_702	ba	Right . ; Just visiting . ; Vacation . ; It 's a pretty nice place ,
Bro004_1156	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Huh . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2027	ba	Yeah . ; I don't understand . " ; U no . ; Yeah , it 's difficult .
Bro021_323	qw	Yeah . ; Um ; Were you using the the normalization in addition to this ? ; I mean , what was the rest of the system ?
Bmr013_652	%--	OK . ; Different different number of speakers , different speakers , different conditions . ; Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet , ; uh , I mean we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh , couple examples of . But but , uh ,
Bmr019_221	s	Yeah . ; And I asked him and he couldn't tell either . ; Hmm . ; So I just cut it out .
Bro017_1149	b	Uh . ; Exactly . ; And so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_2455	b	Um ; it 's good to know this . ; C what I what I would say is , um , if it 's communicative s beyond just the p mouth opening and the w oh , you know , the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak , then I would like to have it if it 's communicative , I 'd like to have it preserved . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1387	s	and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type . ; So we build a little data structure ; And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V ; And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type
Bmr003_1664	s	But assuming we can get around that somehow . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well you were saying , I think it can read ; It can read and write as many as you want ,
Btr002_3198	s	Right . ; and then they throw in an " er " . ; Oh . ; m and that would be an " er " .
Btr001_1545	ba	I would not be as thorough , ; not be as careful . ; I kinda miss it . ; Excellent .
Bsr001_2119	s	We we we were gonna use the same tool . ; Wow ! ; But what if you had like written the s the Tcl kluge or something , and then both done the same ; We we set up that tool already ,
Bmr010_1517	s	and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator . ; Yeah . ; So ; I I still have a hunch that there 's it 's in there some place ,
Bro010_1179	%--	Mm - hmm . ; There 's also this , uh , um , uh , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , ; so , uh ; we have , uh
Bed002_703	s	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm sure that , you know ; Yeah . ; The No , that 's fine .
Bmr010_440	s	Yeah . ; OK . OK . ; So . ; Oh , we should definitely get with them then ,
Btr002_2151	b	Right . ; gesture , ; whatever . ; Right .
Bro005_780	s	uh , i if if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . ; I mean , you 're gonna do what you 're gonna do ; Mmm . ; but but my my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find .
Bmr011_1048	s	Yeah . ; And aft after a minute or so it 's it 's way better . ; So ; So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments .
Bmr018_1562	ar	Yeah . ; It 's just no ; But ; No , but there was still a spread .
Bed011_529	b	right ? ; Yeah . ; So we yeah we don't know how many we can get next door at the uh shelter for example . ; Hmm .
Bro026_453	s	We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out . ; Yeah . ; So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on . ; It 's depending on the same data as the other .
Bed004_145	s	Well , if we we um ; So , are are you trying to record this meeting ? ; There was a strange reflex . ; I have a headache .
Bed011_635	s	Yep . ; He 'll be there for two weeks . ; He is going to uh ; He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around
Bmr027_506	%--	So , um , ; I think that if you f i if we send the email as you have ; and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people ; and hand it to , uh
Bro026_345	aa	Oh , are we ? ; So ; I It is a triumph . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1318	s	So if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that 's a little bit aligned , ; that there 's some transparency concerning the results ; and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace . ; So that 's the basic idea .
Bmr002_828	s	so you have It either means uh " himself " or it means " even " ; and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , they have the recordings such that they can locate things uh with by searching for part of speech and also intonational tags .
Bed009_907	h	of course we l actually only looked at the English . ; It ; Did we look at the German ? ; um
Bro024_263	bk	Or ? ; Oh , well , no . ; I guess not . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_645	co	Yeah . ; Basically . ; No that 's not a problem . ; I L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these these purposes that we have , and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space ,
Bmr012_614	s	This i ; as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps ; yeah . ; This is not that good .
Bro027_1808	b	Uh , yeah . ; or , I mean , different among classes . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1051	b	Yeah . I think that I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time . ; I don't know . ; At ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1020	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But one thing we could do is ; Let let me let me just ask you something .
Bmr008_1157	b	Right , but that example was not ; That 's true . That 's true . ; Right , so my example was not a good one , because that 's ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1271	bk	No . ; Is zero OK ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr029_797	bk	And it shouldn it shouldn't take that long to do . ; Mmm . OK . ; Right . ; OK .
Bro004_1151	b	Yeah . ; it stretches again . ; For single frames I think it would be pretty hard . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_107	b	Mmm . ; So , six is , uh two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah .
Bmr023_770	b	Deletions ? ; So , you , uh So , actually it it preferred to have a positive er , negative insertion penalty , ; which means that , um ; Uh - huh .
Bmr007_1300	s	And , no actually , you can't . ; Yeah . ; Does it take ; Actually actually I I thought that 's what you were giving us was another meeting and I was like , " Oh , OK ! "
Bns003_621	s	Yes . ; Absolutely . ; And , if they are interested in uh , a certain kind of project then it must be related to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing with respect to UMTS , ; I it It will be different thing .
Bsr001_363	s	Yeah . ; It 's kind of , uh , ; and . ; I mean ,
Bed005_1275	%--	Absolutely . ; OK . ; Uh , or , link to ; or
Bro017_150	b	Yeah , ; that 's what that 's a g very good uh point , ; because David says " well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_552	s	No . ; But , I think I think that it it ; it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on Italian , uh , data and then , uh , we tested on Danish data and it did terribly , uh , that that it would look bad . ; And I think someone would notice
Bmr008_528	s	Hmm . ; so . ; Yeah . ; I haven't seen what what they did in TIMIT .
Bmr003_1234	aa	but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . ; Yeah , ; out of out of Adam 's pocket . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1270	b	Exactly . ; Exactly , ; I 'm glad you ; Yeah .
Bro026_75	b	I don't s I didn't set up You can also set up a CVS server on a new port . ; It 's like well uh , a main server , or d You can do a CVS server . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed006_34	%--	OK . ; Getting ahead of myself . ; So . ; Um . For those who don't know
Bmr008_907	s	Yeah . ; And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize ; and this will be a form a place for us to connect the two . ; And then the meetings that they attended ,
Bmr018_227	aa	OK , so . ; Oh , that 's right . ; So the first thing is the automatic thing , ; Right .
Bns001_1008	s	So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection . ; It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML , ; but that 's all what 's uh ; It 's not IP at all .
Bro017_130	s	but maybe we should discuss that . ; And everybody said " oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there " ; and I said " well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . " ; Then they said " oh no no no because uh everybody is invited . "
Buw001_1825	b	He would never use it . ; but it wouldn't have anything to do with the travel . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed016_941	ar	About Plato and the book ? ; No . ; Oh . ; No .
Bro019_1550	%--	And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , ; sometimes they 're not . ; Mmm . ; So it 's it 's it 's a little ,
Bro024_1042	s	Yeah . ; you know ? ; Yeah . ; So if they include the delta , it will be an additional forty millisecond .
Bed009_596	b	You go to th ; but I I I I think it 's really really wrong headed for something that you that has a lot of state , ; it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2106	s	I see . ; But they had multiple mikes ; and they did do recognition , ; and they did do real conversations .
Bdb001_955	%--	the right representation , ; then , i you know , I hope it won't ; We don't actually need the whole full - blown thing to be ready , ; Can you
Bmr018_1002	aa	We wouldn't have to re - do them , ; we would just have to edit them . ; Well , and also , I mean , I still haven't I still haven't given up on forced alignment . ; No , you 're right ,
Bmr001_434	b	How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space ; cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory . ; Yeah . ; I 'm sure .
Bsr001_1014	g	I mean , could be reassuring , ; Yeah . ; High involvement . ; you know ?
Bsr001_1167	%--	but you have to ; Yeah . ; That 's right . ; It 's so funny , like we close the door and it 's
Bns001_948	%--	Because , I believe s if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the Multicast stuff , and KPN is very interesting in UMTS stuff , and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on , but only for the uh IP - layer technology , then , why do the mapping of multica also potential mapping of Multicast , I think , must be of major interest for them . ; Right ? ; One question . ; Yes , but if if it 's available
Bmr021_339	bd	well , actually , the th what you do is you run ; Oh , now I have another use for the ; The way I recently used it , ; and there might be better ways
Bmr011_162	s	so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of ; if this microphone seems OK to people , ; uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . ; Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working .
Bmr027_671	bd	if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time . ; There 's the responding part ; and there 's also what if , ; uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen ,
Bns002_289	b	This one . ; This one , n next slide is ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr013_407	b	Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , ; right . ; They overlap each other in weird ways . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_645	b	so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . ; OK . ; Alright . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_703	aa	Yeah , but um Miguel , if uh in the previous slide you mentioned that you uh are working also on adaptive power control . ; OK ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_418	s	It seems to be helping on the well - matched condition . ; So that 's why this improvement I got from the last result . ; So . And it actually r reduced a little bit on the high mismatch , ; so in the final weightage it 's b b better
Bro003_1583	%--	But wasn't it , uh ; I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch . ; It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or , ; Well , there 's different there , um , there 's
Bmr029_617	bk	Right . ; uh , once we have the new data . ; You have models of short males ? ; Yeah .
Bed011_296	qw	" I have one question I get one response " , ; or should we allow for a certain level of complexity . ; And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references . ; Well , so Keith , what do you think ?
Bed006_666	b	and then we have forced uh motion , ; we have cost action , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1802	aa	you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . ; Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , ; So . ; Yeah .
Bro018_346	%--	Then maybe I can understand . ; uh times the ; Well , this is natural log , ; and maybe it has something to do with the fact that this is
Bmr011_295	s	And , um . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , uh , handle multi - channel recording . ; Oh , I should 've ; I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . ; I forgot to do it .
Btr002_1398	b	and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting ; and then it ends up the end . ; And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_488	s	Yeah . ; S Mm - hmm ; So what does Region mean ; Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing .
Bmr028_1661	qy	It 's your hair . ; Hmm . ; but ; Um , actually , is there a way , though , to use whatever you 're using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on ?
Bed009_1003	s	It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning . ; But let me give you a very short version of this . ; So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning . ; It 's called the " route planner " or something .
Bmr019_1665	b	The ; I have no idea what they 're talking about . ; The , um ; Yeah .
Bro022_876	b	Yeah . ; So having some kind of a ; uh , you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_450	no	uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday ; and , ; yeah , I 'm sorry , ; I don't don't know the answer
Bns002_774	fa	Oh per per hour . ; no sorry ; m Yeah , that 's right . ; Sorry .
Bns002_1048	bk	Yeah . ; Routing ? ; Routing protocols intended for multicast . ; OK . Yeah .
Btr002_2252	s	Yeah . ; Then you hear it . ; Yeah . ; So , th it 's kind of like that .
Bns002_529	bk	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this transmission won't take place . ; OK ,
Bro023_212	%	so you you cache the utterances ? ; That 's how you get your , ; uh ; M
Bmr005_1350	b	And and um d Do you have any idea when when uh the you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ? ; Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_459	b	Right ? ; Well , you could . ; Yeah . I mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr024_1033	aa	Right . ; You just run a program to restore them . ; The o the one that we have ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_784	bk	Yeah , a absolutely . If it 's a nice site . ; Especially Hawaii . ; Yeah . There 's a there 's a they really need it in Novosibirsk . ; Yeah , right .
Bed002_939	b	Mm - hmm . ; And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bed005_1452	s	Mmm . ; cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into ; Ah ! ; But he doesn't remember at least when I talked to him , he didn't remember whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work .
Bro015_8	s	So hopefully he 'll have some intensive time to to work with people . ; Um . The second thing is that um we 're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer . ; So that may or may not happen ; but if he does since actually Pratibha is going to be off at IBM um the uh effort will pretty much shift here ,
Bmr006_371	s	Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so ; Uh but I I think that the uh i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . ; Yep . ; And so , uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , "
Bed011_488	s	But no , they 're I mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know ; tourists maybe a bit different ; Yeah , I guess so . ; and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here .
Bro012_865	bk	And it may help to do the variance . ; but then the second order is is the variances ; OK . ; OK .
Bed015_944	b	finish . ; and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . ; But it 's still is limited possibility . ; Hmm .
Btr001_1838	2	But then there are some people who are Even if they 're not actually speaking , you can tell they 're more involved or interested or something , ; Yeah . ; cuz they 're always , " Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm " Um , reacting . Yeah . ; Reacting .
Bmr006_508	b	I will be here full - time next week . ; Oh , that 's fine . ; OK , see you . ; OK .
Bed005_172	b	The former end g " ; I I also have it running here , ; Oh , I see . ; Uh - huh .
Bed010_1021	b	Oh , so in Switzerland . ; which is uh E P ; F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva . ; Great .
Bmr020_1444	s	Minus D , capital D . ; But ; Yeah . ; but but I I I have another suggestion on that , which is , since , really what this is , is is is trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gonna be this this post - processing step ,
Bmr030_278	s	G Actually could you email me a reference to that paper ? If you have it ? ; Yeah , sure . ; Cuz I 'm sorta curious how what criteria it has . ; I should email Morgan about it too ,
Bro021_592	b	Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions ; I guess you ha haven't had a chance to work with it too much ; about about , uh uh , uh m other ways of taking care of the phase . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_413	s	Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information ; which is more elaborate than " I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . " ; So . ; And I think that I don't need to tell you this .
Bro014_1227	t3	Right ? ; Right . ; And so you just want to find out what the filters are . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1044	aa	And they were loading the full mixed files then , ; Very quickly . ; and it didn't seem to be any problem . ; I agree .
Bns002_601	s	OK . ; If if if I can hear you , you can hear me . ; Mm - hmm . ; and and the opposite works also .
Bro025_366	b	What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that ? ; Well , they 're you know , they 're disputing it . ; You know , they 're saying , uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds . ; Mmm .
Bmr021_65	s	the microphones , as far as ; Um , they 're more directional , ; a little better error uh , noise cancellation , ; and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth , like this ,
Bmr019_689	s	Actually it was better with slightly better or about th ; Right . ; it was the same with tighter pruning . ; So for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better .
Bns001_680	s	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , what is what means quality of service . ; A certain degree .
Bed015_882	b	I mean , because ; Yeah . ; you can just say whatever stuff , " i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever , both , and so forth . " ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .
Bed014_838	b	Yes . ; and , um ; Always good . ; Right .
Bmr029_350	s	Yeah . ; And whether it 's , um ; Uh , I think that 's the o actually ; and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone .
Bmr016_320	s	So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly . ; Mmm , oh , OK . ; Oh OK . ; But I think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits ,
Bro028_849	%--	I uh ; Something like one per frequency band , ; One ; or
Bmr031_1302	s	and then train up the classifiers . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's I guess it 's an undergrad , too , that that 's going to be doing this work .
Bmr018_1352	s	Yeah , I also sat and chatted with several of the NIST folks . ; They seemed like a good group . ; What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ? ; Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings ,
Bmr007_753	2	But you know , they the s the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway , ; Just remembered a joke . ; because you get a sense also of posture . ; What people were wearing .
Bed008_73	s	When we 're yeah when we 're done . ; Hmm . ; So so ; the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when
Bro024_34	s	Um , ; so , yeah , the this past week I 've been main mainly occupied with , um , getting some results , u from the SRI system trained on this short Hub - five training set for the mean subtraction method . ; And , um , ; I ran some tests last night .
Bed006_390	b	OK and the there is a store there . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_685	b	that too . ; It 's a very , very small set , actually . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_1484	ft	Yeah . ; Excellent ! ; Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels . ; Thank you !
Bmr031_1601	bk	You know , uh , uh , X - X X X - X X minus mu over sigma . Yeah . ; You mean just a a Z - square , ; like ? ; Right , right . Right . OK .
Bed012_541	s	right ? ; Cuz , that 's what I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node . ; So , I mean , ; you may not even bother to compute things you don't need .
Bmr018_625	bk	In the recording ; A bug is what I mean , ; so that it 's like ; Oh , OK .
Bsr001_1537	%--	You know , ; not like say , " OK , ; mmm , let 's role play . ; Your , y " you know , " you do this , you wanna "
Bmr011_1738	s	And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by , uh by any room acoustics ; or is it just uh , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? ; Uh ; It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear
Bmr020_952	s	and then again , starting at sixteen , ; ending at twenty . ; Right , ; so that 's three chunks where actually we w can just make one chunk out of that
Bmr025_889	ba	M ; right . ; right ? ; That would be fine too .
Bro024_979	s	So the other thing is the I 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond . ; So I just just tried another sk system I mean , another filter which I 've like shown at the end . ; Which is very similar to the existing uh , filter . ; Only Uh , only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase
Bed012_745	%--	our final , ; OK . ; definite ; So , when you were saying we need to do a re - run of , like
Bro023_835	s	Oh , OK . ; So , above twenty DB , ; I see . ; it 's one , so you just subtract the noise .
Bmr005_1102	s	You say I I I want to use this uh this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . ; So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh gets subtracted off from the original speech . ; Then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense . ; And so um uh with some constraints .
Bro018_307	%--	something . ; Some some read task actually , that they 're preparing . ; Hmm ! ; For what
Bro012_854	bk	rather than artificial light . ; So if it was a lot if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the ; So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance . ; Oh , OK .
Bed002_142	s	And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , ; and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , ; as well as the close talking mikes . ; What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth ,
Bmr013_539	ba	Interesting idea . ; To to I mean , you 'd wanna iterate , somehow . ; Yeah . ; It 's interesting thing to think about .
Bed014_1017	%	But , I suggested Monday . ; If that 's a problem for me then I shouldn't suggest it . ; Ha - ha - ha . ; OK .
Btr002_316	s	because if if that 's a f nice full falling intonational contour on " that 's a problem " , ; Mm - hmm . ; " eh , that 'll be a problem " . ; then I would think that there should be a period there .
Bro011_556	s	So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features ; and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . ; So look at the difference there ; and then uh do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end .
Bmr030_476	s	So th They , um , they gave They 've given us ; Since we started doing this new , uh , beep format with " beep number beep " , ; Mm - hmm . ; they 've given us , uh , I think , two full , uh , transcripts .
Buw001_1033	b	Yeah , ; fff ! ; So , ; Hmm .
Bmr024_1001	aap	and I was just , doing a minus R star , not realizing that that caused it to be re - backed - up . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; But normally you 're correct .
Buw001_585	s	That 's true are four or five people . ; and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . ; Yeah . ; You just get together and talk about where you are .
Bmr028_111	s	Great ! ; I see . ; And if you don't compute the wavefile , you can't zoom out . ; You can't get a larger view of it .
Bed002_281	s	You have to al also have to read some digits . ; Afterwards . ; OK . OK . Afterwards is fine . ; They are uncomfortable .
Bmr029_842	aa	Oh , oh , oh . I 'm sorry . ; Right . ; So , you wanna do the exact same thing , ; Right .
Bro023_949	s	and now i then you 've subtracted it off . ; And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up . ; Hmm . ; Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either ,
Bro012_1305	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one , ; and uh then you only use for this one distinction . ; Alright .
Bmr020_1656	b	Well good . ; but uh ; That that really simplifies thing then . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1995	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; It 's interesting cuz like , um , when I 'm working late at night , I actually don't feel so lonely
Bmr010_837	bk	Yeah . ; Good . ; Oh ! ; OK .
Bed015_1058	%--	So , th the the big com and and finally " discourse segment " is about sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , ; like utterance - specific kinds of things . ; So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse ; like situation context ,
Bmr001_452	b	So I 've I 've already created a " U U , doctor speech , data , MR " directory , or had Jane do it and uh um but there 's not a lot of free space around . ; No . ; So it it it has currently about four gig on the drive that I think she 's going to put it on um . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2659	b	OK . ; Oh . ; I see what you 're saying . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1035	s	cuz , uh ; while people are talking to each other . ; There you go . ; But there are fewer I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " .
Bed015_397	bk	I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_296	bk	but I think that I was uh proposed before I was asked ? ; And that doesn't matter ; cuz I think there was probably an a uh y an indication that that I was interested in advance ; Oh .
Btr002_2965	s	and potentially those things could probably be rendered , ; although some of them are not even full segments , ; they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say . ; I mean , you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes ,
Btr001_2403	s	which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , ; That 's ; yeah . ; Maybe if maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something .
Bro025_393	b	Mmm . ; So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping . ; S ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1449	%	and that we can control with , you know , who can check things in and stuff . ; So we can I think we can do this . ; Or just , yeah , start by make it a really tight control ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_380	bs	Well , pipelined . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; The idea is that we 're taking less time of the linguists .
Bro022_814	s	Um . ; With some some gap . ; So ; I mean , with some pauses in the center ,
Btr001_2096	%	You know , someone just leaves , ; you know , ; gets coffee , ; Right . Right , right .
Btr002_995	s	and so I 'll al I 'll just be ; if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just ; Oh yeah . ; or vice versa
Bmr028_258	cc	OK . ; I couldn't get the words and the waveform at the same time for some reason , ; and there must be some ; I 'll I 'll work on it with Don and see what I 'm doing wrong .
Bmr020_170	%	Oh . ; Short words . ; because ; I know
Bro018_1006	b	um uh ; but we did eh we did hear this comment from people at some point , that um it uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal . ; So that is an option in RASTA . ; Hmm .
Bmr002_685	b	Oops . ; and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you , ; which is , you know , exactly the problem we have . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_311	bk	which is a standard Wiener filter . ; No , no , ; but I mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bro024_399	no	you can also reflect the data . ; So you take , uh ; you know , ; I 'm not sure how many frames you need .
Bmr018_1306	s	Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head . ; Mm - hmm . ; I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for , ; but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed ,
Bed005_732	b	OK . ; And a l and a lot and and anaphora , and pronouns , ; Nuh . ; Right .
Bmr018_1524	s	It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct . ; OK . ; But , I mean , yes . ; Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data .
Bed005_496	s	So then , whatever takes this M - three - L is what actually changes the state , ; not the ; Yeah , OK . ; No , right , the Discourse Maintainer ,
Bed008_302	s	Right , so what w I what we seem to need here , ; this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff ; mm - hmm ; the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes
Bmr007_264	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I considered that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an " X " with a and the idea is probably , eh when eh when eh , we studied th th that zone , eh eh , we h we have eh eh confusion with eh eh noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; With eh that fricative sounds , but uh I have new information but I have to to study .
Bed009_61	s	and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English ; S ; Mm - hmm . ; because w we have we face two ways .
Bed008_458	co	Yeah , ; I w I was just gonna ; commercial action inside where people p ; Well couldn't I do let 's do commercial
Bro019_641	s	well there are some minor changes , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , right now if we look at the results , it 's , um , always better than it seems always better than France Telecom for mismatch and high - mismatch .
Bro021_261	%--	No . ; It didn't . ; Oh . ; But
Bed015_70	s	Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . ; So I 'll just try to go through them . ; So they could all have a type at the beginning . ; Um , and then they say the key word construction
Bmr005_165	s	I guess it would be the same . ; Uh - huh . ; But there are others that have backchannelling , ; it 's just he was less interested in those .
Bns002_1324	t1	And I envision an an an m an escenario where eh ; Oops ! ; Well , yeah . ; Let 's go .
Bro015_88	bk	It 's next week , yeah . ; When is it ? ; Next week ? ; Oh , OK .
Bro021_1138	b	We have our codebook with different density Gaussian . ; Mm - hmm . ; We can expre we can put that the PDF for the clean test , probability of the clean speech is equal to ; Yeah .
Bmr025_126	b	because it means porting the web server to Windows . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News ; Yeah .
Bed008_781	bk	Yeah . ; ge going through some ; OK . ; Right , sure .
Bns001_1185	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Not just the islands alone . ; Yeah . I ; So why I wasn't ,
Bed012_642	bk	Hmm . ; Four . ; Those are The bottom things are inputs , also . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr003_907	qw	Yeah . ; And it 's not really strictly comparable . ; So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text . ; The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from ?
Bmr021_1033	ba	Never mind . ; It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting . ; Yep . Yep . Yeah yeah . That would be good . ; Oh yeah . That 's a good one .
Bed013_1048	s	Yeah . How how do these pieces fit together ? ; Uh - huh . ; And um . ; But , OK , nevertheless . So these are issues
Buw001_194	s	Good . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design ,
Bmr008_1177	no	Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn . ; so it 's ; Yeah , well , whatever . ; So Uh Yeah , so I I don't know ,
Btr002_739	%--	Oh . ; um yeah , ; Yeah . Yeah , yeah . ; and then you 're just sort you 've got like you know you 're sort of like
Bro018_4	s	So uh , he 's not here , ; So . ; so you get to ; Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week .
Bro017_137	s	and they said " oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . " ; Mm - hmm . ; So now officially , Nokia is uh uh complaining and said they they are looking for support , ; uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too " we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet .
Bro027_656	%--	Uh - huh . ; Oh , OK , ; I see . ; And so , th
Bsr001_615	bk	So , yeah . ; So so what are you guys doing ? ; I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bro010_928	%--	along the way how much should we , uh ; uh , what should we be training these intermediate things for ? ; I mean , because , uh , we don't know uh , that this is a particularly good feature . ; I mean , there 's no way , uh
Bmr005_1117	s	and then it 's getting the sum . ; So um , uh anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try ; somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . ; I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with ,
Bmr012_638	s	we know that for instance the transcripts are very good ; so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text ; um yeah they 're pretty good ; so and and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth
Bed003_188	b	OK . ; but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1209	aa	Yeah the well the b ; but ; anyway so uh it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram . ; Yeah .
Bro005_374	b	Yeah . ; Oh , so you used almost all ; You used two thirds of it , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1076	s	So theoretically you could edit that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It just that it 's ; But they 're not very friendly .
Bro012_934	bk	Yeah . ; OK . ; Um . ; OK .
Bmr016_259	s	but the other differences are so major . ; OK . ; They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's uh ; Yeah I mean read versus not .
Bmr005_182	b	I just wrote this down . ; You just wrote this ? ; Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you had some ideas " ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1508	s	because there 's a " Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . " ; Performance art ,
Bmr022_356	ba	Yeah , just a " two three , two four " , that would be ; Well , they would have to have a mark . ; There 'd be some kind of mark in front of it . ; Interesting .
Bmr003_268	aa	how do we distribute the audio files , ; how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ? ; Well , I think I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance . ; Yeah ,
Bro011_488	aa	Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do . ; So he doesn't have to have truth marks ; or Ho ; F right ,
Bmr023_1091	%--	Yeah . ; These nets are trained with particular normalization ; and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it . ; I 'm doing what Eric
Bmr024_1337	%--	Yeah . ; Do you ? ; and we can ; And in each case , ho
Bmr019_1457	s	I mean , for the evaluations , yes , we 'll run a version that hasn't been touched . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh , one of the reasons I have him messing around with that , because I think it 's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to . ; People always say very glibly that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything ,
Bro007_275	s	Yep . ; Yeah we have the result that the output of the HTK ; Yeah . ; The number of of sentences , no it 's the number isn't .
Bdb001_83	t1	" T equals one point three two " , ; uh ; And then I I also had optional things like accuracy , ; and then " ID equals T one , uh , one seven " .
Bro004_1114	s	yeah . ; Because ; Shouldn't it be ; They s they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature .
Bmr015_459	s	Right , right . ; to different kind of planes . ; So . Um . But , um . ; So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now ,
Bed006_965	b	I mean personally , I 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have X forms , which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the SPG action up there is Enter , then the goal type can never be a statue . ; Uh - huh . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_404	%--	Yeah . ; I also wonder if if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions ? ; I mean , do you think that , um , that , uh , maybe ; I mean , being
Bsr001_2294	s	Mmm . ; but ; So I I ; And and not within a not within a big room .
Bed003_398	t1	that would be whatever building they referred to . ; Prosody . ; Right . ; So let 's see .
Bmr026_163	bd	I guess we reached it . ; Yeah , he he actually he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . ; So . ; Oh well .
Bro024_1073	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So they have their own compression and decoding scheme ; and they I don't know what they have . ; Oh .
Bro026_270	%--	So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So the things that we , um , uh ,
Bro027_661	ba	So ; Ah , OK . ; Uh ; But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , uh , win .
Bmr003_492	s	Uh - huh . ; Well they 're ; this is clever . ; Apparently this was like phase one
Bns002_1233	s	And one additional question from myself , ; but maybe also short , ; because time it running fast . ; Uh , I have heard that uh wireless LAN and Bluetooth will have some problems
Bmr028_193	s	But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then . ; But d y ; Right . ; And then displays all the user interface components .
Bmr026_1101	aa	No ; they were they were comparable . ; It wasn't ? ; No .
Bsr001_2395	co	yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Don't throw it away ; but don't use it in your training .
Bed012_357	s	Or I jus ; But I mean , why do we ; Le ; If we trusted the Go - there node more th much more than we trusted the other ones , then we would conclude , even in this situation , that he wanted to go there .
Bmr015_550	s	So , I mean , you 're dealing with a different domain there , and with start and end times and all that , ; Right . ; and channels and stuff , ; so , it 's a different set .
Btr001_1043	bk	I 've run into that . ; Really ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1091	bk	cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure Th - th ; Yeah . ; which is fine . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns003_335	s	Newbies . ; Newbies ? ; Yeah , OK . ; So , there I have to add some information ,
Bmr023_981	bd	I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , unless you call well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . ; But that 's sort of more both , kind of .
Bmr012_979	s	and if we sink it in ; The other thing is eh ; That be great . ; I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan
Bmr012_467	b	Right . ; Right , so it 's so ; Yeah , ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1724	s	I I wanna think about it ; and you should think about it . ; Yeah . ; I I I didn't want to just pop out an answer
Bro014_1083	bk	Above , um it seems that ; Well , some voiced sound can have also , like , a noisy part on high frequencies , ; and ; Yeah .
Btr002_2497	b	Mmm . ; U i cu there 's there 's at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different . ; You know , there 's like , you know , that , ; Right .
Bed002_1180	s	Two days ? ; Huh ? ; Two , three days ? ; Yeah bu w I 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , uh , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package
Bmr011_943	b	Yeah . ; And especially since a lot of these ; Uh , it sort of depends where you are in ; Yeah .
Bed011_96	bk	This is the speaker information form . ; Got it . ; OK , fine . ; OK .
Bro012_459	s	So . ; I should find that new one . ; I just use my old one from ninety - two or whatever ; Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different
Bro024_1372	b	Yeah . ; so the system ; so the VAD was trained on maybe different set of labels for channel zero and channel one ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_431	s	" NONVOC " for door - slam , ; and " GLOSS " for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . ; Right . ; I already had that convention
Bmr015_1059	s	OK , well ; If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting , ; even And ; we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there ,
Bed016_689	%--	In other news . ; OK , so , um , ; anything else you want to ask us about ; the thesis proposal , you got
Bed006_1777	s	Plus it 's hip . ; But what if it 's not an action ? ; The kids 'll like it . ; Yeah all the kids 'll love it .
Bed008_341	%--	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Drunk . ; Therefore
Bmr010_1071	%	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But anyway , I 'm I 'm open to c our consideration . ; That 'd be great .
Bro023_502	s	Yeah . ; but the final filter , what they do is they they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse Fourier transform . ; Uh - huh . ; And they filter the original signal using that fil filter ,
Bed010_404	bk	No , ; he 's not gonna do that . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed011_1085	%--	Yeah . ; And if if there 's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does ; and we have to do it , ; but
Bmr028_410	aa	He said it 's hard to find things you say wrong . ; Hmm . ; It 's hard to find anything that you say in these . ; Yep .
Bmr021_967	s	Alright . ; So . ; You can really tell from the prosody where it goes . ; s meeting .
Bmr019_337	s	Yep . ; Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics ; and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise . ; And that should really improve things , um , further .
Bed016_1074	%--	Fixed . ; A fixed expression , yeah . ; that 's a , uh ; Right . But .
Bro023_119	s	Um , ; I mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing . ; Wa ; Yeah , it seems like for your I mean , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech ,
Bmr027_1240	s	That 's a great ambiguity . ; Yeah . ; It 's one of these ; it 's it 's social
Bed004_133	s	OK . ; And um the wizard sometimes will not be audible , ; Because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless , ; we have to move her closer .
Bro003_46	co	I was just wondering , does this mean the battery 's dying and I should change it ? ; Uh I think that means the battery 's O K . ; d do you ; Let me see .
Bmr006_926	t3	So , we don't know . ; This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . ; And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data ; Supervised clustering .
Bmr003_1908	b	so we can add in links and stuff like that to other things . ; and ; Nice . ; Yep .
Bro011_50	s	Yeah . ; What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? ; So we had ; I forget .
Bro024_451	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Are you gonna do any dry runs for your thing , ; or are you just gonna
Bro027_1034	s	Um , not no relation . ; No relation . ; So I I I don't understand , ; The f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features .
Bmr021_166	cc	It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is . ; Perfect . ; Perfect , OK . ; OK , so we 'll de definitely go ahead and do that .
Bmr006_455	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; But it als It it it also I think builds up towards the goal . ; It 's a novelty item .
Bmr015_838	s	eh , that , eh , they are not harmonics . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them
Bmr011_755	s	Uh , transcriptions . ; Transcriptions , OK . ; Um , I thought about there are maybe three aspects of this . ; So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers .
Bmr014_35	aa	and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , ; so I ; Oh really . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1788	bk	Yeah . ; We also had the , uh , uh that we were s uh , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number ; and we 're all gonna ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr019_1278	s	that that Not the best ; Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point ; and yo then you can bring in the other person . ; So it 's actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal ,
Bmr003_1284	d	Yes . ; And what 's your plan ? ; Mm - hmm . ; To carry on doing it ?
Bmr012_650	b	Congratulations ; is really great . ; well it was , I mean I really didn't do this myself ; Yeah .
Bro012_866	%--	but then the second order is is the variances ; OK . ; OK . ; because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B
Bmr019_1565	s	And Brian 's coming , ; so that 's six . ; Mm - hmm . ; And plus all of us .
Bmr005_400	s	So i if two or more people are talking . ; I see . ; OK . ; Yeah . So I think Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .
Bmr026_28	s	For IBM , yeah . ; OK . ; Hmm . ; and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .
Bmr020_830	%	Alright . ; OK . ; Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version , ; yeah . OK .
Bed005_60	cc	So . ; But I I will just make a first draft of the , uh , note , ; the " write - up " note , ; send it to you and Fey
Bsr001_2251	b	I don't know . ; Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if if if we were to have this kind of coordination thing , some some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point ; Well I think that ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_174	s	And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement . ; That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months , ; Oh OK . ; but it means we can not think about it for six months .
Bro027_1019	%	So , ; yeah , maybe we can add some context from these features also as Dan did in in his last work . ; Could . ; i
Bmr028_1379	s	Yeah . ; or ; Right . ; You know . So she certainly can define it .
Bdb001_686	s	Suppose you have a word sequence ; and you have two different segmentations of that same word sequence . ; f Say , one segmentation is in terms of , um , you know , uh , sentences . ; And another segmentation is in terms of , um , I don't know , prosodic phrases .
Btr002_914	s	I don't do that either . ; I didn't n even even know you could do that . ; I vary . ; I I should it depends on how much I wanna go back
Bro024_1290	s	But , ; well , the the " Car " noises are below like five hundred hertz . ; And we were looking at the " Music " utterances ; and in this case the noise is more about two thousand hertz .
Bed012_829	bk	OK . ; I always have to check , every time y I send you an email , a past email of yours , to make sure I 'm spelling your name correctly . ; Yeah . ; That 's good .
Btr002_3340	aa	Yes . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ? ; Oh . Yes .
Bmr026_901	b	and and uh , um , and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT . ; Hmm . ; Uh But uh which So that 's what they 're they 're using now . ; Mmm .
Bro012_387	b	So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_875	bk	Um ; What are their inputs ? ; Uh ; Right ,
Bro005_1192	bs	and it 's it uh it 's just that they d it 's trained up , ; right ? ; That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . ; So they did At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary .
Btr002_1665	aa	The ones with Liz , and you . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1480	s	Yeah , that was an interesting discussion , ; The ; uh , I ; It it it was the only one It was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about .
Bdb001_63	bk	So you should , definitely . ; Um , so so it definitely had that as a concept . ; So tha it has a single time - line , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_154	bs	Yes , absolutely . ; if if we can figure out a way to do it . ; Yeah . ; Uh . But we were agreed that in addition to that uh there should be s stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth .
Bro018_426	ba	Yeah . ; Do have Have people sort of stopped going to ICASSP in recent years ? ; Um , people are less consistent about going to ICASSP ; and I think it 's still it 's still a reasonable forum for students to to present things .
Bmr016_2254	%	So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_416	s	So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion . ; There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . ; Uh . ; I sort of think you should ,
Bed015_80	s	And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk one type of constituent , ; that is a constructional constituent . ; I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . ; But in general instead of the word " construct " , th here you might have " meaning " or " form " as well .
Bed014_1167	b	OK , yeah , understood . ; But that 's part of the formalism ; is got to be uh , how things like that get marked . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_2304	%--	Great . ; Great . ; Great . ; h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ?
Bed003_344	bk	That was like our example . ; That was the initial one that we found . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr006_836	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . ; OK .
Bmr002_802	s	so , you know , but focus on tools to do this stuff ; um , I do have a file also in addition to those things , ; but ; it 'll take me just a second here
Bed016_567	s	And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists .
Bro019_578	b	and another difference I guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this ; without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the LDA filters , ; and ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_459	s	I w I was just gonna ; commercial action inside where people p ; Well couldn't I do let 's do commercial ; uh landmark
Bed009_997	b	Yeah . ; so So I th I think that probably as good an introduction as you 'll get . ; Mm - hmm . ; Ah .
Bmr013_697	%--	Yeah . ; but , I would have maybe a transciber , uh , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . ; Yeah . ; To a adjust them , or ,
Bmr011_1003	co	but ; Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's ; yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of ; Well we can talk about more details later .
Bro024_1663	bk	Oh , it w it was you . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Uh Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2266	qw	and not any of the facts . ; That is , I I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today . ; So that 's what really impressed me . ; How are we gonna find that in the data ?
Bmr027_191	s	And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , ; something like a week before that , ; uh , J July fifteenth date , ; or two weeks before .
Bro016_852	s	Right . ; compared to , you know , a smaller set of log probs . ; Yeah . ; No . Again you don't really look at that .
Bmr011_11	s	u OK . ; Why is it so cold in here ? ; so , uh , ; we haven't sent around the agenda .
Bro028_349	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization , ; Mm - hmm . ; which ,
Bed005_774	%--	Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; And , again , it 's just a question of which of these things , uh , people want to dive into . ; What , uh , I think I 'm gonna try to do ,
Bmr010_185	s	to have , er ; to have , um ; yeah ; to have more or less , uh , silence portions in inserted .
Bro007_393	co	so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth ; Yeah but ; Mm - hmm . ; but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these .
Bns001_1789	bk	And we can go in different directions . ; And if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or UMTS or whatever , great . ; If not , the long term and then these things must be , nevertheless must be defined in much more detail . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2132	s	because i What if we have like " read letters " ; or , I don't know , ; We might wanna just a separate tag that says it 's read . ; like " read something "
Bro021_1307	%--	it 's only ; it 's only one ; Wait a minute . ; This is
Bmr014_410	%--	OK . ; Well that 's that 's a way that 's ; You know , the spell - check basically does that ; but but in addition
Bro014_267	s	But the but , um , the other thing ; In ; I don't know ; I haven't thought it through ,
Bed017_113	s	And , um , ; the ; um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , ; and why it is s somewhat related ,
Bro019_467	%--	I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . ; I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . ; Wow . ; w
Bro012_1062	s	Mmm . ; set uh of features , ; just mel cepstra , ; and you inc incorporate the different V A
Bmr012_1345	ft	Alright . ; Yeah . ; Um good . ; Thank you though ,
Bmr005_354	s	Ye ; were you ? ; You were just talking about acoustic events . ; I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,
Bmr008_291	b	and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1017	%--	Yeah , well , ; uh . ; There also could be I mean . I can maybe see a reason f for both working on it too ; if um you know , if if if you work on something else and and you 're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction
Btr002_430	s	like " groups of " ; Yeah , because it 's , um , bilabial too . ; " Fff " . you know , you 'll ; di uh , or interl interdental , " fff " .
Bro019_84	bk	OK . ; Why don't you start with that ? ; That 's sort of ; OK .
Bmr029_169	b	Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say next . ; So ; We hafta cut the , uh ; Right .
Bmr002_543	s	Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns ; and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , " this is where this speaker change came in " ; and of course that gets really difficult when you 're talking about ; I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in uh your lunch talk ,
Bmr026_245	s	So ; Just three different ; It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's ; I mean we could do it in Matl - I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .
Bro023_633	x	but it works reasonably well . ; I see . ; And and then you What you do is you , uh b ; fff .
Bmr009_291	s	Mm - hmm . ; So . Locally . ; just locally , yeah . ; And I was just going to say that that right now we 're just exploring .
Bmr016_109	aa	Yeah . ; but I mean it seems to me that , at least for us , we can learn to read them as digits ; if that 's what people want . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_238	ba	I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten . ; They sound really good . ; So . ; That 's a great idea .
Bmr011_1652	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; if you know any groups that are m you know , ; Well I had asked some some of the students at the business school .
Bed017_107	bk	so , to avoid some confusion . ; That will be Reuter ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Bro004_168	aap	So . ; Yeah . ; Twenty percent further ? ; Twenty to to thirty percent further .
Bro012_974	b	and we 're trying to use something something else . ; And . ; Yeah , and also to understand what happens because ; OK .
Bed017_229	s	but , um , we 'll see . ; So w Anyway . So that 's a a major open issue . ; If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run ; and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems ,
Bmr008_477	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh I I I just missed something , though . ; Are you saying that you have both ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_111	b	but it was . ; Mm - hmm ! ; Oh , good . ; OK .
Bro024_47	s	That 's that 's worth looking into . ; Um , ; d and , um , ; ap ap apart from that , I guess the the main thing I have t ta I have to talk is , um , where I 'm planning to go over the next week .
Bmr031_894	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Everything on the ; Yeah . ; So , I mean , it 's
Bmr008_1691	s	Yeah . ; That they 're much longer than I expected . ; But this is very short . ; Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds .
Bro022_245	bk	It 's , uh ; Oh , this room ? ; It 's it 's this room . ; OK .
Bro015_13	b	So . So . ; Uh . That 's my news . ; Alright . ; Cool .
Bmr029_923	bk	Right ? ; and , um , I think by tomorrow I 'll have it for th for the rest . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . Alright .
Bmr008_1454	s	I I 'm wo ; but but ; Exactly . ; So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel recordings .
Bro024_718	s	w ; But the but the , uh , forty - seven point nine percent which you have now , that 's already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal . ; Yeah . ; So we had forty - four percent in the first proposal .
Btr001_2649	b	It 's right here , ; Oh , I see . ; yeah . I looked for that too . ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_722	%--	Yeah , ; I think this context node is a bit of a ; I don't know , ; like in d
Bro014_1231	t3	The filters roughly act like a , um a , uh a an overall resonant you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation . ; Here . ; They should be more close . ; Ah , no .
Bro026_1053	qw	Yeah , ; I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit ; I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , ; but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .
Bed006_980	b	Yeah ? ; S So um , like are you gonna have similar schemas for FM ; Louis . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1005	%--	No , you 're right , ; actually ; I think that when Brian comes , this 'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well b ; When
Btr002_51	x	And these are uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts . ; I 'm just doing this cuz I think it 's interesting . ; OK . So , um , I have an example ; OK . @ @ Not sure .
Bmr007_988	2	What I 'm doing is trying to use the close - talking mike and just use Can - and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works . ; Yeah ! ; Actually actually actually ; You have candidates .
Bed015_1814	qh	I just mean ; There 's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . ; Yeah . ; But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ?
Bmr030_454	s	and ; Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy . ; So I mean , that 's the easy way . ; They might have a more complex set - up at IBM .
Bns003_767	b	but , you know , sometimes , especially in the in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open ; and , well , it it is something that can be changed . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bed005_600	s	And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . ; Probably Johno . ; OK . ; Uh , take what they have ,
Bmr003_1403	b	I see . ; Uh - huh . ; and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that . ; Mmm .
Bmr031_1393	b	but but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data . ; So we might want to look into that . ; Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . ; Right .
Bmr024_626	qy	Yeah . ; But but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that . ; Right ? ; Is is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ?
Bmr005_719	s	Sure , ; because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .
Bmr009_1494	s	Just uses a lot of memory . ; So when you say " slow " , does that mean to ; No , the the one that 's installed is fine . ; It 's not slow at all .
Bro003_1988	bk	Do you know ? ; Allows for ? ; Multiple targets being one ? ; Oh ,
Bmr021_521	%--	Anyone else care ? ; No . ; And I and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's if there 's any get his input on it . ; I don't think I don't think that 'll be
Bro013_740	ar	Perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the ; if we want to the the guy to say " O " ; or ; No .
Btr002_2090	b	Yeah . ; Really ? ; Occasionally . ; Yeah .
Bns003_667	s	And , uh , ; well , eh ; even later if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on , ; well I I will be able to to do some work from Spain too .
Bdb001_1299	s	Yeah . ; what if they haven't notated with them , times ? ; Yeah . ; He he 's a language modeling person , though .
Bed010_564	b	In Hebrew it means " park behind the car " , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you . ; Mm - hmm . ; Intrinsic , ; yeah .
Bmr018_1281	b	and we had just a bag with a bunch of marbles in it as a counter - balance . ; Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people . ; If people those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something , ; Yeah !
Bmr006_406	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ; Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .
Bdb001_85	bk	And then I I also had optional things like accuracy , ; and then " ID equals T one , uh , one seven " . ; And then , I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp . ; Right .
Bmr014_272	%--	I guess ; Was the decision last time was that the the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Has that started , or is that ?
Bmr020_842	s	which you know , is just , probably random . ; Yeah , it was a small difference ; but yeah . ; But , um they probably w want the originals .
Bmr030_858	aa	minus show - ATTR " . ; Maybe you can send me that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_392	aa	So this is what , node one ? ; This is node two ; and this is the source , ; Yeah .
Bed003_414	b	Whatever granularity . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr011_1746	no	Yeah . ; but I I think the rest is cross - talk . ; That that may be true . ; But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods
Bmr012_1027	co	We can fit we have room for one more wireless ; and the wireless , ; this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars , ; it I didn't realize but we also have to get a tuner the receiver the other end ,
Bro022_626	aa	Yeah . ; And , so , is your two point seven comparable , ; where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_1341	b	so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something . ; Ah , yeah . ; But it but uh , anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example ; Yeah .
Bed014_325	s	Mmm . ; So there 's a term " dynamic belief - net " , doesn't mean that . ; It means time slices . ; And Srini used those and people use them .
Btr002_2136	b	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_94	%--	Right . ; w w uh , which is certainly one interesting thing . ; And then , um , ; Dave
Bro022_560	b	Right . ; it might be better with ; it might be worse if the channel is constant , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1510	b	You know , on Boston New York , ; Yeah . ; New York Rhode Island , ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1343	aa	If you tell me what you mean , I can write a program to do it . ; Right . ; You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it . ; Right .
Bmr029_674	bk	Uh ; That will just be a copy of the one above it , except for different models from training . ; Well , we also have to mean subtract the test data . ; Ah . OK .
Bmr002_399	ba	Oh , I actually have some foot pedals for the P C . ; Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to ; OK . ; Oh , that 'd be super .
Bmr003_967	s	it might save ninety percent of the work though . ; but , yes . ; So . ; So I I need to we need to look at what what the final output is
Bro023_75	s	Twelve seconds , um , counting back from the end of the current frame , ; yeah . ; OK , ; So it was , um , twen I think it was twenty - one frames
Bro013_207	bs	So it 's ; You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here . ; Yeah . ; It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data .
Bmr009_715	s	Coming off of the other ; Yeah . ; Good . ; So , it wouldn't be I wasn't planning to label the time marks .
Bed009_820	s	Yeah , it 's in in this direction . ; Hmm . ; The ; From Michael Strube , I 've heard very good stuff about the chunk parser that is done by FORWISS ,
Bmr021_952	bk	Do we have any other topics ? ; OK , let 's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time . ; Poetic reading of digits . ; Oh no .
Bmr013_387	%--	It 's you 're going all the way down , ; so sure . ; Right . ; That 's what I meant is
Bro022_1045	s	So , I 'm just playing around . ; So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , ; so I 'm not going to change it that much . ; But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit .
Btr002_2981	s	Then ; That 's what I usually do too . ; Right . ; I was wondering who had been putting those in .
Bmr016_1491	ba	but , uh , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have " eh " in also , um , American e e data represented here . ; But ; any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list , ; Yeah this is great .
Bro024_1336	b	That 's true . ; So the alignments from the different database that are used for training came from different system . ; Syste ; Yeah .
Bmr022_928	s	You you put it over the corner of your ear . ; Yeah , over the corner of the ear ; I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here . ; There 's another kind which s goes in your ear
Bmr014_652	s	So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , ; and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . ; And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . ; And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue .
Bed011_241	aa	Y yeah thi well this is a question for ; And that way you get the speech data of people saying " zoo " over and over again or whatever too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_816	%--	Hey ! ; Um , just you can just sit here . ; Uh , I d I don't think we want to mess with the microphones ; but it 's uh
Bmr021_21	ba	Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape . ; So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings . ; I see . ; They don't work for me very well .
Bsr001_2505	b	I don't know . ; It 's it 's a different task . ; can't we ? ; Yeah ,
Bed005_40	s	Oh , OK , then we won't do it . ; So . ; OK . ; So that 's easy .
Bed016_350	b	yeah , yeah ; and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , ; so that ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1196	b	The question is , " is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval ? " ; Uh - huh . ; So , w will the application the Meeting Recorder application , work ? ; Yeah .
Bed016_134	aa	in our beloved tourism domain . ; But , with a focus on ; Can I s ; I think I need a copy of this , yes .
Bmr002_957	aa	Oh , cool . ; Very cool . ; No no question . ; Yeah .
Bed015_577	s	You know , there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . ; It just says , " Here . ; Add this structure to this space . " ; and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open .
Bro023_1748	b	The energy also . ; The energy . ; Yeah . Of course . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_951	s	Yeah . ; that th he has these little chuckles as he talks . ; Yeah . OK . ; I 'm sure it 's very individual .
Bmr011_892	bk	So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . ; I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bmr007_633	g	Well , that 's the that was my my status report , ; Yeah . ; You 've been working on that . ; right ?
Bmr016_2253	%	and so it 's a question of like what ; So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1475	%--	I mean , the th the reason why , uh , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; we should at least look at the space and understand
Bmr011_24	b	Now , yeah . ; It 's on ? ; Hello . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1297	%--	Yeah , OK . ; S ; We just We sort of thought , " yes , " y y I mean ; At the last meeting , my recollection was that we felt people would have uh less
Bns002_910	s	because now the problem with transceivers is that a lot of power is uh consumed at the logic of the transceiver , ; and not uh transmitted to the air . ; It is not power transferred to the air . ; So , the problem now is that eh most of the power uh , uh t uh a wireless network card is consuming , is is is drawn by the by the eh logic control of the card .
Bro017_372	b	I start from from here , ; so you you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . ; And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same . ; Mmm .
Bmr006_633	s	I think it 's DI . ; OK , ; I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we ; I don't remember .
Bed008_920	b	Mm - hmm . ; Could be . ; you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the ; Yeah .
Bro010_102	bk	OK . ; Alright . ; Um , ; Yeah .
Bro004_200	%--	Uh same language we are at uh for at English at O point eight . ; So it improves , compared to the baseline . ; But ; So .
Bro005_833	bs	OK . ; So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , ; yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we don't do as well as in the target thing . ; But you 're saying that uh , it is Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about .
Bmr020_203	s	You sent it to me ; but I haven't seen it yet . ; uh ; three kinds of uh results , if you will .
Bed012_466	s	and Info - on is High . ; Well , yeah , just out of the other three , though , that you had in the ; Hmm ? ; those three nodes .
Bed015_1416	b	That comes in ; discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , " oh , when you focus something " then ; and , uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1248	s	Mm - hmm . ; If I never do an estimat a newer estimation of the noise , this mean as mean and the variance are fixed . ; Mm - hmm . ; And for each s uh , frame of the speech the only thing that I need to do is to calculate this
Bmr010_29	bk	OK . ; Sure . ; Well , um , I can give you an update on the transcription effort . ; Great .
Bro003_1695	%--	so you may have you may have had other goals , uh , for going up , ; and any anything else you can think of would be we should think about accomplishing ? ; I mean , I 'm just saying this because maybe there 's things we need to do in preparation . ; Oh , I think basically , this is this is ,
Bed015_402	%--	um , the un sort of the un - addressed questions in this , um , definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about . ; Yeah . ; Here are just bindings ; but ,
Bmr024_1217	ar	Is there less training data ? ; uh ; I mean , we don ; No , actually there 's more training data .
Btr002_1628	%--	Wait , a favorite what ? ; A a fav a favorite t type of meeting that you like , ; or , um or ; Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like like , um , Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo
Bed005_822	%--	um ; And sort of we don't know how to handle them , too . ; Right ? ; I mean , it 's
Bns001_1362	bk	That 's right . ; Absolutely . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1023	%--	a ? ; You know ? ; How how much how much extra would you allow at most ; I I wanted to
Bmr008_1543	s	j my ? ; Do you do you have a a pitch detector that you are using in these experiments ? ; Pitch . ; eh , I I 'm working now with pitch detector .
Bro011_142	s	and and that and expected that they would do certain things ; Mm - hmm . ; and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you ; and they were sort of waiting for you
Bed014_143	aa	OK , got it . ; What language is that written ; i Is that that Scheme thing that you showed me ? ; Yeah .
Bmr023_786	s	you know , Chuck and I talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @ to to this to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all . ; We just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system . ; Hmm . ; And , for instance , uh , Dan @ @ Dan just sent me a message saying that CMU used , um , something like ten Gaussians per cluster
Bro018_487	s	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; um But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong . ; I mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that .
Bro024_837	b	It 's ; And that we , so , introduce again some natural behavior in this trajectory . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_762	s	Oh . ; No , no . ; I 'm not I 'm not planning to do any any phoneme mapping yet . ; Just it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection of phonological features .
Bro014_154	s	and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc . ; So , ; um , ; uh , I can I can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work .
Bro023_16	ba	We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something . ; Huh . ; So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing ; Cool .
Bmr007_97	%--	And , um What you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right , whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers . ; And , um and , what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're bursts of them . ; Um . ; And it looked to me as though
Bed013_380	s	It 's both , right ? ; It 's it 's sort of t cognitive , neural , psycho , linguistic , ; but all for the sake of doing computer science . ; So it 's sort of cognitive , psycho , neural , plausibly motivated , architectures of natural language processing .
Bmr020_297	s	that 's a good point . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; but this obvious thing to see if if there 's a dependence on the number of uh participants .
Bed016_1159	qh	So , I mean ; you know you know , where r ; Yeah . ; What color was this in in in the nain nineteenth century .
Bmr001_719	s	Yeah . ; probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read ; We could we could have the reading group in here . ; Yeah , I mean it 's a different style .
Bro018_511	b	So . ; Yeah , you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is , you could maybe take some subset and you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand ; and then see how different it is from you know , the canonical ones , ; Right .
Bro013_439	s	But only to play . ; And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the um mel filter bank . ; Uh - huh . ; And , well , is more or less robust .
Bed003_1405	s	And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise ; and ; Anyway . ; So one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of " admission fee discussion " as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have .
Bed015_1528	s	OK , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is . ; Well , not not always . ; I mean , so there 's " and then he said , I w " Uh - huh . ; " I " within the current world .
Bmr016_2247	b	like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I was just I mean , originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out . ; Right .
Btr002_3036	b	I see . ; Eh Um , so if they go " r e m m " , I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " . ; Oh . ; Hmm .
Bro027_1363	2	So either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . ; Yeah , it was it was slightly worse . ; Uh . ; Slightly bad .
Bmr007_824	s	Hmm . ; OK . ; And then I median - filtered that using , um a fairly long filter length . ; Uh well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers .
Bmr016_328	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Especially for speakers that don't talk a lot . ; So um , ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2183	s	yeah . ; Yeah , ; I I mean , ; this this is something that re re requires a bootstrap .
Bmr008_1322	%	Ah . ; OK , so this is post bug fix . ; Yeah , yeah . ; OK ?
Bed008_1540	s	OK . ; OK . ; I mean , I I I I was uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail ; and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now
Bsr001_827	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and then you can degrade it by using the P Z ; Yeah , yeah .
Btr001_1488	%--	Cuz ; y OK . ; Huh . ; Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where there 'd be a misunderstanding about like
Bro027_1273	s	Yeah , right . ; Uh , that 's right , that 's right . ; Um ; Well that that says that , you know , the , um the models in in , uh , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features .
Bro021_845	s	Yeah . In the ; Because it 's a little bit different of the other method . ; Well , we have ; If this if this is the noise signal , uh , in the log domain , we have something like this .
Btr002_2200	s	And they hadn't spoken yet ; cuz he just came on the elevator ; and he says ; uh , and then she then she said something
Bro010_419	aa	We was think ; on on the mel frequency bands , ; so . Yeah , ; Yeah ,
Bed009_437	%	Yep . ; Uh , y y your I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module ; you know th the functional module that that interacts with with where the tourism g stuff is going probably is too restrictive . ; Yep .
Btr001_2098	s	gets coffee , ; Right . Right , right . ; comes back , ; and no one knows .
Bmr028_563	b	No , it 's not bad . ; That 's good . ; but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing not no speech between those . ; Hmm .
Btr001_334	bk	And you got to know his pronunciation of them . ; Yeah . ; So when he said " sign - yah " , and it sounds like " sign " , he was saying " signal " . ; I remember , yeah .
Bmr016_1968	%--	And then , in here , " NUMS " , ; so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss . ; It comes out as " NUMS quote dot five " . ; OK now , the other example is , in the glosses right there ,
Bed013_1183	s	It 's the same . ; Thoughts ? ; Questions ? ; I 'm thinking about it .
Btr002_1330	g	so . ; Yeah . ; I also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed , ; so I don't think you could use a string search , right ?
Bmr029_138	s	and And , uh , it 's not an impossible amount of time . ; Mm - hmm . ; We we were guestimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time , or something ? ; So , if there 's thirty hours of data , you can calculate that he can do , uh , the enhancement in a day
Btr001_992	b	and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , ; so it 's it 's definitely there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether " kay " is is enough of a variant ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Btr001_1956	b	Yeah . ; It 's really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe ; because there can be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1308	b	And how do you determine when to to stop iterating ? ; Um ; Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations . ; Hmm .
Buw001_1634	qw	mostly together . ; uh , I need to email Adam or Jane , ; um , about getting the data . ; Who should I email ?
Bed003_1378	s	and um " yeah I would like uh um to g let 's do it " and so forth . ; So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened .
Bdb001_650	no	So the type is " utterance " equals " utt " . ; And you could either say that ; No . ; I don't know
Bro023_1223	aa	but but but it 's but at any rate , yeah , people , ; uh ; People do that ? ; y yeah ,
Bmr003_1606	bk	Yeah . ; Right . ; I think whenever we use these speech words we should always do the thing like you 're talking about , accent , ; Oh , I see what you mean .
Bro015_79	s	So @ @ it was t ; Yeah there is no surpri there is no surprise . ; Well , so there is nor significant improvement . ; Um . Yeah , basically that 's all .
Bmr029_426	aa	And then , have to ask , um , I guess , Don to , uh , cut the , um , cut the segments for the sh for the tis distant mike . ; Uh , uh that 's So we would be using the same channel for each fo for everything ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1130	s	OK . ; It just queues it up and and when it 's available , it will copy it . ; Yeah . ; And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do ,
Bro021_280	bk	Yeah . ; Well , he yeah , he had to figure out how much to add . ; So he was looking he was looking at the peak value . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_1505	s	Alright . ; We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it ; Well , OK . ; going and dealing with it .
Bns002_1189	s	and Miguel , should I should ask you one question . ; Yeah . ; And uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies . ; You know , frequency hopping , uh two modes and and and also infrared .
Bro010_555	bk	Oh , yeah . ; OK . ; So you have a mixture of two Gaussians . ; Yeah .
Bed013_767	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I guess four pages you could ; I mean you could definitely it 's definitely possible to do it . ; It 's just It 'd just be small .
Bro004_224	s	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; uh different words , I 'm sure , ; but but uh , uh the same task and so on .
Bmr016_950	s	yeah , y we could probably write something to do that , ; but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out ; cuz you can run them , you know , in different orders . ; You c you can actually move them around .
Bed006_63	s	Um . ; Officially I guess he will be joining us in the summer . ; yes . ; And um hopefully it is by by means of Keith that we will be able to get a b a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is
Bmr011_150	b	Yeah . ; cuz it 's a fixed boom . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed016_666	b	It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial ; Well , this is this motivated ; but yeah ; Yeah .
Btr002_3448	ft	I can go . ; OK . ; OK . Wonderful . ; Thank you very , very much .
Bro017_896	aa	Right . ; Yes . ; Multiply . ; Exactly .
Bro019_958	s	So there is one guy in Grenada , ; Yeah , in Grenada ; and another in uh , Lucent that I met at ICASSP . ; one of my friend .
Bro010_736	s	or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's it 's i i i ; using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well .
Bmr029_723	s	They 're popping up . ; Yeah . ; He went to put them on and then something happened . ; And he sent around a note saying " Oh , uh , it didn't work , and we 'll have to schedule another time . "
Btr001_30	b	And um , I just I just put down some ideas ; you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier . ; And , um , ; Mmm .
Bmr015_448	aa	Yeah . ; Because the other ; Yeah it 's go higher level stuff than we 've been talking about for Meeting Recorder . ; Yeah .
Bed004_123	%--	OK . ; And she didn't ; I should ; I mean .
Bmr014_196	s	Right . ; And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , ; as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . ; That seems to be the key issue .
Bsr001_995	b	Mm - hmm . ; And you know it 's apparently engaging people . ; Uh , it 's been going on for a while now . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr019_1077	s	or ? ; Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts for doing the research ,
Bmr027_923	%--	It 's we could do it , uh I I could I 'd be happy with either way , ; batch - wise ; What I was thinking ; Uh , so this one
Bmr005_1073	bk	Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would ; um ; I 'm signing off . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_907	b	and then another button was " that 's great " ; and another button " that 's f " ; Or like this is my " I 'm supposed to do this " kind of button , ; Yeah .
Bro005_896	b	But ; Yeah . ; Results are only coming for for this net . ; Mmm .
Bmr023_176	t3	Mm - hmm . ; And so now with Thilo 's segmenter working so well , I think we should consider doing a ; Mmm . So . ; Come on .
Bro026_684	s	I see . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So we have the data , just not the recognizer .
Bmr018_1471	ar	Yep . ; Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ? ; Hm - umm . ; No .
Bmr010_1436	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; And right now he 's doing that with silence ; and that doesn't work
Bro005_286	bk	Yeah , sorry . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . Alright .
Bmr019_79	b	and ; Oh , yeah . ; so it could get real real car noise . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_702	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bed002_175	s	It should be on already . ; Um . ; Either one of those . ; And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms .
Bns002_1167	s	I 've been use it for for a while , ; and it w can tell you it works pretty well . ; and uh , the thing is that these devices have two different modes of operation . ; One of them , and probably the most popular , is uh l what we call the " infrastructure mode " ,
Bmr019_1302	b	Well , what I 'm thinking is ; No , it 's that 's the good thing about these pape paper deadlines and , uh , you know , class projects , and and things like that , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_613	s	But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet . ; And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in . ; Hmm . ; But I don't know how to I don't know how the operating system would like having two sound cards .
Bmr005_291	s	It was it was just it was just unconscious well , semi - conscious behavior . ; Uh - huh . ; I sorta knew I was doing it but it was ; Well , I still don't know who " he " is .
Btr001_260	%--	if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this " ; and then I figured out what they were saying . ; Mm - hmm . ; um , but with the Spanish speakers it was
Bmr029_638	bk	would be really easy once you 've got the top one going . ; Yeah . ; I could do that . ; Right .
Bro019_837	b	Yeah , ; so we can ; So maybe in my implementation I should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing ; Yeah .
Btr002_1825	b	you know , the sighing ; and the , " Oh no ! " ; You know , it 's it 's , uh , i There are lot 's of nuances which we uh , which we use very often . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_753	bk	If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that . ; O - You you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you . ; All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . ; Right .
Bmr006_444	2	Oh . ; and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , ; but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , ; Mmm . Of the meeting ?
Bmr015_471	b	also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off , ; grants that are ending , ; or other things that are ending , ; Right .
Bed006_1472	s	And ; OK . ; Be great . ; and how this can come about ,
Bed002_695	s	Where you have where your , uh , current goal is to ; We ; Yeah ! ; That 's what we 're doing .
Bed009_473	cc	Yep . ; And um mmm You don't know ; OK th ; I 'll I 'll talk to Michael
Bed010_335	aa	But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . ; Is is that right ? ; I mean that 's that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ? ; Absolutely .
Bed004_813	s	and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , ; you shouldn't have to do that differently ; for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , ; for uh telling someone else how to go there ,
Bmr016_453	s	Oh like a round , ; yeah , like in a a ; Like a , ; Yeah , just pairwise ,
Bed008_994	b	should we make a Keith note here ? ; That sort of comes from Keith . ; Sure . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1233	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; One one question .
Bmr019_977	s	OK . ; But you 're actually saying that certain , uh , speakers were mis mis - identified . ; but it 's good to know . ; Yeah . So , with under um , uh , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , I got Adam 's voice confused with Dan 's and vice versa
Bro012_1371	s	But we were thinking , we discussed with Barry about this , ; and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT ; Uh - huh . ; and see if giving the d uh , this voicing bit would help in in terms of uh frame classification .
Bro012_228	bk	f for point from You change at point one ; yeah . ; Hmm . ; Oh !
Bro018_967	%--	I don't know . ; I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better , ; but I think that in general it 's not that critical . ; I mean there 's
Bmr008_123	s	Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet . ; Yeah , but One one dimension . ; Yeah . ; And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also .
Bro014_198	s	Uh , I have to look it up and see . ; Oh , OK . ; Um , ; there because they start off with , uh , an initial model
Bmr031_193	bk	But but that was read speech . ; You only used that for digits ? ; I mean ; Right .
Btr002_3108	s	Yeah , I do remember that . ; Yeah . ; But it was very quiet . ; So I can see how that would have been sort of gone over by accident .
Bed003_490	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Nice walls ? ; Wi ; Oh .
Bmr024_187	2	Yeah , but are we having them do digits ? ; Yes . ; Because , uh , we don't we didn't In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it . ; We we didn't cut those out .
Bed014_317	s	It 's a hard puzzle . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models .
Bmr011_1816	b	because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1306	ar	Yeah . ; Aw , thanks . ; How long does it take , just briefly , like t to OK . to label the , ; No .
Bmr011_1111	b	Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers ; and ; uh , I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . That would help . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1089	s	I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data ; Yeah . ; because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting ; and we 're already short on disk space .
Bed015_2029	b	Yeah . ; Can can we , uh What are the generalizations , and stuff ? ; Connect the dots . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_368	s	Oh , yeah . ; They 're very good . ; It would you know , it would real really mean that we should do short meetings when you turn off the turn off the air conditioning , ; Carbon monoxide poisoning ?
Bed011_930	s	Sure . ; I mean from my point of view I 'm I 'm trying to care about the syntax , so you know ; Well that too , ; but um You know if th if we in if we you know , make sure that we get them talking about temporal order .
Bmr019_708	b	and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , ; where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that ; things like words that do occur just by themselves a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it ; Yeah .
Bmr015_532	b	Yeah , well , your example was really ; information on the microphones , ; i ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_1291	b	I don't know if I did one . ; so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself . ; Wow . ; Hmm .
Bro008_21	s	But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later . ; But it looks like , um ; M yeah . ; You know most of the time , even I mean even though it 's true that the overall number for Danish we didn't improve it
Bed002_1273	s	and we plug it in , ; and then for these certain tasks , ; and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system , ; it all all of a sudden it does much better .
Bmr021_349	s	and then ; Oops ! ; And then I check , you know , if this works , ; so , you can use the the shell " AND " operator or something .
Bmr014_917	s	So so so ; Yeah . ; I 'm sorry ; so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it .
Bmr006_1317	b	It seems like that would be pretty strong . ; Yeah . Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_659	bk	The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , ; I think we saw in it today , ; and it was about six point six percent . ; Oh .
Bmr030_567	h	so we can get the files to it , ; but ; Yep . ; Uh ,
Bed015_1010	s	OK , so well that 's ; should we flip over to the other side officially then ? ; Mm - hmm , hmm . ; I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it .
Bed002_184	bk	Right . ; And uh , just give me a call , ; which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . ; Yep .
Bmr010_1317	b	That is to say , use , you know , as as you 're doing with the speech , uh , nonspeech , use some very general features . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , then , uh , look at it more from the aspect of modeling . ; Yeah .
Bro013_109	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um . But just train those H M Ms using different features , ; the features coming from our Aurora stuff . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2345	s	Maybe it 's like saying like , " This is funny ; Do you ; but maybe it shouldn't be funny " ; or " This is funny
Bns002_1154	ba	If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects , it 's , in principle , then the same . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's O K .
Bmr013_934	s	One question , ; e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? ; No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , ; like if there 's one speaker in there , that says " OK " or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it ,
Bed009_111	b	I dunno ; w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ? ; It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand uh better what 's going on . ; Yes .
Bmr018_1133	s	Well , yeah , it it 's probably wouldn't make sense , ; Or some or some ; but ; I mean , I would see Eurospeech if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions .
Bmr029_213	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it 'd be really great if it was all automatic , but I think that , you know , given the pressure of time , if i i ; I mean , since you 're gonna find out in a short amount of time , that 's great .
Bmr019_44	b	Yeah . ; If we 're very ; Forced align . ; Yeah .
Bed016_239	s	everth ; Oh , you 've got the parser done . ; Sorry . ; That 's the not the construction parser .
Bmr015_262	b	and ; OK , good . ; so it 's ; Yeah .
Bro024_593	b	It 's not written anywhere . ; Yeah , it 's TI - digits . ; The first r spreadsheet is TI - digits . ; Mmm .
Bns003_221	%--	I believe , it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; I I think it doesn't
Bns003_862	g	It d yeah . ; I think uh , there are in a certain degree some alignment with with both of you guys , ; Yeah . ; right ?
Btr001_1133	aap	cuz we could probably move it one hour later , ; In m ; I mean I think , u unless ; I was just gonna say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit
Bro027_609	aa	because ; Could that help a little bit ? ; I mean , I guess there 's a lot of things you could do to ; Yeah .
Btr001_363	s	they ; and then everyone would say , " What was that again ? " ; Oh , eh ; and then they 'd pronounce it in English
Bmr026_101	s	and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll ; Oh , OK , OK . ; I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . ; Yeah , I haven't done that .
Bro004_1424	s	They have a they have a thing for doing that ; and th they have for awhile , in H T ; Yeah ? ; And you can parallelize the training .
Bro007_375	s	and these ; Right . ; But the question is when when do we fix the system , ; But we could
Btr002_824	b	cuz you 've already gotten the first part . ; Right ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro007_378	s	But we could ; do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ? ; it d ; I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah .
Bed014_509	aa	although there are some that will need to be there . ; Good . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr001_324	s	right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ; So I guess this a pretty dense group
Bro018_141	%--	Yeah . ; And so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch ; and she 's saying ; you know trying
Bns002_847	s	like for example , an automatic , uh acknowledgement . ; Some protocols used uh in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet some of them use , an eh acknowledge from the receiver , ; which is also a short packet , ; so you you are getting some kind of link layer uh acknowledgement scheme
Bed003_1551	b	and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . ; That feed into those ? ; Nah ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1678	s	yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet . ; So we have to figure out the neural nets , I guess . ; Yeah . ; The uh , other thing I was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net ,
Bed017_334	s	That 's definitely a job for artificial intelligence . ; uh , or ; Well that 's not not even something humans ; Except for humans can't really solve it either , so .
Bdb001_1110	s	or ; Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes . ; And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , uh , you know , anchored , clear . ; And it would just end up on a separate ribbon .
Bro017_763	s	That 's what you do . ; That 's what you do , you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained . ; Yeah . ; Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model , you put a constant .
Bns002_78	s	also about routing in such kind of networks ; and , eh , I will make some comments also about uh the current standards of wireless local area networks ; and finally , I will present the blueprint of of my research project or my research uh proposal here . ; So the first thing is eh what an ad - hoc network is .
Bro019_843	aa	Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing . ; I mean maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first . ; That 's wh ; Yeah .
Bed002_843	%--	b y ; You don't ; there . ; That 's
Bmr005_1157	s	She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . ; I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . ; So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . ; It won't be that many people who do it that often ,
Bed014_1140	s	Um . ; It 's more general ; You know , so it 's a m minimal change . ; Only have to change one vowel .
Bed015_1879	b	which is that , um , ; it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . ; Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n ; Mmm .
Bmr007_138	s	Yeah . ; Normalized to how much ; it would be good to normalize with respect to that . ; Now on the table I did take one step toward , uh away from the raw frequencies by putting , uh percentages .
Bed006_1809	b	I In fact if you just tell me like you know like two examples ; Yeah . ; I mean , y ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_170	bk	I understand what you mean . ; Yeah . ; And then displayed . ; Right .
Bsr001_521	s	I think he 's about to pass out . ; That 's why ; U i ; You guys gave up too soon .
Bro011_687	s	Yeah . ; how much better can you make it ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation
Bro011_435	s	Mm - hmm . ; but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable .
Bro008_119	s	Uh , and and , uh , they both did very well , ; Uh - huh . ; you know ? ; So , um , my impression is they also did very well on on the the , uh , evaluation set ,
Bmr008_1597	bk	I I ; OK , so so I think I mean , @ @ this is something to to experimentally determine , ; This is ; Yeah .
Bmr011_586	s	or have whoever 's interested ; save that data out , ; transfer it there , ; it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . I think .
Bro026_376	s	We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA . ; And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . ; But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . ; But there 's one difference .
Bro026_1077	s	Hmm . ; So , I mean , that 's i ; Right . We can't we can't get it at all without any language models . ; Language models are there and important
Bmr010_1109	s	Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks . ; No . ; But what I mean is ; Oh , I shouldn't say it that way
Bns002_920	%--	because what you cannot avoid is , uh ; to p l the part of the of the radio frequency power you have to transmit . ; I mean , this is this cannot be avoided . ; But what you can avoid or you can reduce
Bro027_1911	b	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Well , maybe . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1834	aa	Yeah . ; From each language to the superset , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah .
Bmr018_1680	s	But th you know , the same thing has happened in computational linguistics , ; right ? ; You look at the ACL papers coming out , and now there 's sort of a turn back towards , OK we 've learned statistic ; you know , we 're basically getting what we expect out of some statistical methods ,
Bmr005_155	x	I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " in that in that context , ; Well ; Yeah . ; I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .
Bns002_1205	s	which w will use uh orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ; OK . ; and will get probably twenty - five megabits per second . ; eh but , again , the will move to five gigahertz ,
Bro005_165	%--	And I try to combine different type of feature , ; but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database ; because never help to increase the accuracy . ; Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table ,
Bed016_645	s	Right . ; Depends . ; But Like , " run into an old friend " , it probably needs its own construction . ; I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else
Bro025_106	s	But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth , ; um , that arguably , you 're c ; and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand . ; There 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , uh , do spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering ,
Bro014_115	b	So you you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a ; So I ; Uh , I I have to look to see what the exact numbers were . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_199	b	Yeah . ; OK , so let 's give that a try ; OK . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ? ; OK .
Btr002_3338	b	So we are for ; " QUAL " is used for things like " whispered " , or " said while laughing " , or things of that nature . ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_920	bk	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and ; Bad . ; Right .
Bro025_681	b	if you guys had run into problems . ; So , Hynek is coming back next week , you said ? ; Yeah , that 's the plan . ; Hmm .
Bed015_1358	s	In in our s in our in our ; Yeah . ; Situation . Right , right . ; in in our in our s terminology , " want " can be an action
Bmr003_2475	%--	right ? ; Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way ; Yeah . ; and and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev
Bro008_362	s	but the driving conditions , I mean the speed and the kind of road , is different for training and testing , ; is that right ? ; Yeah . ; And the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing .
Btr001_2175	aa	I was wondering . ; I do it . ; Really ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr002_434	s	And so tha uh if that would help , uh I 'm certainly willing to donate them . ; Well , ; I 'm I 'm open to ; the d the well , the uh The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software .
Bro027_539	s	Uh ; Plus the frame , ; t If you are using three frames ; so it 's two - twenty .
Bed005_1207	s	No , no . ; So , " Noisy - OR " is a funny way of referring to this , ; because the Noisy - OR is only one instance . ; Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore .
Btr001_256	%--	um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language ; and ; But ; And I found that I could
Btr001_1453	s	because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either ; so it 's it 's audiotape .
Bed010_430	co	And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape
Bmr020_670	s	" yeah " , ; " how about them sports teams ? " ; Anyway . ; So the paper 's on - line
Bmr024_175	aa	or ; Yeah . ; As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum that goes with that number . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_159	s	But when that happens , then that pie will get even closer to the midline . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's not quite not quite fifty percent
Buw001_1471	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Give them a reward , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1233	s	So , whenever the Right now , the s the scoring is based on segments . ; Um , which is not great ; because , for instance ; So so , the the other way to do the scoring is using a a NIST format called STM . S
Bed013_456	s	And I just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence , " Where is the Powder - Tower " , ; Mm - hmm . ; and we we p pretend to parse it , ; we pretend to understand it ,
Bns001_105	s	So , ; for example , routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched ; but it has an important background . ; But mobile network this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer ,
Bed006_911	bk	I don't know if this answers your question , ; I was just staring at this while you were talking , ; sorry . ; It 's OK .
Buw001_2200	s	So , um , ; I ; I really liked the idea of ; what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech .
Bmr021_618	ba	to change MR to MRM at all places at ICSI . ; Yeah , ; that 'd be great . ; Really enjoy that .
Bro027_1951	b	I d I d I just have the SpeechDat - Car right now , ; Yeah . ; so ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1779	g	Yeah . ; Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . ; If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , ; you know
Bro018_176	s	Um . ; So so don't uh don't do the division , ; but let the net have everything . ; That 's another thing you could do
Bed003_371	s	so one thing I I 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the " admission fee " thing set up . ; So one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this , ; Uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , ; but you could see perhaps discus the " admission fee " going directly to the mode pointing at " Enter " ,
Bro021_1060	bk	no ? ; Yeah . ; That one 's right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_766	%	The fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever , neurological neuro neuro - biol su stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I guess four pages you could ; I mean you could definitely it 's definitely possible to do it .
Bro003_983	qw	So , ; um ; Yeah , ; so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training ?
Bed009_948	b	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Sure , ; Oh yes . ; right .
Bed011_1056	b	Yeah . ; but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like , ; so ; yeah .
Bro023_1522	s	because it 's it 's the FTT bins . ; And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile , ; when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate , ; If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics .
Bro018_1143	b	Yeah , ; so that was the SRI system . ; Maybe you 're right . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_863	bk	Yeah , he 's been setting stuff up and going away . So . ; That 's a good point . ; I see . ; Good point good point .
Bro027_65	aa	But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? ; What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ? ; At twenty hertz . ; Yeah ,
Buw001_745	s	Yeah . ; But ; Also CMU has been doing this ; and they were the most vocal at this meeting ,
Bmr024_863	%--	Yeah . ; We could always put more disks on . ; Yeah . ; It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci
Btr002_1251	s	So , two people did that , i um , I thought . ; I did it a little . ; Did you do it ? ; I thought so .
Bro017_920	b	but you just tune the model . ; So . You have your features . ; You train your your model on these features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_856	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent . ; So ; Right .
Bro018_638	%--	Actually you don't get a you don't get a nice number between zero and one . ; You get you get either a zero or a one . ; Um , uh ; there are there are pap
Bmr031_708	s	We could go to thirty - five . ; So we could get some extra space out of that . ; But the s right now the server 's full . ; We couldn't add any more disks .
Bro003_594	bk	But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there . ; Yeah , ; and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning , ; Oh .
Btr002_712	s	Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something . ; Or just uh s ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I remember I had one . One with that and it was just , al all the time . ; Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely .
Bmr024_330	bk	What about just actually doing recognition ? ; Well , we we know what they read , because we have the forms . ; No , they make mistakes . ; Right .
Bro005_241	s	Uh , so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent . ; Ninety . ; Yeah . ; Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together ,
Bed008_882	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK , good . ; That definitely interes ; Yep .
Bmr008_1570	%--	Right . ; because it 's no my my algorithm . ; Yeah . So ordinarily in these things , it does tell you that it 's it 's voiced with a pitch of such - and - such . ; Is
Bmr013_520	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA .
Bdb001_212	bk	Right . ; Or or there 's a there 's a particular way in XML to refer to external resources . ; And ; OK .
Bro023_404	%--	OK . ; So ; Sorry . ; So , with the with the on - line normalization , the performance was , um , ten
Bro014_577	%--	if i ; m s Yeah , ; but ; Well , let 's say for ins
Bmr005_208	co	Right . ; Uh . ; Oh , but you 'd have the ; Put Morgan always like this
Bed003_41	co	I 'm sorry I ; Well , I mean , just to ; OK . ; Introduce .
Bmr006_1693	2	Yeah ? ; I mean , how would you say that ? ; I mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef ; if you wanted to anonymize .
Bro003_849	s	Or ; Yeah . ; so we can go ahead and corrupt other things . ; I 'm just curious , Carmen
Bmr026_729	b	Right . ; So if we did that ; Well , except that we keep going for our full time . ; Yep .
Bmr011_1729	no	Hmm ? ; but who knows ? ; Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want ; I don't know .
Bmr014_1175	%--	But it the ; some something might sometime , and they uh ; if if it 's something that they said , they might ; i i
Bro003_1856	fa	But I don't know if TIMIT o how is TIMIT . ; So , I mean ; What ; I 'm sorry .
Bed009_871	ba	Yeah . ; And e ; Yeah , OK . ; Good point .
Bed006_431	b	And people talking about pictures and pictorial representations ; Hmm . ; and um ; Right .
Bmr009_338	s	and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of of people that can overlap .
Bmr014_1136	s	But I don't know how else to do it . ; I also have this ; I I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , ; I mean I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here ,
Bsr001_454	b	Yeah . ; You won't be able to do anything . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed010_788	s	Yeah , right . ; I I mean it 's kind of ; Mm - hmm . ; Very kind of you stop back and suddenly it goes away
Btr002_620	s	Good . I I that was my impression also . ; That 's that 's what I th ; It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones . ; And actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora , they did run into limitations
Bmr007_487	b	I mean , if a truck goes rolling past , adults will well , depending , but mostly , adults will will will hold off to what to finish the end of the sentence till the till the noise is past . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I think we generally do monitor things like that , about whether we whether our utterance will be in the clear or not . ; Right .
Bed017_82	s	That was that . ; Um , ; the uh , ; uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism
Bed003_214	s	Yep . ; And uh , so we ; Reasons being , you know , it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that . ; If we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort , uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped .
Bro014_387	aa	So not ; So not try to combine them . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_45	co	th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this , ; in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says " OK . " ; Really ? ; So , we 're starting right now .
Bmr019_1091	s	It is different . ; but I 'm gonna try it . ; In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now , ; not the full paper .
Bmr018_304	bk	Like that . ; But those would be those would be ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh !
Bed003_944	aa	Hmm . ; Maybe you can read in ? ; Ha - So have you used JavaBayes a lot ? ; Yes .
Bro023_951	aa	Hmm . ; Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either , ; right ? ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr016_1490	s	maybe with some of them , uh , they 'd end up being " uh 's " ; but , uh , I my spot - checking has made me think that we do have " eh " in also , um , American e e data represented here . ; But ; any case , that 's the this is reduced down from really quite a long a much longer list ,
Bro012_1161	%--	Yeah , yeah , ; well , go go on . ; Uh , I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , um by looking at um , you know , uh I guess harmonics ; or looking across time
Bmr005_153	%	Yeah . ; And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face . ; I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " in that in that context , ; Well
Bed015_1354	s	So so , " want " itself can be i i i i i ; u ; Can be just another frame that 's part of your ; Well , and it i basically it 's an action .
Bmr028_1602	b	Well , I was just wondering if i i ; Because I I am finding that , um , in double checking , I 've run across , u um , one data set where the microphone was off early on , ; and then two other speakers their microphones went off later . ; Hmm .
Bmr002_1122	bk	on on the transcript , ; so there may be ; it may be worthwhile to at least try a little bit to combine the channels . ; Right .
Bns003_328	s	I don't know a good word for it , ; should we use uh " new comers " ; or ; So , with somebody who is new , arriving here , or wants to to , uh , send an application ?
Bmr030_178	qw	How much memory does he have ? ; No . I didn't have any problems ; I 'm sorry ? ; How much memory does he have ?
Bmr021_46	s	um . And that that 's easy ; and that will certainly work . ; The other option is to try yet another mike . ; Find one we like and potentially get six , all the same .
Bmr021_198	ba	Yeah , eighty or ninety for the Shures . ; Yeah . ; So . ; But they were they seemed pretty good .
Bmr031_561	s	if we collect say a hundred meetings ; and each meeting is just the audio , ; compressed audio 's half a gig , ; so there 's fifty gigs just for our corpus .
Bro011_766	s	that 's perfect . ; Yeah . ; Great ! ; OK , guess we 're done .
Bro003_596	s	and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning , ; Oh . ; when really they 're both silence . ; I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six .
Bro024_1300	d	and ; Yeah . ; Mmm ; So there are like some some s some parameters you wanted to use or something ?
Buw001_2256	s	and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , ; so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it ; because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project . ; But , um , it 's definitely something I would want to do something on .
Bro018_456	qo	Um . Tsk . ; Then uh I talked a little bit about um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events , ; and um we 're we 're we 're thinking about a way to test the completeness of a a set of um dynamic uh events . ; Uh , completeness in the in the sense that um if we if we pick these X number of acoustic events , do they provide sufficient coverage for the phones that we 're trying to recognize or or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .
Bro014_1254	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation . ; And I call that lies because you don't really have that ,
Buw001_2167	bk	They didn't have to collect it . ; " Psst . Want to buy a corpora ? " ; Of course it 's not " found " in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . ; Yeah . OK , OK .
Bmr030_697	s	The demo was one of them . ; Demo and IBM , I think . ; Demo . ; Yeah , that 's it .
Bmr003_887	bk	And then then w since we need some statistics do it three more . ; OK . ; And so you 'll get you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done . ; Oh , yeah .
Bro017_883	b	and you put your data in power higher than one . ; Then it becomes more important . In the overall score , I believe . ; But don't you have to do something to the mean , also ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr028_436	b	Find everything that should be bleeped . ; That 's right . Th - we do have that bi nice marker is that , n n ; because we all know we 're being recorded , whenever anyone says anything like that , we then have a conversation about bleeping it out . ; Right .
Bro004_722	qy	Yeah . ; and make some strong decisions for what we 're gonna do testing on before next week . ; Yeah I ; So do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this ,
Btr002_719	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Especially if they also got louder too , and they hit it , ; Y y yeah .
Bro016_895	b	it breaks . ; You know , ; so it 's ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1143	b	because , you know , then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bns001_1558	bk	Yeah . ; I never eh e um dealed with um mobile communications . ; So why not ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_1568	aa	So . ; So . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1023	s	But for instance you could imagine instead of having ; I I changed the name of um it used to be " entities " . ; So you see it 's " scenario " , " referent " and " discourse segment " . ; And " scenario " is essentially what kind of what 's the basic predication ,
Btr002_2429	b	Heard that one . ; Oh , I see . ; I just make a mouth ; Huh .
Bed013_99	s	And make it more robust , ; maybe learn new things . ; And um , ; so there 's no no end of potential things one could get out of it , if that works .
Bed006_812	b	that 's a whole entit ; That 's a block , ; That 's a block , ; yeah .
Bsr001_1999	s	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; Mmm . ; I mean , just just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that .
Bed010_638	b	So that would be " origin " in English , ; The origin . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2529	qrr	OK . ; Alright . ; I wanted to ask about also the air conditioning . ; Are uh , is there a plan to to turn the air conditioning off in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on ?
Bro028_637	aa	I I don't get any mail about ; I have to say , there 's uh something funny - sounding about saying that one of these big companies doesn't have enough cup compute power do that , ; so they 're having to have it done by Mississippi State . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1078	b	Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's uh two things then . ; Mmm .
Bmr016_747	aa	Oh right . ; So let 's do that off - line , ; we don't need to do it during the meeting . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_455	bk	OK . ; And we know that there 's th that 's not a very g ; I mean , we miss a lot of them , ; Yeah .
Bro018_1218	b	And it wasn't trained on this task . ; Actually one percent is sort of you know , sort of in a reasonable range . ; People would say " yeah , I could I can imagine getting that " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_164	b	Well , we got a a video projector in here , ; uh , ; and , uh which we keep on during every every session we record , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_220	co	So we have ; Mm - hmm . ; Sorry , ; Go ahead .
Btr002_3300	s	And , um , ; i g ; that 's that 's this is just to mention an instance that happened once , ; it 's really grasping for details .
Bed014_917	2	subgroup meetings ; s you know , other other ; No , you Uh , people in this group connecting with with ; Those people who happen to be around .
Bmr011_732	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You don't you don't have to leave for it . ; But I just
Bro021_662	%--	Oh . ; OK . ; Uh , ; so there 's
Bmr011_652	b	Yeah . ; So , I 'm kinda skeptical , ; but um I think that ; Mmm .
Bro007_228	s	I don't remember . ; Um it 's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets ; About ? ; and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least .
Bed003_645	s	Um . ; Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Like , we totally hand - tuned the probabilities ,
Bro021_942	s	We have first that , for example , X is equal , ; uh ; Well . ; This is the frequency domain
Bro014_492	s	in the highly - mismatched that happens " . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , ; you should see , uh , a gentle degradation through that .
Bns002_923	s	But what you can avoid or you can reduce ; and probably ; because now it is the main factor , the main consumption factor , is the logic inside . ; In the same way , at as as it happened with with processors , for example .
Bmr005_490	%--	And It 's right . ; Yeah . ; But the problem is the following . ; The the the
Bmr031_1192	ba	Yeah . ; So we weren't quite sure which whether the difference came from different transcripts , for instance . ; And so Thilo 's ; So , it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation , when you have the the manual segmentations ,
Bro003_1925	b	Yeah , but you will ask the net to put one for th th the phoneme class ; Yeah . ; and So . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1154	bk	Right . ; Yes . ; So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions . ; Right .
Bmr019_1063	s	So that 's good news , really . ; even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting , ; but we 'll find out anyway . ; We were I guess the other thing we 're we 're I should say is that we 're gonna , um try compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard ,
Bed015_234	co	And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types . ; Oh , one thing I should mention is about " designates " . ; I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . ; So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block .
Bmr014_252	%--	Yeah . ; As professionally as I guess you can get it done . ; Well , it could ; if they do a lot of it , it 's
Bro023_1646	s	Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping ; because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that " below the threshold , I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum " . ; And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum . ; So it would be like frame dropping ,
Bmr005_174	s	OK . ; So I was just realizing we 've You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again . ; I believe it . ; Yeah . Actually to make it worse , uh , Morgan uses " you " and " you "
Bns003_909	d	for instance , to have initial meeting either here or in Europe or or wherever . ; I 've , uh , contact one more time the professor , ; what is his name ? ; Rao ?
Bed013_1380	b	and um , ; in the literature there 's " bank " ; and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1709	aa	those kind of vo vocal cues . ; And sometimes even laughs . ; Yeah , breath - laughs especially . ; Oh , yeah .
Bmr013_1	%	 ;  ; So , uh ; Alright .
Bmr025_704	s	And I have uh so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , ; and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . ; On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . ; So you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk , kaplunk .
Bro011_51	s	What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? ; So we had ; I forget . ; So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling .
Bed011_829	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Money is no object , ; or you say " I just want to spend enough " .
Bed009_1114	s	and about the situation about " Is it raining ? " ; I don't know . ; Whatever it is . ; And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out .
Bro014_1058	s	That 's right . ; And then you just , uh , compute differences ; Yeah . ; I have here one example if you if you want see something like that .
Bro024_802	aa	And and I was thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problems in the especially in the multi - condition training mode . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Th - That 's true . Yeah
Bed009_652	s	I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants . ; One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user . ; You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something . ; And so y you would like it t also be able to uh formulate a query .
Bro028_615	b	Did they say anything on the conference call about , um , how the Wall Street Journal part of the test was going to be run ? ; Because I I thought I remembered hearing that some sites were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff at their place , ; No . ; Mmm .
Bro021_852	s	How do you say ? ; I will read because it 's better for my English . ; I i given ; is the estimate of the PDF of the noise signal
Bns001_976	s	because I don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this . ; I don't know what what carriers are planning to do about this . ; I 'm not really sure , ; but I thought I I had the impression that we can throw away our Nokia stuff when our web gateways , when we g even go to GPRS ,
Bmr022_573	s	an expert can't even tell what they 're talking about . ; Yeah . ; Um , so that 's OK . ; Just map that to reject
Bro023_1626	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; I don't estimate the f noise on the ten frames but use his estimate .
Bed002_140	s	Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . ; Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . ; And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , ; and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes ,
Btr001_1461	s	Hmm , wow . ; And they type it on ; Makes it really hard . ; and then then it comes back to us
Bmr022_460	s	More beeps than that . ; I was thinking there was on the order of fifteen hundred segments , ; but maybe I 'm ; There must be .
Bed009_404	s	And it 's th that 's completely um encapsulated from th the dialogue system . ; That 's simply a functionality that you give data as in a query ; and then you get back from that mmm , a functioning model um which might be a planner or a VCR or whatever . ; um some result and that 's then then used .
Bmr011_1282	b	and you have people talking naturally . ; And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bro024_855	%--	It 's just a constant , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I think e
Bed004_109	%--	And um . ; The reading was five minutes , exactly . ; And now comes the ; This is the phone - in phase of
Bsr001_1639	s	So . ; Or , I mean is the intention to do some som ; I think ; Well , we 'll definitely need to do both .
Bro014_454	b	that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance , ; you know , with again gentle degregra degradation , ; um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training . ; Hmm .
Bro021_1124	b	well , we know this statistic ; and we know the noisy st ; well , we can apply first order of the vector st Taylor series of the of the of well , the order that we want , increase the complexity of the problem . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_686	co	and you 'll do the recognition . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And at that time I said , you know , we said , " don't worry about the the compute power " .
Bmr010_1172	%--	So it it 's got its own objective criterion . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough ; I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back back when Chuck was here
Bed003_509	s	So we can either be in a hurry or not , ; but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ? ; Well , we ; To do that we would add another uh value for that .
Bmr008_1194	s	Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub ; I don't know what you would call them , but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have ; Sure , absolutely . ; but You know , as long as we have this one place where it can all be stored , then we 're fine , I think .
Bro010_964	s	And ; Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , uh , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . ; Mm - hmm . ; So he hasn't applied it to recognition
Bed015_930	no	Just with a different foc focus constituent ? ; Yeah , I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of , ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't know
Bmr020_339	ar	That was that was one set of results , ; and then the second one was just basically the the stuff we had in the in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance . ; Hmm . ; Nope .
Bed002_137	s	and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . ; So that 's my particular interest , ; is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . ; Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings .
Bns001_440	s	or ; Now , I would like not to hear only three opinions . ; Hm ; But maybe there are also other opinions .
Bmr005_1450	s	So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly . ; What about Joachim , maybe he can ; But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . ; And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio .
Bed017_272	b	Hmm . ; And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . ; And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , ; Uh - huh .
Bed002_1244	%--	I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . ; Now , um Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . ; And so that we have it . ; And then um Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along ,
Bmr006_824	b	Yeah , be ; Yeah , that 's fine . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro003_718	%	But , uh , ; well , ; not for the the ANN . ; I mean
Bmr026_1231	s	How bi how big ; Let 's see . ; What am I trying to think of ? ; The The net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units
Bdb001_550	b	and and But I imagine that those are things that would well , you guys mentioned this , that could span any ; it could be in its own channel , ; it could span time boundaries of any type , ; Right .
Bro022_979	s	Mmm . ; Well , it until now , it doesn't seem to help . ; But ; We 'll see .
Btr001_2303	b	Or giving permission ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed010_1083	b	Right . ; Um , But anyway , yeah . ; Pretty soon . ; OK .
Bmr030_361	d	Great . ; It really helped a lot to have that . ; So , um , you know , there were a l ; Much faster than doing everything alone .
Btr001_1451	b	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1130	bs	I mean , that not for the topic of this meeting . ; But let me just ; No . ; W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon ,
Bed009_1122	b	But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that , ; Yeah , ; just about the um ; oh yeah ,
Bed003_377	g	Versus pointing to just at " tourist " , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ?
Bed011_617	g	Entertainment is a good one in there , I think . ; I agree . ; So , business is supposed to uh , be sort of it like professional type stuff , ; right ,
Bmr016_1827	b	You add it to the dictionary . ; which normally would be an acronym , ; you know , " TCL " ; Right .
Bro027_755	b	I mean , I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , ; but ; but ; Yeah .
Bed003_920	bk	This is fine , ; Oh no . ; this business . ; Right .
Bmr027_91	bk	That 's why . ; Oh , I see . ; You said you wanted it to be available then . ; OK .
Bmr009_478	%--	But ; as well . ; Yeah . ; It just
Bed006_671	%--	And they 're gonna be , you know , fleshed out in in their real ugly detail , ; Source - Path - Goal , ; and there 's gonna be s a lot of stuff on the Goal and blah - blah - blah , that a goal can be and so forth . ; What we think is
Bed003_1477	%--	right ? ; One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that ; Yeah . ; and sort of
Bmr006_1000	b	Yeah , yeah . ; what it 's doing , even You know it 's ; Uh , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's ; Yep .
Bmr008_1052	s	when they say , here 's you ID , ; don't forget it . ; Oh yeah , that 's bad . ; So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate .
Bmr031_1289	s	uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , because one of Mari 's students was to wants to do some language modeling for , uh , predicting overlaps and , uh , stuff like that .
Bmr021_208	%	Right , right . ; So . ; So we should buzz that out if we send the data to Sony . ; Ah , come on .
Bmr016_1784	aa	Right . ; Yeah you never would put " tickle " in the language model in that form , ; Right . ; yeah .
Bmr029_23	s	And in talking this morning with , uh , Chuck and with Dave one thought was to use ; We couldn't remember how different the numbers were , ; but if you just worked with males only and used the short training there 're there 're ; uh , I think Chuck 's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff , it took maybe a day and a half
Bro014_1495	%--	We like we we 're we 're ; w we are we 're in the , uh , Bourlard - Hermansky - Morgan , uh , frame of mind . ; Yeah , we like high error rates . ; It 's
Btr001_2049	bk	Li - it was Liz 's idea , ; wasn't it ? ; That was Liz 's idea . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_472	bk	Yeah . It ; Yeah . ; I I I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion with them . ; OK .
Bmr019_1267	s	So I can have two foreground speakers , ; you know , Morgan an and um , Adam and Jane could all be talking , ; and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time , ; and then look where they are relative to each other ,
Bro007_544	b	and ; oh , but uh we don't have time . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bro027_516	%--	which is , ; One hundred milliseconds for smoothing . ; um ; So it 's @ @
Bns002_1170	s	One of them , and probably the most popular , is uh l what we call the " infrastructure mode " , ; where you have a set of mobile nodes , ; and then you have one or more access points . ; These access points are uh in fact providing the eh required connectivity from the mobiles to the network to the m wired network ,
Bmr031_319	s	So there 'll be somebody from the CMU , and somebody from here , and somebody from , uh , a a number of places . ; Probably somebody from UW . ; Um . So . ; Yeah , it 's possible they 'll open it up to more people .
Bmr019_12	s	Oh , could you close the door , maybe ? ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; Two items , which was , uh , digits and possibly stuff on on , uh , forced alignment ,
Bro024_420	aa	So that was all I had , for now . ; Yeah . ; Do you wanna go , Barry ? ; Yeah ,
Bro017_1000	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_967	%	OK . ; Yeah . Um , I think that 's right . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro023_413	bk	But the ; I mean , even the medium mismatch is pretty much the same . ; And the high mismatch was improved by twenty percent absolute . ; OK ,
Bmr018_639	s	it was transcribed incorrectly , ; something really bad happened , ; OK . ; and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was .
Bed011_1132	s	And ; " Action planning " meaning " Discourse Modeling " ? ; Yes . ; And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that module a dis disc dialogue manager ,
Bro007_172	b	Yep . ; yeah ? ; And and that looks like an interesting one too . ; Mmm yeah .
Bro024_821	s	Then I tried the same exactly the same spectral subtraction algorithm on these Aurora tasks ; and it simply doesn't work . ; Hmm . ; It 's even it , uh , hurts even .
Bro022_730	aa	That 's right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's ; Yeah .
Bro011_327	qw	so ; Yeah . ; uh what are the variables , ; what we 're calling this one ,
Bmr012_103	co	And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera . ; Mm - hmm . ; We we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on ; so if you don't know what to put just leave it blank .
Bro005_100	s	Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . ; Uh , so this is training the net on French only , ; or on English only , ; and testing on Italian .
Bmr007_1086	b	Yeah . ; Ah . ; Just , kept ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1315	s	Exactly . ; Strict . ; because the ; Oh , now it 's out in the public ,
Bmr008_1683	aa	It seems like with the overlaps being fairly long , that should make it easier . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right ,
Bro014_963	b	both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then , uh , th you know , structural reasons , ; uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said , ; that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_266	b	Yeah . As long as you 're aware that you 're doing that , that 's I don't see that as a problem . ; You can separate it out and see how if they 're ; And then s s similarly with subject matter . ; Yeah .
Bro011_250	s	and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation ; but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use ; so I have to I have to read it more , ; I don't really understand what he 's doing yet .
Btr002_2702	s	Yeah . ; Ex - exactly . Exactly . ; Yeah . ; A lot of people go ,
Bed015_1536	b	Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So so again , this uh , this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff ; and t because you know , " Fred said that Mary said " , and whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1324	s	Huh . ; Um , ; Oops . ; The mean is different with it ,
Buw001_976	b	Oh , OK . That 's fine . ; Absolutely . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_380	aa	Cuz we wouldn't have the correct node . ; Basically , w what you 're s proposing is a n Where - Is node , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1039	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; It 'll still probably be worse . ; I mean , it 's it 'd be context independent and so on .
Bdb001_1352	s	Mm - hmm . ; extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours , ; and use that . ; And then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between .
Bmr016_865	b	Well the ; Then put it all on scratch ; because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup . ; Yeah .
Bro021_107	b	well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when if the utterance is , uh , long enough to to continue to adapt after , like , one second ; Mm - hmm . ; or ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_667	s	Oh , OK , so ; yeah as long as you have ; I mean , w we sort of discussed one way or the other , ; and it doesn't matter to me .
Bmr009_971	b	Sure . ; But . ; So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1859	s	which is that , uh , the the stuff that you 've been describing , Jane , I gu one has to , of course indicate , um , i is very interesting , ; Alright . ; and ; I I 'd like to be able to to pore through , you know , the the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that .
Bro014_1402	ar	And and , uh ; Would you would you wanna do this kind of , uh , difference thing after you do spectral subtraction ? ; Uh , maybe . ; No .
Bro026_677	s	But if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all , um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , uh , if their strategies do , then ; Mm - hmm . ; So is this , uh ? ; Uh , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks .
Bro019_571	aa	I th ; because I don't know I uh , I don't exactly know what are your results ? ; But , ; OK .
Bns003_872	b	maybe it 's a separation , in principle , that I do not use the normal traditional , uh , data forwarding pass and update , in principle , only the routing information uh , to to to use it . ; But y ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2325	bk	You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones . ; But you need the room and the set up . ; Right , ; OK .
Bro014_1236	b	More close . Is this ? ; And this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_632	b	There are other things that we finally were shown to improve also ; like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_714	t3	I don't know . ; Uh , what is a CrossPad ? ; So it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . ; Thank you .
Buw001_1652	aa	OK . ; So then just email you ? ; So y ; Sure , sure , sure .
Btr001_242	s	OK . ; That 's interesting . ; Hmm - hmm . ; I can do I can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them
Bro023_948	b	So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be , ; and now i then you 've subtracted it off . ; And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up . ; Hmm .
Bmr021_255	s	so I 've never had to ; Oh really ? ; Yeah . ; Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all .
Btr001_1354	aa	Id - Is ; They don't have like an interface , right ? ; They just ; No .
Btr001_1252	b	yeah , then I 'm doing that right now . ; Right . ; Oh , right , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_565	%--	So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction . ; Hmm . ; Is is it ; We have nothing
Bmr030_882	b	Um , But , uh , ; So so that 's that 's sort of what it is . ; Yep . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_299	co	But , the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate . ; Right . ; And so then it might be alright . ; OK . Let me know .
Bro003_715	h	right ? ; So . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh ,
Bmr002_158	bk	Did we just record all that ? ; Should we start it over ? ; No . ; OK .
Bmr027_849	s	And we actually need a third thing . ; Right . ; I mean ; It 's not that you 've looked at it ,
Bed015_1846	aa	Yeah ? ; Uh . ; M mockery . ; Right .
Bed011_509	s	uh @ @ function , yeah . ; Yeah , this is where ; yeah ; th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah .
Bro005_1329	b	and the training targets , ; and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , ; and , you know , with limited time . ; Yeah .
Bed010_48	s	and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . ; And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . ; And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . ; So , you have a basically , a goal
Bro023_927	qw	And and given all that , you could definitely end up with something that 's negative . ; But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum , um , then it can be bad to have something negative . ; Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ? ; What happens ?
Bro027_1174	b	Because ; Mmm ; Yeah , I mean , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set . ; Hmm .
Bed009_901	%--	Yep . ; and so . ; Right . ; But it it it doesn't look like i you 're using it .
Bmr020_1875	s	Sample it , rather . ; Alright . ; Yeah . ; I think that that will be a little bit of a problem
Bmr005_107	b	so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours ; Mm - hmm . ; and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_224	qw	just sort of to de - emphasize the jarring . ; So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do . ; But then , yeah , the LDA i uh , is interesting because it would sort of say well , suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion , ; what would the filter look like then ?
Btr002_2313	b	Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is , certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other embed uh , in other utterances . ; And , um , you know , it 's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers , ; but well , just the contours , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_447	bk	But there is some kind of function call , ; because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content , but , uh , Confirm in Features ? ; So ; Oh .
Bro018_314	b	Yeah , so the uh ; Uh , the issue is whether people make a decision now based on what they 've already seen , or they make it later . ; And one of the arguments for making it later is let 's make sure that whatever techniques that we 're using work for something more than than connected digits . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_1613	d	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; OK . The the tea is is going , so , uh , I suggest we do , uh uh , a unison . ; A unison digits ?
Bro014_1319	aa	And so you said this is pretty ; doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise ? ; It seems , ; yeah .
Bro005_116	b	So this is the another line another set of lines in the table . ; Ah , yes . ; Uh , @ @ with SPINE ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_304	s	So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names . ; Right . I saw that . ; And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script . ; So there 's this one script that parses waveform names
Btr001_2001	no	Like , I don't mean to , ; but I 'm just kind of going , " I don't know what any of these acronyms are ; Yeah . ; and no idea what you 're talking about . "
Bro016_1167	bk	um , I think they 'll be interesting to talk to , in this sort of issue ; as these detectors are are , uh , developing . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bro003_1516	s	uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives ; and , uh , put them on another another disk rack . ; We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had , ; so we 're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between , uh primarily between this project and the Meetings Meetings Project .
Bro026_273	%--	So the things that we , um , uh , ; I guess we sort of uh , ; There 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for V A ; So , I mean , in
Bmr014_260	bk	Yep . ; That tha that can be quite good . ; Th - this ; Yeah , OK .
Bro010_155	co	Eighty - five . ; Yeah . ; If we want to be very correct , ; so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future .
Bro026_1066	b	Anyway , that 's ; I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . ; You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_317	b	what do you ? " ; And and so they said " well , you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr006_672	b	OK . ; Thank you for your information because I I read . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro004_1244	b	you p put some low level noise or something . ; Probably don't want all zeros . ; Most recognizers don't like zeros ; Hmm .
Bro016_776	no	Yeah . ; so I don ; Well . ; I don't know .
Bro027_789	%	What was that ? ; Say that last part again ? ; So , if you use , like , an IDL VAD , uh , for dropping the frames , ; o o
Bmr021_571	s	I will by next week , though . ; And ; Uh , I don't know about the naming , ; OK . Then I should have made that as an agenda item .
Bmr001_827	s	They should all be in India right now . ; That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are . ; Yeah . ; Not in Scotland .
Bmr027_292	s	And nobody nobody really reads it anyway . ; So . ; And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects , ; Says that .
Bro003_804	aa	Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; They have an accent . ; Yeah they ; they do , yeah .
Bmr006_136	b	Right . ; OK . ; So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . ; Yep .
Bmr011_237	s	Yeah . ; it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view ; Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . ; and also from the research s point of view .
Bmr007_321	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I should also say I did a simplifying , uh count in that if A was speaking B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again , ; I I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap , and it was A being overlapped with by D .
Bro010_992	s	Um , ; so I think that the questioner was right . ; It it was in that sense an unfair test . ; Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , uh , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition ,
Bmr020_1602	aa	That 's that 's really not not normal . ; So so what you 're saying is that nearly always what happens when there 's a problem is that is that uh , there 's some uh , uh nonspeech that uh that is b interpreted as speech . ; That is marked as speech . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1277	aa	uh the co like all of them ? ; Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something ; right ? ; Yep .
Bmr031_1676	s	I 'm really not kidding . ; How they ; They got , like , scuba gear on and , like , hooking them . ; But they didn't tell her .
Bro014_719	qw	because the well - matched case is better . ; Mmm . ; But how much worse since the weighting might change ; how how much worse is it on the other conditions ,
Bed009_791	s	Yeah , that 's right . ; Or wh ; There w ; Oh from from Stuttgart ,
Bmr026_853	s	Right . ; But a fi a fifth is how much ? ; A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something . ; Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was .
Bmr021_416	%--	I don't think so . ; And yeah I mean , that it ; No , no . I mean , if you ; Th - the the the
Bro027_1811	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Be interesting to look at the ; Yeah , ; for the
Bmr013_775	b	Yep . ; We 're gonna be recording them every Monday , ; u ; Yeah .
Bro024_977	s	so the ; OK . ; So the other thing is the I 'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond . ; So I just just tried another sk system I mean , another filter which I 've like shown at the end .
Bro004_445	t3	You had a you had a little ; Uh , No , I don't think so . ; Um What ; These numbers are uh ratio to baseline ?
Bmr006_675	ba	Uh - huh . ; And I have , eh , some ideas . ; Eh , this information is very very useful . ; I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it .
Bmr023_496	s	um , but but ; Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the , uh , uh the the pipeline . ; Yeah . ; Um , we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July ,
Bed002_773	s	And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , ; what what do we need , you know ; Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do ; and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it .
Bmr008_886	s	as long as it 's clear . ; Mm - hmm . ; not where you live . ; I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form .
Bmr018_613	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Those were the non - natives .
Bmr021_1043	aa	Yeah . ; OK . Are we done ? ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_736	b	Mm - hmm . ; in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words ; for for , you know , five word ; Hmm .
Bmr027_959	s	So at some point we need to do that . ; Yeah . ; Well , that 's on my list . ; Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process .
Bed017_542	s	Because , um , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords ; or uh , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh , indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just uh , individual ; Mmm . Mmm . ; So there 's a lot of stuff ,
Bro016_694	no	you know . ; But ; Um . ; I don't know if that would really help ,
Bed005_708	qh	and you know , what what are these things referring to ? ; Not only anaphora , ; but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions , ; and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ?
Bns002_1200	s	OK , DSS . ; OK . ; OK . ; But , in fact , there is an ongoing new version , I think it 's c version - A ,
Bmr009_404	%--	he has the histogram mechanism , ; he has the stuff that subtracts out ; and all he has to do is change it uh uh from from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it . ; And then he should go on and do the other stuff bec
Bed011_1099	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of o our sample sentences , ; the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely .
Btr002_2243	%--	Yeah . ; That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too . ; Mm - hmm . ; In normal conversations , unless it 's very dramatic or very loud ,
Bmr016_2041	b	So , I guess I 'd have one request here ; which is just , um , maybe to make it more robust , ; th that the tag , whatever you would choose for this type of " NUMS " where it 's inside the spontaneous speech , is different than the tag that you use for the read speech . ; Right .
Bmr009_740	b	Good . Good . ; I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News . ; So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think . ; Great !
Bmr025_91	s	DARPA demos , ; we had the submeeting the other day . ; Right , which uh ; So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data
Bro010_153	aa	and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . ; So if we ; Eighty - five . ; Yeah .
Bed015_724	s	So , s ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that the way I we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of ; basically this is the information structure .
Buw001_1546	aa	OK . ; which could be obtained from the text from the transcript . ; Right . Since we have the transcript . ; Yeah .
Btr002_412	s	" Gruesome " . ; Yeah , " grou " uh , " gruesuh " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . It 's both labial at the end .
Bro005_1433	aa	And we 're OK on And we 're OK on disk ? ; to work ; and ; It 's OK , yeah .
Bro011_131	b	so . ; OK . ; Yeah , ; um .
Bdb001_846	b	My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough . ; But ; But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_925	bk	Yeah . It might it might partly just be European summer vacation issues . ; Possibly . It 's been , like , four months , ; so . ; Oh .
Bed002_844	no	You don't ; there . ; That 's ; I don't know .
Bed003_662	s	It 's So we have to like fit the probabilities . ; that 's that 's at ; Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte . ; So , the real case ?
Bmr016_2000	ba	OK . ; i if somebody said something like , " Boy , I 'm really tired , OK . " and then started reading that would be on a separate line ? ; Yes . ; OK great .
Bsr001_2132	b	But , um . ; Hmm ! ; It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1111	aa	I ; So it 's messier . ; The the PDA is messier . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_438	bk	The problem with engineers is " beep . " ; They make funny sounds . ; The o the o the other The other thing is , uh , that we we talked about is give to them uh , burn an extra CD - ROM . ; Yep . Let them have their meeting .
Bmr003_1358	b	Yeah . ; It 's also All the source is available . ; So . ; Right .
Bed015_2218	s	Alright . ; No . ; Oh , you already told me no . ; One ,
Bmr005_466	b	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; In ge in in in a general point of view . ; Oh .
Bmr001_723	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean . ; But I think that 's alright .
Bed006_697	ba	in the future , we may find out that , you know , there 're really s these subtle differences between ; um ; even within the domain of entering in the light of a Source - Path - Goal schema , that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there . ; But it gives us a nice handle .
Bro028_930	%--	Yeah . ; So , ; that 's good . ; So , why don't we just , uh , um
Bro026_875	qy	Mm - hmm . ; And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point . ; Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . ; Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?
Bmr025_230	s	because he did port it to SPRACHcore ; Right . ; so he might have done that already . ; I I I wouldn't be surprised .
Btr002_768	%--	Yeah , that 's ; Especially we have really good headphones , ; when I realized ; like
Bed003_1339	b	But i you know , i we can ; Something Somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we ; um , you know , um still , based on that result is never going to enter that building . ; Hmm .
Bmr021_917	b	And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level . ; You know , so we 'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities . ; OK . ; Alright .
Bmr003_2178	s	Uh if if you ha if you had nothing else . ; But then none of these . ; Right . ; N none of these and no P Z Ms then .
Bmr006_1668	aap	The p It 's a good point , " which what do you do for discourse tracking ? " ; Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . You only eh want to know ; Hmm . ; For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do .
Bro013_474	s	Frame . ; Mm - hmm . ; And what 's th what this ? ; Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum .
Bmr010_1203	s	uh , this this is very possibly a different , uh , topic . ; But , uh , just let me say with reference to this idea of , um , higher - order organization within meetings . ; So like in a ; you know , the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other , uh , uses of the data ,
Bed014_988	s	Is the Speech - Gen meeting still at on Tuesdays ? ; Well , actually we w we we did scrap our Monday time just because Bhaskara couldn't come Monday . ; Hhh . Maybe I do need a Palm Pilot . ; So there 's Nothing 's impeding Monday anymore either .
Btr002_1862	s	And he was going like this at the time . ; Mm - hmm . ; Joel 's like , " I am not amused . " ; I don't even wanna , like , try to repeat what he said
Btr001_2583	s	No , no , let 's not . ; No , you don't ? ; I still don't really know . ; OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth ,
Bro010_47	bk	I 'm sorry ? ; Who is doing that ? ; Uh , us . ; Oh , oh .
Bmr015_841	s	I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them ; Well , but yeah I don't think you can I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame , ; so I mean ; I I mean I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it ,
Bmr020_1707	s	Yep . Mmm . ; But ; But , ; sometimes the the the laptop is in the background
Btr002_740	b	um yeah , ; Yeah . Yeah , yeah . ; and then you 're just sort you 've got like you know you 're sort of like ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_885	b	It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr029_978	ba	and then ts get gives out a a waveform , ; and I I want to manipulate the the waveform , then . ; I see . ; Oh , that 's neat .
Bed010_201	b	So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . ; OK . ; And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well . ; Right .
Bro005_1006	s	where to put the MLP basically . ; Um . ; And I guess , you know , the the the real open question , ; I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions ,
Bed015_1744	g	Yeah , but about linguistic hedges , ; I mean , those those tend to be , um , funky anyways ; because they blur ; So we don't have that in here either do we ?
Buw001_1070	s	Yeah . ; that that y that you can't certainly can't require it ; or people aren't gonna want to do this . ; But but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful .
Bed002_677	b	an and that 's that but that isn't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? ; is sort of ; s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_139	%--	It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . ; Um , ; so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , ; and then tried to
Bmr019_1149	b	Hmm ! ; and , uh ; So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify ; Yeah .
Btr001_1680	2	Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right . ; and ; Yeah , that 's right . ; And even bigger things .
Bmr003_482	%	It 's Corps - S ; CSAE . ; Corpus of Spoken American English . ; S
Bro027_1662	b	And and , just , like , it gave me the baseline performance of the Aurora , ; which is like zero improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_522	bk	for the person who missed " gobbledy - gook " what did they put ? ; It was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , ; cuz I have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . ; Oh .
Btr001_1723	%--	You know ? ; I don't ; c Yeah . It 's it 's good to ; If it sounds like a yawn .
Bro025_514	b	and it uh , it got worse . ; Um , ; but of course I didn't play with it . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr026_330	%--	Right . ; so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . ; Um And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . ; One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred
Bro027_889	bk	Why twenty - eight ? ; I don't know . ; Uh . ; Oh .
Bro027_241	s	But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; That 's sort of what we found .
Bed011_356	%--	Right . ; So ; uh w do we wanna get going beyond more , which is sort of the ; Well , OK , so let 's let 's take let 's I
Bro004_453	t3	Bigger is worse . ; So you have uh basically two uh parts . ; This is error rate , I think . ; Ratio .
Buw001_82	qw	Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; How 's that working ?
Bed008_934	b	Yeah . ; I mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro005_209	b	Yes . ; Th - Yes . ; Training of the net , ; yeah .
Bmr026_789	b	Mm - hmm . ; Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that . ; So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . ; Yeah .
Bro011_524	x	right , right . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases .
Bmr020_1614	s	they you know , they ; Yeah , I als I ; Ruff ruff ! ; Yeah I also thought of there there are really some channels where it is almost um , only bre breathing in it .
Bed016_1035	b	You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something . ; Yeah . ; But that 's not metaphorical . ; Hmm .
Bmr011_389	s	Mm - hmm . ; if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a ; Yeah . ; if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there .
Bed005_1074	s	Yeah . ; Good . ; So The idea is that , each of these EI is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? ; So , for example , suppose that the person I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark .
Bed009_521	b	OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine . ; hmm ; uh ; Yeah .
Bmr007_179	%--	and and you know , I mean , w we know that an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that that that 's that 's viewed as being a culturally - relative thing , ; I mean , that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying . ; Uh - huh . ; And
Bro016_981	aa	They both want their cut . ; Aren't you ? ; Hmm . ; Hmm . Yeah .
Bmr005_1375	s	Yep . I think that 's probably true . ; Really ? ; So it 's the amount of ; It 's it 's just getting it going .
Bed012_32	bk	Oh , I see ; y Why are you specifying it in XML ? ; Um . Just because it forces us to be specific about the values here ? ; OK .
Bed011_409	s	Well , I guess . ; I 'm not sure how long it 's actually going to take . ; The reading task is a lot shorter . ; That was cut by fifty percent .
Bmr001_56	s	Actually , i ; Then there 's ; I know , but yeah . ; It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out .
Bro026_597	s	S ; So I ; And it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? ; Uh , I I think they are still , uh , tuning something on that .
Bmr014_313	b	Uh , well i it 's uh ; He was in . ; I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts . ; Yeah .
Bro016_1015	aa	do you wanna say something about your stuff here ? ; Oh , ; um . ; Right .
Bro024_1950	t3	Just just take a minute . ; I can send ; yet . ; Would you pass those down ?
Bro005_1151	s	You were doing some something that was ; So maybe the analogy isn't quite right . ; You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . ; You had reverb for a single variable
Bns003_881	s	Yeah , ; so what I mean is at a certain degree , yeah , that has to be figured out . ; Yeah . ; There 's a connection point .
Bro024_716	s	So , ; m ; w ; But the but the , uh , forty - seven point nine percent which you have now , that 's already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal .
Bmr031_41	%--	So we 'll have a little more background noise ; and Uh . ; Or we can close the door and make Chuck knock when he comes . ; Well , I tend to
Bro017_155	s	Uh yeah , ; if of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done . ; Mm - hmm . ; But weights were also deter already decided uh half a year ago .
Btr002_2590	b	Yeah , i I it was maybe Tigerfish had done something ; Well done . ; like they had written out a phonetic laugh , ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns002_768	s	Mm - hmm . ; And eh , if you are transmitting at , let 's say , uh at one megabit per second , this means one microsecond per bit . ; OK ? ; So this only is taking eight milliseconds ,
Bro024_608	s	I meant in in the in the , uh , multi - language , uh , uh , Finnish and ; Uh ; This is next next page . ; That 's the next next spreadsheet , is
Bmr015_731	b	Yeah , that 's wh ; No . I I I I don't proth process the the fundamental . ; I I , ehm I calculate the the phase derivate using the FFT . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_489	s	You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere . ; If people are doing a wide range of things , ; doing location , ; uh , you know , doing a bunch of things ,
Bed010_354	b	That 's separable , ; yeah . ; I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag ; Yep .
Bro003_393	%	Um , and Uh , however , you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation . ; So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other , ; because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we we note it and say , " Look , we did do this " . ; Mmm ?
Bro014_164	b	Hmm . ; So after I did that , then what I wanted to do was try increasing the number of mixtures , ; just to see , um see how how that affects performance . ; Yeah .
Bro012_675	s	So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Dave , the other thing , actually , is is this business about this wave form .
Bmr016_845	bk	Oh OK . ; Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood . ; Oh I see . ; OK .
Btr001_424	b	Mm - hmm . ; Menton . ; Or in Quebec , ; That 's right .
Bed008_689	b	so it could be compatibility with his current state ; which would include his money and his time and and his energy ; Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . ; Right .
Bed008_941	b	yeah . ; Right . ; Because that 's what we , I mean that 's why this situation comes up . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1575	s	OK . ; And it 's also also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing is proposed to the ; Hmm ? ; So I I don't think it 'll be bad .
Bmr005_642	aa	I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . ; Yeah . ; Well , also Jane Jane was doing word level . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_244	s	Yes . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; So . ; I have a uh , um , question .
Bmr022_1355	b	can't check in to the archive . ; Mm - hmm . ; Whereas we could say " other people " , you know , " these people are allowed to actually submit changes " . ; Right .
Bed014_657	s	Or ; Anyway . ; So one could well imagine , ; but not yet .
Bro010_1287	bk	Oh , OK . ; Um . ; But w ; OK .
Bed008_910	t1	Yeah , but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough . ; Yeah , I mean , see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with " Go - there " is either gonna be true or false . ; Well , what ; Whoops .
Bmr007_437	aa	Yeah . ; Right ? ; In in the sense that i if you said if i i i ; Yeah , I I don't di I agree with that .
Bro003_1001	bk	that 's right . ; I mean , cuz , ; so , for instance , I think the major advantage of MSG ; Oh !
Btr001_186	s	I mean , ; um , ; I forget who it was that I was transcribing ; but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying , uh , at any given point in time
Bro012_1163	b	Uh , I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , um by looking at um , you know , uh I guess harmonics ; or looking across time ; Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though , ; Mmm .
Bmr005_198	ba	Uh - huh . ; Could be . ; Yeah . That would be tou ; Oh , that would be interesting .
Bmr022_1039	s	Some pass SSH tunneled CVS , ; Well , I I was ; and then give them access . ; I was reading through some of the CVS documentation
Bro019_483	s	And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now . ; And uh , ; Yeah , ; I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks .
Btr001_190	g	and I would I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going " Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! " ; like , not really understanding a ; Yeah . ; you know ?
Bmr011_636	s	I 'm not so much worried about disk space actually . ; I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , ; Just ; but the real issue is that , uh , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew .
Btr001_101	b	I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage ; and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed006_1098	aa	Yeah . ; um well I should have we should have added an ano an XML example , ; or some XML examples ; Yeah .
Bro013_17	s	So . ; The both the uh the SRI System and the oth ; Um . ; And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of uh training data or not ,
Btr002_318	b	" eh , that 'll be a problem " . ; then I would think that there should be a period there . ; Period . Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1363	s	So we need to have some mechanism for , um , handling changes in the future . ; I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it , ; which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts . ; u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting .
Bro021_151	s	I know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much , but sometimes , ; Mm - hmm . ; but but , um , ; just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough .
Bmr021_375	ba	Did you have to re - nice one of the processes to make sure that " shorten " ? ; No , no . Actually it was fast enough . ; This is very fast . This this really runs quickly . ; Wow .
Bmr029_379	s	Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone . ; In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's it 's not really true .
Bmr008_86	s	P prone . ; Yeah . ; Sitting . ; Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession .
Bro021_780	s	Well , um , the question is that ; Well . ; Remove some noise but not too much . ; And when we put the m m the , em , VAD , the result is better .
Bmr001_73	%--	OK , what do we do with the stuff on top ? ; Fill it out . ; But I ; Do we say it after we
Bmr019_864	b	Well , see , Adam would be ; Yeah , whatever you use . ; I mean , we convert it to this format that the , um , NIST scoring tool unders uh , CTM . Conversation Time - Marked file . ; Yeah .
Bed012_718	qy	And then , I sort of ; Oh , yeah , that sounds good , too . ; sort of bask in in your glory . ; But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans ,
Bro027_882	d	and you 're just feeding them like that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; There isn't any KLT or anything ?
Bmr008_93	%--	So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is . ; um I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be . ; Yeah . ; I think that
Bro022_458	s	But but , ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; no , it 's the electronics .
Bro024_181	s	and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance . ; Oh . ; You know , if you if if if there 's a lot of phones in one second maybe you 'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things , ; and and , uh , on the other hand if someone 's talking slowly maybe you 'd need more .
Bro027_1333	b	But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow . ; Mm - hmm . ; If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , uh , improving the the net . ; Yeah ,
Bed011_786	br	Mm - hmm . ; Actually , maybe uh F uh so , F ; Yeah , OK . ; Hmm ?
Bed006_1385	ba	But U s t So ; In principle . ; " Approach and then enter . " ; the I think the in some sense we we ex get the task done extremely well
Bed015_2128	s	Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . ; It 's just you need an ontology of the domain ; and you need the context dependent modules . ; And if this can be made to work at all , that 'd be kind of funky .
Bro013_282	s	Um . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to ; uh I mean it 's still read .
Bro027_775	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Probably half . ; Good !
Bed015_360	%--	but they does . ; Well , there 's an alternative to this ; At least in English . ; which is , um The question was did we want directed motion ,
Bro022_801	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . ; Right .
Bro012_406	%--	That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies . ; Mmm , yeah . ; Mmm , yeah . ; It 's
Bmr011_1387	s	Um , so it 's still worthwhile . ; it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording ; So ; so u I didn't have to do it each time .
Bro004_396	h	Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's ; um But we did ; Oh yeah ,
Bed014_1048	s	W why do you ? ; Yeah , exactly . ; And ; Sorry , two PM .
Bro021_210	g	So why does that m smooth things out ? ; at least ; I don't I don't understand that . ; Well , there 's less difference . Right ?
Bmr023_242	qy	Does it sound OK ? ; Yeah . ; So , um Yeah . We just used those . ; And do you splice them into the waveform ?
Btr002_3035	bk	Oh , I see . ; I see . ; Eh Um , so if they go " r e m m " , I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " . ; Oh .
Bmr021_679	ba	so the the things that Dave Gelbart ; Yeah , excellent . ; Cool . ; Excellent .
Bmr005_1411	s	or is that still a possibility ? ; Uh , they seem to have some problems with it . We can we can talk about that later . ; Um , but , again , Jerry is Jerry 's open ; So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting ,
Bns001_125	ft	Next maybe next meeting I will uh , do a small sketch about uh , my past work , and well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks , so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Thank you .
Bro012_312	s	The silence model expected duration was really different . ; And so in the case where um it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer . ; Yeah . ; So it was like it was a better match .
Bmr028_340	bk	Uh , cuz July The the meeting is July sixteenth through eighteenth . ; And , uh , my talk 's the first day . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr003_2243	ba	But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . ; Got the fifth ? ; You g ; Oh , how great .
Bro027_1625	s	Mm - hmm . ; So ; The ; I 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the p clean up
Bmr029_859	h	And he said there were a few in the Macrophone set like that . ; So , do we need to wait to find out who he 's gonna throw out , ; so that we create a new set of short models that don't include those speakers ? ; Uh
Bns003_353	b	I don't know . ; I will take a look and I will tell you something . ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1135	qrr	Does the smoothing in the time domain help ; Um ; Well , do you get this musical noise stuff with Wiener filtering ; or is that only with , uh , spectral subtraction ?
Bro018_163	b	Mm - hmm . ; And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful ; and figure out what they can what they most need from things , and I mean that 's what they 're good at . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2283	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; When when did people laugh ? ; That 's great .
Bed005_336	s	Yep . ; So ; That 'd be great . ; It would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run .
Bmr016_460	s	A round . ; or ; Row , row , row your boat . ; Round .
Bed006_476	s	So I take it that was similar to the what what we did for the parsing ? ; Yeah . ; I I it even though the generator is a little bit more complex ; and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words ,
Bdb001_657	%	See , cuz it 's ; Can you can you say that this is part of this , ; Hhh . ; it 's
Bmr016_2123	s	Those are two different words . ; They 're spelled the same way , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And they 're still gonna be transcribed as READ .
Bmr022_1416	s	Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro projects face this same problem . ; Right . ; You know , p anybody can check out the code , ; but not everybody can check it in .
Btr002_360	b	Right . ; but they 're pretty rare ; those things , the f ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_680	%--	So , uh , it 's something a little bit , uh , strange ; but it is this this is the w ; What ? ; They are not
Bmr021_353	b	Then I just move the new wavefile to the , you know , to the old wavefile , ; Right . ; and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1000	s	Well , I think ; What what is what is what is this web page from ? ; Well , I apparently , ; you know , I roam around on on topics like this
Bmr013_177	aa	But that I mean it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , I mean , every everything is good . ; Yeah . ; It 's the beginning of time in speech recognition . ; Yes , exactly .
Bro021_299	b	Yeah . ; Which is not really noise , actually . ; It 's just adding a constant to each of the mel , uh , energy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_546	%--	copy it somewhere else . ; This was user something ; or ; Well this was
Bmr020_898	ba	Ah ! ; Clever . ; Yes . ; Clever .
Bmr009_431	s	Mm - hmm . ; And ; But I guess I was just saying that that right now uh from the means that you gave , I don't have any sense of whether even , you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct ; and I would imagine there should be some you know , there should be The distributions should be somewhat separated .
Bro027_63	qw	but . ; and hundred and hundred hundred and maybe it 's like fi hundred hertz . ; But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ? ; What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ?
Bmr003_498	s	Great . ; unless of course they have funding issues ; Great . ; and then then it ma they may not do phase two
Bmr013_105	aa	So , that ; Per digit . ; Per digit . ; You 're right .
Bmr005_703	aa	Uh , speed up your your your marking ? ; nnn , I don't understand very . ; It took you a long time to mark twelve minutes . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_762	b	And you can do some , uh , you know , first - order thing about it , ; which is to have people move it , uh , uh , a away from being just directly in front of the middle ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bro024_194	aa	But what do you What about if I w I fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ? ; Yeah , but then you 'll have the degradation of of , uh , whatever you do uh , added onto that . ; But maybe . ; Yeah ,
Bmr003_675	s	yeah . ; So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ? ; Or is that really just a guess ? ; Actually that 's the the one people usually use , ten X .
Bmr026_804	s	Uh w what do you mean ? ; More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? ; No , uh front - end features . ; You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra .
Bro018_328	%--	Mm - hmm . ; to look at the code ; and something like that ; to know exactly what they are doing
Buw001_1764	b	W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work ; Well ; uh , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_145	aa	Hmm . ; And , um , y you also did some something in addition ; which was , um , for those in which there was , uh , quiet speakers in the mix . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_203	s	you know I was saying " Professor " . ; I mean a Visiting S Researcher or whatever . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , when I said " Professor " , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more " PHD but not Post - doc " .
Bro019_1104	b	not that I know of . ; Yeah , ; cuz everybody 's scared . ; Yeah .
Bed002_447	s	That 's not getting at the scientific problem , ; and it 's ; Mm - hmm . ; In general you 're you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that .
Btr002_1878	s	This sound must be this ! " ; y I had one like that where they were describing the different f qualities of " uh - huh " and " uh " and " uah " ; and like what " EH " is versus " UH " versus " AH " . ; u u I had yeah , I had one like that too .
Bro026_663	s	Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold , ; and they shouldn't even care about what the score is . ; Yeah . ; But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with .
Bmr016_765	aa	OK . ; Not names , ; but I Ds . ; Yep .
Bmr027_1075	aa	Sorry , what ? ; Discourse markers ? ; Discourse markers . ; Sure . Sure , sure , sure .
Bmr024_349	%--	uh , would we would we do better ? ; So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or false starts , it 's it 's much less c it 's much less common than one percent ? ; But that 's pretty uncommon . ; Um , if we could really get one percent on
Buw001_904	%--	So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? ; Yeah . ; So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , ; um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna
Bed016_847	s	Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . ; Yeah . ; And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics , ; OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week .
Bmr007_411	s	And and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't . ; Right . ; We 're looking at it here . ; So that 's why it 's coming to us as new
Bro028_769	%	Or or if it 's ? ; Yeah , th I have I I I don't have it up here ; but I have a the whole system description , that describes exactly what their system is ; OK .
Bro012_1029	%--	That that seems like one prominent thing . ; And then uh weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something ? ; That was ; Was it
Bed002_111	s	Right . ; OK . ; but we find that ; We want the meeting to be as natural as possible .
Bmr030_11	s	which was originally pretty big , but it 's divided among many sites , ; and they , like , cut the budget by a th by two thirds . ; So they they approved it for all the sites , ; but only gave us like sixty - two percent of the money .
Bmr029_102	s	I recently retrained , um , for another reason , on the full training set . ; And that took only I think it took only two days . ; Yeah . ; So , it 's actually conceivable to do use the full training set .
Bro004_1089	s	what ; is what is the difference between ASP and uh baseline over ? ; Yeah , I don't know . ; ASP .
Bed003_78	s	Wait , what do you want me to do ? ; Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear ? ; No , It 's OK . ; It 's It 'll work .
Btr002_3185	bk	th that that that stays . ; Mmm ; Right . Oh , OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1468	g	Mm - hmm . ; and we 'll get two different corpora . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bed009_385	s	uh , No , ; it 's it 's also a quantrant uh uh ; i Is it ; So there 's ac so there th the word " action " , OK , is is what 's ambiguous here .
Btr002_2537	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if it 's meant as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it , with the HMPH thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1321	%	Yeah . ; their academic . ; And they 're they 've been quite responsive . ; eh
Bro003_2025	bk	And because they had done some cheating experiments ; This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus . ; So , this was Larry Saul who did this did this . ; Oh , OK .
Bro027_2061	%--	Yeah , ; um ; so the evaluation should be on a week before ; or
Bmr011_1764	s	But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , ; so you get some speech and then a " mm - hmm " , and some more speech , ; so that whole thing is one chunk . ; And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it ,
Bmr025_238	s	But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . ; Yeah , right . ; If he has then you learn , ; if he hasn't then he 'll do it .
Bro018_59	ar	R correlations . ; No , ; Oh . ; R c No .
Bmr010_699	s	Yeah . ; It 's interesting , ; uh , ; I talked to some IBM guys , uh , last January , I think , I was there .
Bmr031_148	ba	Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ? ; So Roughly . Almost . ; Not quite . ; Wow ! That 's getting pretty good .
Buw001_1459	%--	They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries . ; OK . ; Yeah , that 's like ; n
Bsr001_284	b	Mmm . ; That seems to work OK too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_474	bk	They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle . ; Exactly . ; This is limiting the choices , but yeah . ; Right .
Bed017_477	s	It 's like , um , you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; um , s how to interpret . ; In in this case , infer in in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask .
Bmr002_518	qh	And so that 's just whatever it is . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's how we 'll do it . ; See what I mean ?
Bns001_1024	s	of the contents , in principle . ; But , I don't see that uh ; It 's too late , I believe . ; If WAP was available in the beginning of GSM , then I think it was there would be a good chance that it is well - deployed .
Bed009_448	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; whereas in the a um tourist domain it might be an entire route . ; Indeed .
Bed005_1385	s	Yeah , it 's ; Right , we can just assume ; and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type . ; So we build a little data structure
Bed005_1355	s	Yeah , but the ontology is really not a SmartKom thing , ; in in and of itself . ; That 's more something that I kicked loose in in EML . ; So it 's a completely EML thing .
Bed014_400	2	Uh , just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at . ; We 've talked about it , but only the innermost inner group currently , uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; Knows .
Bro004_213	s	OK , fine . ; Let 's let 's use the conventional meaning of baseline . ; Hmm . ; I I By baseline here I meant uh using the task specific data .
Bmr019_467	s	It 's tha that that we were saying , you know , well is how much worse is far than near , you know . ; Oh , th OK . ; And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at , ; That factor of two .
Bns003_790	bk	But I think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings . ; So ; how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and ; Yeah .
Bro013_643	%	So you oughta be able to pick out voiced segments . ; At least it should be another another cue . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . Anyway .
Bro003_1238	no	And I think there there there 's I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now . ; Is it faster to do it on the SPERT , ; or ? ; Uh , don't know .
Bro024_1292	b	And we were looking at the " Music " utterances ; and in this case the noise is more about two thousand hertz . ; Well , the music energy 's very low apparently . ; Yeah .
Bed009_888	s	So it 's ; Yeah th the information is available . ; OK . ; I see .
Btr001_752	%--	Yeah . ; l you know , like ; With fricatives a lot . ; Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh
Bro003_1635	s	Yeah , OK . ; There 's there 's a lot more space there , ; and it 'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things . ; So , anything that that you don't need backed up , we can put on this new disk .
Bed008_209	s	one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . ; I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . ; Well ; Oh just uh accidentally erased this ,
Bro018_637	h	S do you get some kind of number between zero and one at the output ? ; Actually you don't get a you don't get a nice number between zero and one . ; You get you get either a zero or a one . ; Um , uh
Bro007_312	s	Uh it 's o it 's OGI two , ; The bottom one there ? ; it 's so the th it 's the features from the first line ; It 's in fact OGI two .
Bro021_1193	s	uh , we can write that the estimation of the clean speech is equal at an expected value of the clean speech conditional to , uh , the noise signal the probability f of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is the methods that say that we 're going obtain this .
Bmr012_875	b	Mmm . ; One one question which is I I had the impression from this from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_558	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times . ; So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session .
Bsr001_1479	qy	Three peop total ? ; We 're gonna start with just three people , ; yeah . ; Is that the channel limitation cutting in ?
Bro024_50	s	ap ap apart from that , I guess the the main thing I have t ta I have to talk is , um , where I 'm planning to go over the next week . ; Um . ; So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system . ; And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean ,
Bro018_276	bk	Given this this uh regular old net that 's just for choosing for other purposes , uh add up the probabilities of the different subclasses and see see how well you do . ; Uh and that you know anything that you do over here should be at least as good as that . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro027_1336	%--	Yeah , ; mm - hmm . ; Um . ; So what 's the overall effe
Bns002_878	b	others that are a little bit far away ; and finally , these neighbors that are in the in the frontier of your of your coverage area . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bed014_774	s	Oh , right . ; So . ; Um . ; Yeah . So I think in fact , That 's the other thing .
Bmr015_619	b	Yeah . ; And for purposes of of , uh , things like ; well , so things like training the speech - nonspeech segmentation thing . ; Yeah .
Bed013_145	b	Unless it was in a situation . ; We 'd have to set up a situation where , it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there . ; Yeah ! ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1746	co	Well , u Not sure . ; I mean , ; Hmm . ; let 's put it this way .
Bmr016_603	%--	OK . ; um ; but as we I mean I wanted to here more about the transcription . ; If we can get the channel asynchronous or the
Bns003_424	bk	But ; b ; But that could still be applicable if you put it under the ICSI site if you take the responsibility for that . ; Yes ,
Bed006_560	ba	Mm - hmm . ; and ; you can speak into it and ask for TV and movie information ; Toll .
Bmr003_1660	s	it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these automatic speaker detection turn placing things . ; Because suddenly ; I mean , I don't know , ; actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels .
Bed002_294	ba	No , that one 's already on , I thought he said . ; I I think ; It 's on ? ; OK , good .
Bmr009_168	b	uh separated . ; This is the the first derivate of log of frame energy uh without any kind of normalization . ; What ; Yeah .
Bed003_885	s	right ? ; What I was thinking was if you had a like ; Oh it 's it affects th The " doing business " is certainly not . ; You could affect Theoretically you could affect " doing business " with " has door " .
Bmr012_995	s	if it was possible cuz it is i ; you know already we have a a a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked ; Right . ; and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store ,
Bed006_50	ft	u That 's pretty good , I think . ; I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Thanks .
Bro027_1042	s	which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . ; And so , ; uh , ; they felt they wanted to set a limit .
Bro011_343	%--	do you ha still have that ? ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . ; There 's those that
Bmr011_1621	%--	Yeah . ; So , uh , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? ; I mean , film - making or something like that . ; Exactly , that 's what I was
Bmr026_858	d	But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there ; So . ; because we 're doing ; Oh yeah
Bmr026_1161	%--	Uh , how much training data ? ; Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . ; And how How many hours is that ? ; That 's why I was
Bmr006_1246	b	But th I don't think that matters , though . ; But ; That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , " Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? " ; Right .
Buw001_1120	s	We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? ; Are are we gonna try and o ; Yeah . ; And so that was one suggestion .
Bro021_796	b	or ? ; Uh , I do the experiment using only the f onl eh , to use on only one fair estimation of the noise . ; Or i ? ; Yeah .
Bro004_1323	s	No . ; No ? ; Oh , that 's good . ; It just died .
Bmr003_1359	ba	It 's also All the source is available . ; So . ; Right . ; Great .
Bed015_1563	%--	So I thought of having like for each referent , having the list of of the things t with which it is identified . ; You know , which which , uh you know , you you you ; You could do that . ; for instance , um
Bed015_860	%--	y Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; But figure out how the
Bmr019_1530	s	Yeah . ; Um , let 's see . ; I think the only thing we had left was unless somebody else ; Well , there 's a couple things .
Bed003_100	%--	Nice coinage . ; Thank you . ; uh , of a of a building . ; Whether the
Bns003_1009	s	Sven Buchholz . ; He was here . ; I invited him and discussed with him his potential work , I @ @ . ; quite sure
Bmr027_961	s	Well , that 's on my list . ; Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process . ; I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . ; There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that it 's just that aren't in there .
Bro017_1147	aa	They have smaller means , also . ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; Exactly .
Bro027_1345	s	so I wonder what the net effect is . ; I d I I think it 's it was one or two percent . ; That 's not that bad , ; but it was l like two percent relative worse on SpeechDat - Car .
Bro028_614	ar	Hmm . ; Did they say anything on the conference call about , um , how the Wall Street Journal part of the test was going to be run ? ; Because I I thought I remembered hearing that some sites were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff at their place , ; No .
Bmr026_221	s	Mmm . ; and you can't you can't access that ; so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack ; and then install the Transcriber thing
Bro027_1429	s	Uh - huh . ; Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better . ; The a the argument i is kind of i in ; and it 's not like we really know ,
Bmr016_290	s	And they 're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth , ; OK , fine . ; so it 's it 's it 's really pretty different . ; But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework ,
Bmr022_1125	b	I mean , I 'm not too worried , ; because the group 's pretty small . ; But ; Yeah .
Bro003_740	s	Oh . ; Um , in his previous Aurora experiments . ; And with the net it 's it 's wonderful . ; Without the net it 's just baseline .
Bro003_1405	no	Mm - hmm . ; And , ; Hmm . ; I don't know what .
Bro026_487	b	But I don't think the storage is so big for that . ; Right . ; I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net . ; Yeah .
Bro025_86	s	Uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much . ; Um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering . ; Hmm . ; Uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different .
Btr002_3201	b	m and that would be an " er " . ; Oh , I don't get that one . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1431	bk	but not for the other system ; because I didn't test it yet this system , including with spectral subtraction on the TI - digits data . ; I just tested it on SpeechDat - Car . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1277	%	So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data . ; But unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it . ; OK ? ; OK , then
Bmr012_92	%	OK . ; OK , ; so we are recording . ; Ah .
Bed011_755	%--	Wow ; It seems like this would be really hard to guess . ; I mean , on the part of the system . ; It seems like it
Bed009_770	%--	And they are not fast enough . ; Mm - hmm . ; And they also have to be very robust . cuz of um speech recognition errors ; and
Bro008_514	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr001_1578	b	That 's true . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bed015_601	bd	Yeah . ; But but bottom line , I agree with you , ; Yeah . ; That 's all .
Bmr018_1584	%--	Oh they didn't ? ; They just switched position . ; Well ; well that 's getting cl
Bmr003_2077	s	And so the the two head set jacks would be in the front ; and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live . ; The the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels . ; And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this .
Bmr014_999	s	Giving it to them . ; right ? ; OK . ; It just means they have the right to have it .
Bro027_1830	b	right ? ; Am I missing something here ? ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_604	%--	send it to everybody saying " this is what they have , ; this is what we think we should add " , ; OK ? ; and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying " Hmm , well "
Bmr026_1251	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Btr001_542	b	And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks , ; Hmm . ; which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2138	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using . ; that 's right .
Bed005_1363	s	OK . ; It 's a political problem . ; We won't worry about it . ; No , but th the r eh I th I still think that there is enough information in there .
Bro022_672	s	Yes . ; OK , ; good . ; So they are helping .
Bed015_1838	%--	Yeah . ; So we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain ; and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , ; assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d
Bed013_254	s	Ooo , it 's just big . ; But I mean , this 'll get us a bit closer at least , right ? ; I mean . ; If it takes us a second to do , for each one , and let 's say it 's twenty billion , then that 's twenty billion seconds ,
Btr002_2903	b	Kind of makes sense ; because if you 're if you wanna speak next , it 's almost like you got y you gotta get your foot in the door . ; You gotta be the one who you know , make sure people recognize that you 're the one who 's gonna speak next . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_577	d	So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking ; OK . ; Really ? ; So you could actually produce like code
Bmr014_1022	g	I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented , ; Oh yeah yeah ; oh I know . ; right ?
Bmr001_864	co	OK . ; How many more you got ? ; Oh I on I did ten but I can I have a script to generate them automatically . ; Well , let 's do some more while we got them here .
Bmr010_1551	qw	Using the the Gaussian . ; You mean Javier 's ? ; Yeah . ; What do you mean ?
Btr002_1230	s	Oh . ; And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected . ; Mm - hmm . ; Same with " six " .
Bro010_842	s	Right . ; which you train by gradient descent . ; Yeah , ; so he uses , um , an EM algorithm to to um train up these um parameters for the logistic regression .
Bmr021_717	%--	And uh I first trained up two systems , ; because it 's gender - dep you know , the SRI system is gender - dependent ; so to be comparable , I trained uh um on a sh on a so - called short training set ; um a male system and a female system ,
Buw001_2043	%--	So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . ; But but these other factors are fine . ; I just wanted to raise the issue . ; Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , uh , unintrusive as possi
Bed016_277	s	This was an actual , um , subject ? ; Ah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sounds like Fey .
Bro003_1081	s	But , yeah , ; I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out , ; um ; It 's not really two to the seventh .
Bed011_987	b	Once we have the full ontology API , what can we expect to get from the ontology ? ; And hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the ; Mm - hmm . ; mm - hmm .
Bmr007_766	t3	f But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that . ; Andreas was wearing that same old sweater again . ; Right ? ; You 'd want a video for that , I think .
Bed014_1177	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm mm - hmm . ; I just sort of said " alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , uh , major verb co uh , constructions out of the way first . " And I have not gotten them out of the way yet . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1831	s	I think it 's it 's converging . ; It 's as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do ; which is the mental the whole s mental space thing . ; And then there 's some other minor things .
Bro003_216	s	They are downsampled to eight kilohertz ; but but they are not uh with telephone bandwidth . ; Yeah . ; That 's really funny
Bed015_1323	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So . But that that that 's sort of OK .
Bro010_923	s	Mm - hmm . ; and we say , " OK , we train every " ; What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is ; or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units .
Bed013_906	s	Is that supposed to be the international sign for interface ? ; I think so , yeah . ; Mmm . OK . ; I 'd I 'd never seen it before either .
Bed009_1091	s	Mm - hmm . ; So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w ; if it works right , ; OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place
Bmr008_263	s	I don't care . ; Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ? ; Yeah . ; Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like Post - Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or whatever .
Bmr023_249	ba	Mm - hmm . ; He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps . ; It will be funny ; It sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . Really .
Bsr001_776	b	I was gonna say that , um , you know , in terms ; So , Adam has a you know , a particular agenda , ; um , but obviously there are lots of other things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1711	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_425	ba	and " oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you " , ; If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it . ; you know . ; Oh , excellent .
Bmr011_837	s	Oh . Oh . ; I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . ; And so it 's very , very similar . ; And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types .
Bed017_285	bk	uh , structural uncertainty . ; It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM ; is that classes and relations , ; OK .
Bro023_795	s	So ; Tried this stuff on the mel as well ; mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things . ; But it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result .
Bns003_528	aa	Yeah ? ; Everybody agree ? ; Um , I don't know . ; OK .
Bmr013_671	%	OK . ; and I just don't have machine time there . ; But , once that 's moved over , uh , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , um , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . um , on the word strings . ; Oh , shoot !
Bed010_142	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So uh we are committed for our funding . ; Right .
Bed003_971	ar	It does learning , ; it has ; Mm - hmm . ; No it doesn't , actually .
Btr002_1273	s	and then you would listen to it , ; and everyth the j ; there were two parts to the task , ; one of them was to see if that 's what they actually said ,
Bed009_37	s	this is Ami , who ; And this is Tilman and Ralf . ; Hi . ; Uh - huh . Nice to meet you .
Bsr001_655	aa	This is this is ; That that was daring . ; The PDA one is very , very ambitious . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_501	no	in fact , we could you know we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that . ; Yeah , we were talking about that . ; Yeah . ; I 'm not sure if anyone 's still using it .
Bmr013_712	s	And then , ; should provide this . ; If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , ; but , in in the first minute , uh , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good .
Btr002_596	s	It that 's not the case ? ; Answer ? ; That they don't ; That they that they don't .
Bmr006_313	s	Uh , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? ; I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , ; that 's why we did it . ; But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone .
Bmr027_606	s	Yeah . ; So it 's unusual that that they , uh ; So my original impression was that that was sufficient , ; that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden .
Bmr016_1507	s	Just I wanted to say I w think it would be fun to make a montage of it ; because there 's a " Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . "
Bmr016_875	bk	Yeah , I guess ; Right . ; the ones that you write out . ; OK .
Bmr011_1322	b	Yeah . ; and try to convince people " . ; So I 'm gonna try . Go to their meeting tomorrow ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_18	b	We just sorta go around and people say what 's going on , what 's the latest uh ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr005_502	ba	Right . ; The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea .
Bro003_324	qw	Hmm . ; Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call , ; and you know , I mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh , ; uh how do you know what language it is ?
Bed015_729	b	Mm - hmm . ; or that there are things like , you know , ; I think Keith was telling me , things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused focused element , ; Mmm .
Bmr024_862	b	My understanding is , the issue isn't really the file server . ; Yeah . ; We could always put more disks on . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_825	s	OK . ; And then I median - filtered that using , um a fairly long filter length . ; Uh well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers . ; Um and that 's to average out you know , pitch , you know , the pitch contours , and things like that .
Bmr012_922	b	That isn't music . ; that isn't music and isn't telephone , ; And I guess if you 're comparing like uh if you wanna run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that ; yeah .
Bed009_1079	%	Nancy is going to ; Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep , yep .
Btr002_603	s	Oh . ; Good . ; That , uh , I mean , you know , one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have , ; but we 've got good microphones
Bmr016_1474	s	yeah . ; No , only if you don't have lax vowels , I guess . ; Right . ; So it 's like Japanese and Spanish
Bro024_1581	bk	It 's overall . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1130	s	And eh , finally , the other the other thing , which is also under research or under study is , uh to have some kind of a power - aware routing . ; There are some proposals , too . ; So that way you could ; routing function could be connected with uh global or local power consumption .
Bmr011_622	s	So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , ; uh , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , ; who 's interested , ; and even if ICSI it itself isn't .
Bmr019_169	s	And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances , ; and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent . ; So , it 's , um that 's the number there . ; Point six , I believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .
Bro005_898	aa	Results are only coming for for this net . ; Mmm . ; OK , yeah , just don't just need more more results there with that @ @ . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1290	s	Right . ; which might be equal , or whatever it is . ; Yeah . ; So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology .
Bmr015_804	bd	But , uh but I but but I don't know that you need to ; Open wide ! ; but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it . ; I mean that 'd that 'd be nice
Bmr025_551	bk	OK I 'll do that " . ; So . ; And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under " participants " they were filled in under " description " . ; Ah , OK .
Bed017_157	%--	And so I ended up making several classes ; Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , ; and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . ; And so some of these classes are
Bro028_226	s	Uh , we have some ideas about that . ; It would probably implies working a little bit on features that are more suited to a voice activity detection . ; Mm - hmm . ; Working on the second stream .
Bro011_734	bk	and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . ; Octave is the um UNIX clone of of Matlab which you can batch . ; Octave . ; Ah !
Bmr007_1022	s	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And then he had some sort of reasonable way of doing that ,
Bmr023_1147	s	come to think of it , ; because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . ; So , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . ; So in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .
Bro012_1314	s	I see , yeah . Mm - hmm . ; if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors ; Mm - hmm . ; and roughly independent errors ,
Bro027_276	s	Oh , OK . ; F Yeah , OK . ; So . ; Um , but , the software seemed to compile fine and everything ,
Btr001_2401	%--	Uh . ; like ; which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker , ; That 's
Bmr010_981	s	That 's a good idea . ; and they think of different ; and um , ; I trained them to , uh , f on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed .
Bmr012_1284	bk	Give us a status . ; Yeah . ; Oh good . ; OK .
Bro021_767	s	I think I ask you that every single meeting , ; don't I ? ; What ? ; I ask you that question every meeting .
Bro011_703	ba	yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Cool .
Bmr030_405	ba	We might wanna revisit hiring our own external transcription company . ; Because I think that would be cheaper than having our people do it , ; but do it with the same process with these beep files . ; Hmm , that 's an interesting idea .
Bed005_262	%--	OK . ; And that 's that 's the next step , ; but we 'll get to that in a second . ; p
Bsr001_915	b	his algorithm . ; Yeah , ; I mean Broadcast News is for this third - party listener , ; Hmm ?
Bed014_842	s	That metaphor is not going anywhere , you know . ; So ; Yeah . ; Ri - No . Absolutely .
Bdb001_59	aa	You mean , this ; I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board . ; OK , ; yeah .
Btr002_1657	b	Yeah . ; I ; I love those . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1496	%--	Right . ; But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the take the pitch from the real data , feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data . ; Yeah . ; so I
Bmr008_157	%--	I g ; I ; DTD ? ; uh , the data , so that ,
Bed008_1525	bk	Fey , you mean . ; OK . ; OK . ; O OK .
Bed015_1839	%--	So we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain ; and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , ; assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d ; you know , there 's all sorts of God knows , irony , and stuff like
Bro024_1209	aa	So the v ; The VAD ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_954	s	Use this analysis bandwidth or something . ; But I I I don't know , ; it 's actually been awhile since I 've looked at it . ; Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the RASTA libs and thing like that .
Bro027_819	bk	Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay , ; no . ; Maybe it 's better to wait ; OK .
Bmr020_1839	s	or should we start after the that part of the meeting is over ; Which part ? ; in what we send . ; So , the part where they 're using sounds from their from their laptops .
Bro021_122	b	No . ; u Maybe it 's this this idea of having different on - line normalization , um , tunings for the different MFCC 's . ; For each , uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_2201	aa	Should we do the one PM time ; for Thursday since we were on that before ; or ? ; Sure .
Bmr014_647	%--	Were were you basically done with ; the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing . ; Right . ; So the The idea is that we need to have
Bmr019_1892	s	Take take several . ; looking at chocolates , deciding ; Mmm . ; you know , it 's another style .
Btr001_782	bk	Or " sss " . ; Or ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Bro018_316	qw	And one of the arguments for making it later is let 's make sure that whatever techniques that we 're using work for something more than than connected digits . ; Hmm . ; So . ; When are they planning When would they do that ?
Bmr021_674	s	And this is not just the Transcriber , ; this is the Channeltrans , ; right ? ; Yeah , it 's the Channeltrans ,
Bmr023_577	h	That 's ; How about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? ; Oh , my God . ; Uh .
Bmr022_1373	s	but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you , ; Right . ; even if they were listening to it . ; So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong ,
Bed013_904	aa	and he whether he 's in a wheelchair or not , ; OK . ; Is that supposed to be the international sign for interface ? ; I think so , yeah .
Bro023_433	s	Yep , ; it 's three point four , ; uh , eight point , uh , seven , ; and , uh , thirteen point seven .
Bed005_1476	s	That was wi that was my note . ; The little note I sent said that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It said , " Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . "
Bed004_853	aa	Right . ; Parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . ; Because the mean the semantics are very complex in that . ; Right .
Bmr016_1040	b	Yeah . ; It was also true of the digits task which was X Waves . ; Because because i we used X Waves to do the digits . ; Yeah .
Bed009_875	b	So in in in German you 've got uh most of this done with ; Mm - hmm . Also it 's uh it 's um Yes , uh the um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr019_1128	s	you know " Burst " also ? ; It 's gonna ; Well , that 's what we were calling spurt , ; Burst .
Bro019_1635	%--	I see . ; That 's sort of the point . ; But Yeah . ; i Ordinarily , in a formant synthesizer , the bandwidths as well as the ban uh , formant centers are
Bro018_211	s	O ; Is that maybe that 's accuracy ? ; Percent . ; The accuracy .
Bmr006_1732	s	And then , Jose responds . ; Yeah . ; And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . ; But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " .
Bro028_561	aa	sixty - thousand ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_1482	b	Yeah . ; I haven't really had time to do that . ; Yeah . Actually , I wanted to talk with you about that ; Yeah .
Bmr011_535	bk	I see . ; Fine . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro013_588	qw	Yeah , there is th this fact actually . ; If you look at this um spectrum , ; Yeah . ; What 's this again ?
Bed015_765	s	Mm - hmm . ; so we need to have a notation for that ; which , um , ; I think that 's still in progress .
Bro018_672	s	but I think that uh this was a couple years ago , ; Hmm . ; I remember them doing it at some meeting , ; and and um I don't think people were very critical because it was interesting just to to try this
Bmr021_889	s	Um , the other thing is I 'm training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models ; Right . ; and then we can ; And I actually want to do the system combination um with our eval system um , on some subset of the data at least ,
Bmr026_861	b	Oh yeah ; w ; You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_631	b	So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on . ; Um . ; Just sort of t to make sure that we can do that ; Yeah .
Bro015_195	%--	Um . ; I don't know ; but it 's the company who prepared the Italian database , ; so it was
Bro003_1492	s	Mm - hmm . ; but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines . ; And we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster . ; So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another .
Bro017_97	s	Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; And uh we will run again ; still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms ,
Bed013_1013	s	but the smarter way is to go via the ontology ; and dynamically , then look up u stuff . ; OK . But you 're still doing look up so that when the person So the point is that when the person says , " where is it ? " then you sort of say , let 's go back and look at other things and then decide , ; rather than the other possibility which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things
Btr002_2081	b	Yeah ! Yeah . ; Mmm . ; It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1486	%--	I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself . ; What ? ; Why ? ; I just
Bmr020_96	%--	Well yeah , you sent it in late . ; Yeah , I guess you first you have to do the first one , ; Yeah . ; and then
Bro004_158	s	Uh , yeah . ; So um for uh TI - digits for ins ; example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent , ; uh . The error rate increase u of of of ten percent , relative .
Bmr014_1015	%	I could ; Yeah , but you 're wired ; aren't you ? ; Yeah .
Bed015_1389	s	Mm - hmm . ; is that where you would sa ; I mean , that 's ; OK , that 's where the information structure is
Bmr008_925	bk	N Right . Yeah . ; Well , y you didn't really talk about the non - English speaker categories . ; So . ; Right .
Bed008_1055	%--	because I want to do a little bit of organization . ; Before we get more into details . ; The organization is going to be that uh ; the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh
Bmr019_622	no	Right . ; Right . ; OK . ; And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back
Btr002_1244	s	Well , it w it would it had the benefit of it ; So , this this was to handle the digits , uh , only , ; OK . ; which is what you figure .
Bmr011_1717	2	Dan , ; yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah , and Dave uh Gel - Gelbart again ,
Bmr011_729	b	Thank you . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_548	aa	so . ; If you used a line out , too , you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something . It 'll beep onto onto the tape too . ; Maybe . ; That 's true .
Bmr015_52	b	So , does anyone have any a agenda items other than me ? ; I actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits . ; Uh , right , so so I I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bmr005_590	b	Now um did you make any use of that ? ; See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_954	s	And then , um , we , uh I sent him a pointer to three more . ; And so he 's off and working on those . ; Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct ; and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .
Bro013_115	s	But what would be interesting to see also is what what ; perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um recording conditions . ; I don't know . ; Because it 's probably not a problem of noise , because our features are supposed to be robust to noise .
Bed002_1056	s	And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on . ; An - Nuh . ; But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete . ; OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be ,
Bro022_1181	s	Um . ; Pratibha . ; Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain ; and so the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the level of the speech signal .
Bro004_1038	s	and maybe sometimes you don't run the other , ; maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . ; Mm - hmm . ; So um Their uh the results look pretty good .
Bmr006_651	bk	Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? ; We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . ; That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . ; OK .
Bed011_1065	b	And that 's gonna be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or or or something like that . ; Yeah . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_733	s	Mm - hmm . ; and then I 'll either create a sub - directory for , like if it 's Meeting Recorder project , or Hub - five or whatever . ; So we c ; I just have to create those sub - directories ,
Btr002_2034	bk	or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . ; Right . ; Oh , god ! ; There 'll be lots of breathing . Yeah .
Bmr020_1001	t3	No , no ! ; I don ; actually I I ; Let me make a note on yours .
Bro023_1009	s	what happen actually is that during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero ; but it varies a lot . ; Mmm , ; and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero .
Bed003_906	ba	I mean , I have before ; OK . ; Whew ! ; Well that 's fine ,
Bdb001_845	s	Mm - hmm . ; My opinion on that is for the s sort of stuff that we 're doing , I suspect it 's overkill to do a full relational database , that , um , just a flat file and , uh , search tools I bet will be enough . ; But ; But that 's the advantage of ATLAS , is that if we actually take decide to go that route completely and we program to their API , then if we wanted to add a database later it would be pretty easy .
Bmr025_956	%--	as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . ; The point is that we haven't used it at all ; and are we going to ? ; So we have no
Bro027_1814	b	for the ; I wonder if you could do this . ; But if you look at the , um , highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at , you know , the distribution versus the the other ones , do you do you see more peaks or something ? ; Yeah .
Bns003_89	%--	and I will definitely set up the next one . ; So Wilbert will set up the second computer . ; Yeah , ; though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a
Bmr018_748	s	And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to ; so so there are some things available , ; and I don't know too much about this area ; where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them ,
Bmr008_84	b	Can you just write something like " position " ? ; and people can fill in their own you know , " Post - doc " or " visitor " or whatever . ; P prone . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1101	ba	Very annoying . ; Yeah . ; There you go . ; Oh , much better .
Bmr028_1524	b	So the effect the immediate effect is gonna be to increase your error rate . ; Interesting . ; And so it was we had a couple papers like " Towards increasing the error rate in speech " and and so on . ; Hmm .
Bmr011_329	ba	But ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Wonderful .
Bmr007_1211	s	I like that idea . ; And I use it 's it 's , uh it 's an A below middle C beep , ; I think the beep is a really good idea . ; It 's very clear .
Bmr031_854	s	And , um So , ; Oh . ; the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed ; we 've got twenty - six hours that are finished being transcribed .
Bro010_953	s	Forced alignment on the sub - band labels ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You 've done that .
Bro026_196	s	This is an option that then you can ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . ; But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise .
Bmr010_1532	b	uh , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did . ; And one of those things , looking at the statistical component , ; One . ; Yeah .
Bns002_383	bk	Now the p ; until the reservation ; OK , ; yeah ,
Bdb001_265	bk	Yep . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr025_303	cc	Yeah . ; It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about ; and having the search tools and so on . ; We we can look into it ,
Bed008_338	b	OK . ; oh I see . ; If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2733	s	I mean , usually , um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often just sort of , um , segments ; Great . ; when there 's really long spaces , it segments random spaces in between . ; And th you know , they get that
Btr002_906	bh	OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse . ; Yeah . ; Oh . Do you drag do you drag the line ? ; Oh really ?
Btr001_2793	bk	Right . ; there you go . ; OK . ; OK .
Btr001_2144	b	people tend to end utterances quite often with " so " or " or " and trailing off . ; Oh , yes . ; M Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro010_1093	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Exactly . ; But that 's this afternoon 's meeting .
Bed008_112	%--	Right . ; And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid ; because um this case it 's pretty simple , ; but as we will see the other ones um
Bro021_1007	%--	uh , we we know that , for example , the log of E plus B is equal to log of E plus log to B . ; Right . ; And we can say here , it i ; Right . So you could s
Bmr002_1331	s	Whatever . ; People ; That 's what they 're using here . ; Yeah , people do different different ways ,
Bmr020_1611	%--	Yeah , ; You know , if they they hear you know , a dog bark and they say what was the word , ; it 's ; they you know , they
Btr001_1449	b	Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed , ; and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Btr001_982	s	Mm - hmm . ; And that they should be able to handle themselves , ; and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now , ; and those distinctions could be added later if needed
Bmr024_618	s	Where does this ? ; Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too , ; Well , ; or they 're different s speakers .
Bmr010_853	b	and I gotta ask you one thing about that . ; when ; So , um , ; Hmm .
Bmr020_586	2	Put the abstract end . ; Oh , I I ; you know the the gap between the two columns is like ten millimeters , ; Took out white space .
Bro026_993	%--	So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . ; Yeah . ; But but but we 're not trying for models of words here . ; See , so her here 's maybe where
Bmr026_679	s	uh , uh , ; Liz and Jane probably . ; OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting . ; Uh . Uh , if you wanna put it that way .
Bmr015_568	b	Or I don't know how to s say it . ; So I mean with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter w as a wireless . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr010_579	b	uh Well , th lemme ask you this . ; Yeah . ; It occurs to me one of my transcribers t told me today that she 'll be finished with one meeting , um , by ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1894	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore .
Bro014_1440	cc	What else ? ; Uh . Yeah , ; that 's all . ; So we 'll perhaps try to convince OGI people to use the new the new filters
Bed014_192	s	OGI has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone type voices that are really nice ; and we 're going to use that . ; We can still , um , d agree on a gender , if we want . ; So we still have male or female .
Bmr001_525	%	It 's just most of them are all zeroes . ; So that that 's on our list too . ; OK . ; Yeah , well that we can do something about .
Bmr015_791	%--	Yeah ? ; And so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gonna ? ; Well so the thing is that the ; This is for ,
Bed014_404	aa	knows , uh ; OK . ; Yeah , and and not even all of them really do . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1313	s	and , th like ; Excellent . ; couple keys that you used . ; Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them .
Buw001_2121	s	Yeah . It 's on I already added that one on my board to do that . ; So , uh ; uh , ; hopefully everybody here is on that list .
Bed014_1110	s	Perfect . Can you also write it up ? ; It 's like , " this is what we 're doing . ; Abso ; And the complement is Robert . "
Bmr011_1070	%--	And , um , I think with ; Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , ; right ? ; No , we used the fact that
Bed014_1250	%--	Yeah . ; That 's fine . ; Yep . ; I mean
Bmr002_749	ba	and then , back in here ; Oh , no ! ; It has the word " X M L " in it ! ; Oh , good .
Bro017_1320	aa	So . ; Hynek , I don't know if you 've ever done this . ; The way that it works is each person goes around in turn , and uh you say the transcript number and then you read the digits , the the strings of numbers as individual digits . ; No .
Bro012_226	b	Well , we tried we tried point one , ; I I 'm sorry ; f for point from You change at point one ; yeah .
Bmr007_1227	b	Right . ; Yeah , it 's not ; But I mean if you just replaced it with silence , it 's not clear whether that 's really silence or ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1196	s	because how do we know where to put beeps ? ; Is it i d y is it ; Oh , OK . ; So what it what it what it involves is is really a s uh , uh , the original pr procedure ,
Bro023_818	aa	OK . ; Mmm . ; Tha - that it ? ; Yep .
Bmr009_121	s	Yeah . ; Um . So that was that was the discussion we just had . ; Um . The other thing ; Actually we ca had a question for Adam in this .
Bro026_959	s	Right . ; But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . ; And so that feels I don't know how to get out of this . ; Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them .
Bed009_312	s	So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig ; um Robert didn't bring it today but there 's a a belief - net which is ; There 's a first cut at a belief - net that that doesn't it isn't fully uh instantiated , ; and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities aren't there .
Bns002_1548	no	P E I R E . ; You never heard from him ? ; No . ; I don't know .
Bns002_1515	s	and I got the statement ; uh they are very interested in that . ; They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom ; but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff .
Bed002_1125	s	a And so forth . ; So , ; that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . ; I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors .
Bro004_138	%--	and the fourth is ; W which in ; It has three languages . ; That 's including the w the the
Bmr018_135	s	Oh . ; and we do have the time work difference running the right way , ; but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven . ; It might end up really being twelve .
Bed012_191	aa	Wha ; Or i or i it 'll be tight . ; You won't it 'll be hard to decide . ; Yep .
Bmr023_785	b	uh ; you know , Chuck and I talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the um , the size of the Gaussian system , um , @ @ to to this to this feature vector , which we haven't done at all . ; We just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system . ; Hmm .
Bro027_461	s	so what is different between this and and what you ; So the previous syst ; It 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . ; It 's the same system .
Bmr018_1300	s	and video , right . ; And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room , ; uh , the yeah the the mikes in the middle , the head - mounted mikes , the lapel mikes , the array , uh , with ; well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine ,
Bmr007_1247	s	Ke - keep a back door . ; Well , the other thing that you know , I mean the the alternative might be to s ; Yeah . ; Well , I I haven't thrown away any of the meetings that I beeped .
Bro021_1175	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And I fix this for all the all the sentences . ; Uh , because
Bed015_598	b	But we know what it 's trying to say . ; We we know that it 's what predication it 's setting up . ; Y yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1125	s	oh yeah , ; I see , ; yeah yeah , really . ; First steps .
Bro023_1080	qw	But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction . ; Um , yeah . ; Right . ; What is it the , um , France Telecom system uses
Bed015_900	s	There are constrai yeah , it 's not every but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused .
Bed009_749	s	You have to do it , ; yeah . ; Yeah , ; ah and so things must be simpler
Bro019_1379	s	Yeah . ; Um , ; so , ; um , I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam .
Bro017_172	s	But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I don't think we did . ; Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data
Bro024_151	s	Um , I mean , on the one hand in a practical system if something is , uh , four point four percent error , four point one percent error , people won't really tell be able to tell the difference . ; On the other hand , when you 're doing , uh , research , you may , eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety - five percent accurate system to a ninety - eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent . ; So so the they they it 's I don't mean to say that they 're they 're irrelevant . ; Uh , they are relevant .
Bed016_345	%--	" Future activities " something . ; Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , ; then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking ; and , you know , the
Bmr016_574	s	it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors . ; And then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors , ; which you would expect ; but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth ,
Bro013_328	h	Um . ; Anything else ? ; Yeah . ; Well . So .
Bmr014_140	s	And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . ; Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is well , a couple things . ; First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . ; So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,
Bmr002_440	aa	And it it is a PC connection , ; Well , you know ; so it would have to go on a P C somewhere . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1184	%--	I guess , I My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and how to apply you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition . ; So not just ; Because I think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it . ; I think you have to have some kind of structure from the
Bmr026_214	s	but then you can't add our patches ; and then the the new version is is totally different ; Oh . ; a and in yeah , in terms of of the source code .
Btr001_2123	aa	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah . ; It 's OK .
Bmr026_1221	bk	Yeah . ; Oh I see , ; I see , ; yeah , of course .
Bmr029_951	s	And so , we have now the SUN in the library which can do that . ; And I looked into the ts F - zero thing and talked to to Liz , ; and it seems that it 's quite s what she wants , ; but we 'll have to think about the the energy thing
Bro013_688	s	But if you take , say , a two millisecond um window ; I 'm sorry ; a two second window ; then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window
Bed011_609	b	Right . ; Never . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed010_272	%--	Oh yeah yeah . ; OK . Anyway . ; So , the trip ; the report on these
Bmr016_520	bk	It 's great for the Germans . ; yeah . ; That 's German , yeah . ; Oh , oh !
Bro024_421	aa	Yeah . ; Do you wanna go , Barry ? ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bns001_273	s	u ; Me , on the other hand , I 'm more interested in uh , core service , or c core technology , myself . ; So I 'm u I was thinking about uh , how I could combine the both of them . ; KPN was , um they 're interested in having , uh like , six people or something , working on the project for one year
Buw001_1943	s	Yep . ; And Xerox . ; and ; So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox ,
Bed009_702	s	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Which is , you know , uh uh utopian ; completely utopian at the moment ,
Bmr001_425	g	Order of two . ; Cuz like , we don't Maybe we don't We don't need to save all channels , ; Factor of two . ; right ?
Bmr024_1563	b	Can you mix t uh , processors of different speed ? ; I don't think so . ; I think we 'd have to do all ; OK .
Bmr022_1007	%--	So so there 's a mike that plugs in ; You 're saying there 's a mike that plugs in to the IRAM board ? ; No , no , what I 'm saying is that we 're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure , d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot , ; or
Bmr001_173	s	So . ; I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still , which is um ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets , ; but there 's this amplification problem . ; I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy .
Bro021_378	aa	I ; The whatever you , uh , tested with recently . Right ? ; Mmm ? ; Yeah .
Bro027_271	bk	There was another short one , ; o o sample . ; yeah . ; OK .
Bsr001_2234	b	Robert 's rules . ; Yeah . ; cuz we are having we do have a more artificial set environment again . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_735	b	OK . ; Skateboards ; right , ; Right .
Btr001_2644	%--	Oh , it 's at the top . ; Yes , you run across that . ; Let 's see , ; I guess it would be
Bns001_507	s	So this architecture with m ; well , at least no wireless environment or a mobile IP environment , comparable to uh UMTS environments . We really did not find any well , difficulties there . ; On the blackboard , that is . ; Of course , in real life there will b probably be some problems .
Bmr014_712	s	right ? ; OK there 's ; I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . ; OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . "
Bmr008_636	s	and then in addition , add to it the third level of the balance , uh , um this this issue of not being too intrusive , asking in a way that they don't mind . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we release this corpus , what do we want , ; I mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended then you need someone needs to enter that ,
Bmr018_1298	s	which is the i interesting ; And cameras . ; and video , right . ; And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room ,
Bns003_856	s	Yeah . ; and this was , in principle ; OK , ; it 's it 's not really the subject
Bns001_1043	s	Well , users usage . ; I never saw a user using WAP . ; Please raise your hand , who is using WAP . ; My colleagues are .
Bsr001_745	b	Mm - hmm . ; And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bed006_855	s	S S ; OK , so one question . ; This was in this case it 's all um clear , sort of obvious , ; but you can think of the Enter , View and Approach as each having their roles ,
Bed003_704	bk	So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT ; So i wi th ; OK . ; Oh , I see ,
Btr001_75	g	Yeah . ; OK , ; good . ; It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ?
Bed003_1075	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So theoretically you could edit that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It just that it 's
Bro022_379	s	But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . ; Right ? ; So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate ; and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight .
Bro022_1124	%--	and I didn't work much on that . ; How about you , Carmen ? ; Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . ; And , one of the things that last week ,
Bed006_1198	s	No , no . ; There a a actually by I think my question is simpler than that , ; um is ; OK , so you have an SPG action
Bmr012_1026	s	um ; We can fit we have room for one more wireless ; and the wireless , ; this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars ,
Bmr016_1583	s	Mmm . ; The recognizer , it is funny . ; Kept getting PTA for PDA . ; This is close ,
Bed011_911	b	this is the part that needs the work . ; Right . ; Yeah , so ; Yeah .
Bed011_1038	s	Absolutely . ; and it you know it 's it 's sort of like anything goes . ; Like ; OK , so this is I think we 're gonna mainly work on with George .
Bed017_355	s	Anyway . ; So . So there i there are some some u uh , you know , uh , elaborations of this ; that you could try to put in to this structure , ; but I don't think it 's worth it now .
Bro021_916	%--	uh So that 's log of X plus log of one plus , uh ; Well . ; Is that right ? ; Log of
Bmr027_1131	%--	I mean , obviously . ; Yeah . ; Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval , ; cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , it 's , uh , uh
Bmr011_760	s	One of them is a graduate student in psychology . ; Um , Each I gave each of them , uh , their own data set . ; Two of them have already finished the data sets . ; And the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half .
Bed009_1045	b	OK . ; But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way . ; You get in trouble and you know et cetera ; Mmm .
Bmr014_6	%--	Are we going ? ; It is uh , must be February fifteenth . ; Yeah . ; Yu
Bsr001_1964	b	Well ; well , indeed . ; I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @ should be working on these type of things . At least , ; Mmm .
Btr001_2594	s	I remember I did that a little bit , ; Yeah , I did that once too . ; Yeah . ; and , yeah , you must have too .
Bmr008_133	qw	I mean , this this compared to , you know , wh exactly what level of professorship , and and ; Yep . ; Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that . ; You need to know sort of Bas - in in this meeting , sort of what is your social status ?
Bmr010_1030	b	I mean , they 're very perceptive . ; And and s several of them are trained in IPA . ; C they really could do phonetic transcription if if we wanted them to . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_952	no	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I don't remember there being an independent way of saying " we 're just gonna make them from here to here " . ; Use this analysis bandwidth or something . ; But I I I don't know ,
Bmr016_638	%--	Early on , yeah . ; and I wore the lapel once , ; and for me the lapel was OK . ; I mean I still
Bro016_191	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So that 's why I think ; that 's another reason other than curiosity as to why i it would in fact be kinda neat to find out if we 're way off .
Bro010_186	b	Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low uh , very very very narrow , uh , latency bound . ; And the people who have longer latency don't . ; So . ; Huh .
Bmr029_112	s	I don't know , ; something something like something between thirty and fifty hours , maybe . ; I f I forget the exac ; It 's around there .
Btr002_409	2	" gruesome " . ; You 've got the , uh , " S " in the middle . ; Yeah . If you if for some reason they didn't hear the " F " , if they didn't hear the " fuh " , it might just sound like ; " Gruesome " .
Bro027_1938	g	Somewhere around sixty , must be . ; Which is ; yeah . ; Right ?
Bmr006_219	aa	OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get . ; I mean , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , ; Yes , that 's fine . ; That 's fine .
Btr001_2436	bk	you know , ; so you don't offend me about how good my joke was . " ; You know , ; it 's almost like , " OK ,
Btr002_1238	s	Yeah . ; That was a that was really interesting to notice that . ; Uh , ; It 's a very different interface , though .
Bmr008_370	bk	Actually , " approximate " ? ; O opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ? ; Yeah , right . ; That 's right .
Bed015_888	s	Yeah , so b b but I think the poi ; I 'm not sure I understand ; but here 's what I th think is going on . ; That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus .
Bro028_210	b	Yeah . ; I mean , the VAD doesn't use the same features there are . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr018_1080	s	Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so . ; Cool . ; I thought it was higher than that , that 's pr ; It really it depends a lot .
Bed011_79	x	Any comments I can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly . ; m Yes . ; Let me summarize in two sentences , ; mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all .
Bsr001_1031	b	so it would be nice to work together . ; and would be great to com to to basically take advantage of that to to make a synergy more than an overlap , and , you know , help each other . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr013_71	s	we discussed this right before coffee ; and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , ; but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . ; And also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript
Btr002_1906	fa	Yeah . ; Yeah . Cool ! ; It 's really @ @ . ; It was fun .
Bmr027_432	s	and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that ; Mm - hmm . ; and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form ; that they 've already signed once .
Bro019_1514	s	So he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel - to - vowel transitions , ; and then he wanted a psycho - acoustic um , spectrum . ; And he wanted to look at um , how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum ; and compare that to the to the listener tests .
Bmr008_1229	2	So it sounds like having the facility is great , ; Mm - hmm . ; and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful ; Some more .
Btr001_386	b	Yeah . ; and ; Yeah , I had the same experience . ; Yeah .
Bro010_379	s	What is the advantage of that ? ; Uh ; Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , uh , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . ; And the other is linear but it 's not discriminant at all .
Bro012_29	s	For the P D ; Right . ; But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him ; and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , uh , many other problems could ha happen .
Bmr022_498	s	Yeah , if we if we did mod ten , then ; Yeah . ; Right , but my point was , you know , if It 's a big difference to me if there 's a thousand or there 's a hundred . ; If there 's a thousand , then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand .
Bmr006_373	s	Yep . ; And so , uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , " Oh , we 'll just do it up there , " ; OK . ; If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away .
Bmr009_364	bd	That was a great overlap by the way . ; What if it 's the case that when two people overlap they equate their you know , there 's a conservation of energy and everybody ; both people talk more softly ? ; I don't think this happens at all .
Bmr001_632	s	Right . ; I think we should read some more because because this is very f ; OK . ; we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more
Bro019_1284	s	What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that . ; Mm - hmm . ; That is just a binary feature ; and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise
Btr002_2979	s	Mm - hmm . ; Or if it 's @ @ then I then I put six or seven or however many it is ; Then ; That 's what I usually do too .
Bmr027_1109	s	and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance ; cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there . ; Yeah . So how often ? ; Yeah , but I bet I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though .
Bmr021_798	d	Um , and the Uh , ; so without adaptation , ; you had forty - nine p ; That 's error rate or recognition rate ?
Buw001_794	b	Couldn't find it ? ; And stored it on analog media . ; Hmm ? ; Hmm .
Bro021_810	%--	No , I do that two t did two time . ; but they use every all use a different one . ; I have an idea . ; If if , uh , uh ,
Bmr011_298	b	I forgot to do it . ; So . ; Yeah , OK . ; Yeah .
Bro027_479	s	the the latency of the VAD is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . ; And , uh , the VAD is used uh , i for on - line normalization , ; and it 's used before the delta computation . ; So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy ,
Bmr019_1365	s	Oh , I could ! ; I if it w ; Yeah . ; I could submit that to Aurora .
Bsr001_1127	b	and so they they basically wanted stuff anyway . ; OK . ; And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed . ; Hmm .
Bmr023_275	b	And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out . ; And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . ; OK . Do w do what Do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? ; Great .
Bmr026_1193	s	I mean . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more ; but it it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .
Bro021_1089	bk	But I I under I understand what you mean now . ; That 's true . ; That 's true . ; OK .
Bed006_489	s	The time is now pretty much fixed . ; It 's the last week of April until the fourth of May ; so it 's twenty - sixth through fourth . That they 'll be here . ; So it 's it 's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time .
Bro023_505	s	And they filter the original signal using that fil filter , ; which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up . ; So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice , ; but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level .
Bmr005_179	x	It 's in my notes . ; with gaze and no identification , ; or ; I just wrote this down .
Bro019_87	s	OK . ; We um ; Yeah ? ; So we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm .
Bro027_373	aa	Yeah , ; i that was a particular version . ; SUSI ; Yeah ,
Bmr002_626	bk	but I want to say that I know for a fact , I keep running across these , ; and those would be my first two choices of looking at . EAGLES and MATE . ; And I have the documentation downstairs . ; OK .
Bed015_1756	g	But it 's something ; Um . ; Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? ; we we were talking about sarcasm too , right ?
Bro026_567	%--	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ? ; Uh , I remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh , people 's features and then running them or they were gonna give the system out or
Bmr001_543	s	OK . ; What 's it do ? ; Um , it it does AR modeling ; and so it looks at a section , it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bits it can get away with .
Bed011_988	%--	And hopefully you can sort of also try to find out , you know , sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the ; Mm - hmm . ; mm - hmm . ; not the discourse , the utterance as it were , uh ,
Bmr003_1424	ba	And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab ; and it goes on to the next unit . ; Hmm . ; I mean , it 's very nicely thought out .
Bdb001_247	%--	I would say ; OK , so frame - level is probably not a good idea . ; And th it 's ; But for phone - level stuff it 's perfectly
Bmr022_128	bd	Oh ! ; Uh ; Yeah , just say , " OK , is " ten minutes is " ; I mean , maybe there 's other things to do that are more clever ,
Bmr019_1982	bk	And then then we can sing them next time . ; Uh . OK , why don't we go ? ; Uh , one two three Go ! ; OK .
Bro013_670	%--	because it seems like the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of of certain um words and stuff ; So , um . ; Yeah . ; Just
Bed017_525	bk	cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , ; and I 'm guessing that you you won't be doing that ? ; No . ; OK .
Bmr027_573	b	W ; For this set , I 'm not worried , ; because we basically know everyone on it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1445	h	Yeah . ; OK . ; Uh , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source , ; Uh ,
Bmr019_1750	g	but , eh , the following @ @ scholarship , eh , eh , eh , will be here more time , ; because eh , i in my opinion is is better , eh , for us to to spend more time here ; and to work more time i i in a topic . ; No ?
Bmr009_1041	qw	Yeah , I certainly don't . ; I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak . ; It 's like Northwest ; Oh , what is Northern ?
Bmr005_78	s	Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , ; and uh , the need to build in , um , this this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . ; And he gave the example in his talk about how um , ; e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now ,
Btr002_1481	aa	Yeah . ; And then down here you have the soundwave , ; and then something down here , ; Exactly .
Bmr010_655	b	And there 's no adaptor for it ? ; Seems like there 'd be a ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed011_1051	g	Of course . ; Right , exactly . ; Now it w we talked about this before , ; right .
Bed003_184	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; Hmm . ; Right .
Bmr031_1355	b	Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect . ; OK . ; So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1092	bd	No , right , I didn't mean to imply that that we that that we shouldn't discuss this now , ; Yeah . ; but I 'm I 'm just saying that ; Oh , not right now ,
Bro017_511	b	So . ; And Harry said " Yeah . ; But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . " ; Hmm .
Bmr028_1078	s	OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and the other thing This would kind of be a Hail Mary , ; but but , uh Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits ,
Bed013_918	co	I don't know . ; That 's so great . ; There 's maybe a different ; So wait ,
Bmr007_1333	b	Well , I can wear it , I mean if you ; Oh . ; It doesn't matter . ; OK .
Bmr031_1405	s	So y you have to you have to do everything at the feature level . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . But , um , um ; but there 's , uh , you know , Wiener filtering and spectral subtraction
Bmr020_157	b	Well ; there there were some interesting results in this paper , though . ; For instance that Morgan uh , accounted for fifty - six percent of the Robustness meetings in terms of number of words . ; Wow .
Bro024_652	b	I mean , this this is basically because it gets stuck in some local minimum in the training . ; That seventy - five point seven nine in the Finnish mismatch which is that the eleven point nine six what we see . ; Uh - huh . ; Mmm .
Bro027_1944	b	Yeah . ; Right ? ; If everything is five percent . ; Yeah .
Bed013_887	b	Cool Keith . ; You know , these are our , whatever , belief - net decision nodes , ; and they all contribute to these things down here . ; Oh , oh .
Buw001_306	b	and at the very least . ; Mm - hmm . ; I actually want to say something about the note pad . ; Yeah
Btr002_218	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah , I would just sort of end it . ; Yes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1178	b	So . If you if you run it on the new version , then the numbers will be um , and you compare it to the to runs on the old version , then you 're gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case . ; Hmm . ; Different . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_631	s	And the second use , um , is in FrameNet. It 's ; slightly different . ; Oh , I was asking Hans about this . ; They use it to really mean , um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required .
Bro014_144	no	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , ; I 've forgotten now what the name of that machine is
Btr002_897	bk	" shift " , what is it ? ; " backspace " . ; Oh , OK . So you just do it that way . ; " Shift " , " backspace " to c collapse it , yeah .
Bro010_1051	bk	Now this was coming at it from a different angle ; but maybe it 's a good way to start . ; Uh , these are things which , uh , John felt that a a , uh a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . ; Oh , OK .
Bro022_149	ba	and ; I guess that 's that 's it . ; Any any questions ? ; Sounds good .
Buw001_1512	s	Because uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is . ; If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , ; Oh , that 's true . ; we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data .
Bro018_99	aa	Right . S ; S ; Well , I can also th use this . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_419	s	Right . ; Hmm . ; And then and then ; the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel ,
Bro014_1266	bk	it 's the excitation " . ; But it 's not really the excitation . ; It 's whatever it is that 's different between ; Oh .
Bmr010_1426	%--	This is the idea . ; And so I I think it would work fine for detecting overlap . ; It 's just , uh , that i it ; he has the two - pass issue that
Bmr019_1438	bk	No . I mean , this it it 's the HTK that is trained on a very limited amount of data . ; It 's d it 's very specific . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_175	s	These the These are the the first experiments uh with comment uh ; Sorry . ; Frame energy . ; Except that it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized .
Bmr006_1235	b	right ? ; S Right . ; I mean , I know I n I know that 's a very important cue . ; Yep .
Bro014_1470	aa	Um , ; and he 's been doing all the talking ; but but these he 's he 's , uh ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1506	s	And then there 's , you know Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it is it is it , uh , delta of those things ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , what is it no ; Obviously , just a simple number absolute number isn't gonna work .
Bro028_31	s	or just ? ; It 's the main conference call . ; OK . ; Uh , yeah . There were like two hours of discussions ,
Bed003_1351	b	Right . ; so I don't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro016_222	b	but it it it wouldn't surprise me if there 's still ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , in in the the the old systems we used to do , I I uh , I remember numbers kind of like insertions being half the number of deletions , as being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to to , uh , substitutions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1614	bk	Is it changed now , or ? ; I hadn't heard back from Mari after I I u u uh , brought up the point abou about Andreas 's schedule . ; So , um , maybe when I get back there 'll be some some mail from her . ; OK .
Bed014_1354	s	Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah . We actually have I think we have been making progress , ; and its sort of surprising .
Bns001_1472	s	That 's right . ; But in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework with the relevant technology . ; Real technology . ; Maybe you can start with GPS or or UMTS , or whatever .
Bmr016_772	s	Great . ; and it does all sorts of matches ; because the way people filled out names is different on every single file ; so it does a very fuzzy sort of match .
Bmr010_1406	bk	Oh , it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal , uh ? ; I thought it ; Maybe I 'm misremembering , but I did not think it had a Markov ; Yeah .
Bro012_310	s	when we did this tweaking of the self - loop ? ; Yeah . ; The silence model expected duration was really different . ; And so in the case where um it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer .
Bro022_732	aa	I mean , it 's ; Yeah . ; I see . ; Oh , so , OK .
Btr002_2492	%--	That 's true . Yeah . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so that
Bmr024_1460	%--	So we com we do a , you know , w um We collect the uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train . ; And then , from there we do , ; um ; There 's a lot of ,
Bed002_67	s	So , don't worry too much about it . ; The It 's just self rating . ; Um . ; And I think that 's about it .
Bro004_1287	%--	but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . ; And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh , look at stuff and and and compare things . ; So I think that 's that 's pretty good . ; Um I don't know what the
Bmr018_995	ba	if we can't then we can fake it even if we 're we report , you know , we 're wrong twenty percent of the time or ten percent of the time . ; Well , I 'm thinking ; are you talking about for a paper , or are talking about for the corpus . ; Uh uh , that 's a good question actually .
Bro005_1189	s	which is a kind of LogRASTA , ; it 's just that they have the ; I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , ; and it 's it uh it 's just that they d it 's trained up ,
Bmr012_132	s	W we don't care how they old they really are . ; Well well I don't know . ; Yes . Unless we wanna send them a card . ; Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gonna be collected for .
Bed014_83	s	The uh , Java the embedded Bayes wants to take input uh , uh , a Bayes - net in in some Java notation ; and Eva is using the Xalan style sheet processor to convert the XML that 's output by the Java Bayes for the into the , uh , E Bayes input . ; Mmm . ; Actually , maybe I could try , like , emailing the guy
Buw001_79	b	It 's a ; This w ; Alright . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_351	s	But that 's pretty uncommon . ; Um , if we could really get one percent on ; Well , I guess yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits . ; We should be able to .
Bmr007_566	t3	say , because there 's a lot of that . ; Uh , to distinguish between , say , backchannels precision timing Sort of you know , benevolent overlaps , and and and w and and sort of , um I don't know , hostile overlaps , where someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else . ; Mm - hmm . ; Let 's pick a different word .
Bmr009_526	ar	Yeah . ; and I agree with you it 's better to I suppose it 's better to to consider the the energy this kind of parameter bef ; Yeah . ; Oh , that 's not what I meant .
Bro028_1048	s	it 's a simple method , ; but I kinda like it . ; Um , there 's a a old , old method for feature selection . ; I mean , eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago ,
Bmr015_1101	s	Wh - what ; And you wanna be sure it 's used , ; and you wanna be sure it 's done as efficiently as possible , ; and if it can be done automatically , that would be ideal .
Bmr024_944	s	On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . ; But , uh I I you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails . ; Mmm . ; And they do .
Bmr028_779	qrr	So what I need to do is , make it so that the the Quicknet stuff can read those . ; And , uh ; I is that independent ; or related to also being able to write out the , uh , feature file i in the SRI format
Btr001_903	b	mm - hmm . ; PRN . ; How it was really pronounced ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_1067	b	Yeah , yeah . ; OK . ; That 's just what they the word they used in that paper . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1874	%--	Right , right , but , ; Right . ; No , no . ; Anyway , so so , um , I guess
Bed015_1319	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; even though saying that place takes place , whatever . ; Uh , if y if I said " time " is , you know , " past " , that would say " set that this world " , you know , " somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time " .
Bed008_636	co	I see . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; So uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that .
Bed005_1215	%--	Yeah , whatever . ; Yeah . ; So Eh Um ; Well , my point was more that we just eh
Bro005_1104	b	I mean we can just take the re their training files also . ; But . But , uh ; just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another ; Mmm .
Bed013_908	bk	Mmm . OK . ; I 'd I 'd never seen it before either . ; OK . Just t ; Cool .
Bro028_684	s	is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , um , uh , values that come out of the net , ; which are something like log probabilities , ; and scale those . ; And then , uh , um then at least those things would have the right values
Bmr022_1138	%	Well I p At this point ; Well , with CVS , though , you don't actually have to do it that way . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro013_59	bk	It 's quite significant . ; Yeah . ; Oh . ; OK .
Bro014_1235	b	This is this ? ; More close . Is this ? ; And this . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1293	%--	Hmm ? ; i You know , might as well . ; We - I ju Otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline . ; I don't know , m
Bro018_494	%--	And then the other thing that we were discussing was was um OK , how do you get the your training data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz uh the Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years , ; and
Bed015_225	ba	Like ; That - b ; Right . ; Minor min problem
Bed005_449	s	So ; Oh . ; It d it n That 's because ; So , it 's not just that it 's adding that field .
Bmr003_2274	s	I agree . ; And I 'm I 'm just not sure what that is . ; I mean , some sort of cabinet . ; Well I can build a cabinet .
Bmr003_968	ba	but , yes . ; So . ; So I I need to we need to look at what what the final output is ; but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words .
Bro017_699	qrr	Everything is fixed . ; And is this something that you would adjust for training ? ; Each each ; or only recognition ?
Bmr002_390	bk	The other thing is is that we might be ; Oh . ; Oh , I see . ; OK .
Bmr001_545	s	Um , it it does AR modeling ; and so it looks at a section , it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bits it can get away with . ; Something like that . ; So I think it On on each block it 'll it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits .
Bed003_616	t1	That all you want ? ; Yes . ; OK . ; So let 's see .
Buw001_1468	%	I mean , there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . ; OK . ; And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1281	s	I do it uh again this ; develop . ; Estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech . ; And with th with this new s new mean and variance I estimate again this .
Bsr001_936	b	I notice that they they s they sa have some help with control of what person to pick up . ; Mixing , ; yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1453	s	which e ; It may or may not be a just a pain ; it 's it 's ; I 'm completely willing to to to throw all of this away
Bmr014_595	%--	Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ? ; Yeah . ; No . ; Uh , I mmm , use some some different features but not not
Bed015_2167	s	but there but but the , um , The cove the the P R Ms are like rules of inference ; and you 're you 're coupling a bunch of them together . ; Mm - hmm , yeah . ; And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely .
Bro021_697	s	And it it it gave , like I just got the signal out ; and it it was OK . ; So , I plugged it in somewhere ; and then I mean , it 's like I had to remove some part
Bmr024_31	b	So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll we 'll get to it and talk about it ? ; The SmartKom data ? ; Yeah , right . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3439	s	Well , I guess I 'll start . ; OK . ; Transc - And the time is OK . Um , ; O eight . OK , I wanted to make one comment and that is , some of these are like two digits
Bed009_475	%--	OK th ; I 'll I 'll talk to Michael ; it 's what I do anyway . ; Who How far is the uh the the M - three - L specification for for the la natural language input gone on the the uh
Bdb001_148	s	Right . ; That 's , the who that 's why you do that extra level of indirection . ; So that you can just change the time - line . ; Except the time - line is gonna be huge .
Bed008_116	qw	for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? ; So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . ; Hmm . ; How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ?
Bro005_620	b	um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , ; um . ; So we 'll perhaps start something next week . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_453	s	right ? ; Well , I have it structured . ; Right ? ; So each type tag has only particular items that it can take .
Bmr024_1208	s	Yeah . ; we had reached the point where , um , on the male portion of the development set , the , um or one of the development sets , I should say the , um the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features . ; which are MFCC . ; So , um , then I thought , " Oh , great .
Bmr007_26	bd	Yeah . ; Just just to be consistent , from here on in at least , that that we 'll do it at the end . ; The new consent form . ; It 's uh Yeah , it doesn't matter .
Bmr022_1148	s	Right ? ; Right . ; I mean , it 's not like it 's one or the other . ; We can do both .
Bmr020_1087	bk	So ; for the minimum silence length . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see .
Bmr006_846	b	Yeah . Yeah , I I don't think we were asking for that . ; OK . ; We were jus just trying to understand ; Yeah .
Bns003_789	%--	Uh ? ; But I think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings . ; So ; how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and
Bmr019_908	s	But , yeah , we should try to use what you have . ; I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one . ; Oh , good . ; I I mean the the one with Dan Ellis in it and Eric .
Bed012_950	aa	Yeah . If the if your if your brain was totally non - deterministic , then perhaps there 's a way to get , uh , infin an infinite number of constructions that you 'd have to worry about . ; But , I mean , in the practical sense , it 's impossible . ; Right . Cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons ? ; Yeah .
Bmr014_295	b	Yeah , he might he might be asking ; You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr014_156	s	So , um . ; And ; So let 's see we ; So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .
Bro027_1172	b	And ; Yeah . ; Because ; Mmm
Buw001_1765	s	Well ; uh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with .
Bmr008_1421	s	No . ; OK . ; It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . ; So that 's why it doesn't add up down
Bro027_1252	%--	So it 's only the highly mismatched ? ; And it Remind me again , ; the " highly mismatched " means that the ; Clean training and
Btr002_1819	b	People shifting into a kind of a comic voice , ; Mm - hmm . ; or sort of a mock - this or mock - that , ; Mmm .
Bmr009_573	s	You 'd be much better at doing it also ; because you know , I I 'm not I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out , ; Interesting . ; and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to .
Bmr024_407	g	Your mike is a little low there . ; I in Berkeley , yeah . ; So , uh You you have to go a little early , ; right ?
Bmr013_908	s	or Uh , ; so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . ; Yeah . ; So a lot of little details ,
Bed016_861	s	th these are you 're addressing like , computational linguists , ; right . ; Or are you ? ; There 's gonna be four computational linguists ,
Bed010_742	cc	Oh . Wow . ; yeah . ; Circuits . ; So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .
Bro021_1148	b	I don't know exactly . ; Yeah . ; I I need to s ; Yeah .
Bed014_717	s	Oh , wel Well , the ar the The argument is that you 're gonna have the ; If you 've recognized the word , ; you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , ; so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a uh , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering .
Bmr008_715	aa	and now list the ones in first grade ; and now list the ones your friends speak " ; Sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bro023_1520	%--	And this tile ; Uh , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound , ; because it 's it 's the FTT bins . ; And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile ,
Bsr001_1399	aa	You know , ; not not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these , um , pieces . ; Uh - huh . ; That 's right .
Buw001_1047	aa	I 'm much faster typing than anything else . ; and th and closest to the meeting time too , ; cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1289	ba	So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions . ; He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement . ; OK . ; The the It 's a good suggestion .
Bmr018_156	b	and it was fine with the beeps ; they would be That 's easy for them to do . ; Great . ; OK .
Bed008_1205	bk	HTML ? ; Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing ; and then li consider that it 's respective , ; OK .
Bns001_990	%--	But but still a le d it 's a it 's a fundamental ; Huh . ; Yeah . ; uh it 's a part of a of design like the the
Bed013_213	s	Which is very th very large . ; Oh ! That 's n ; Oh . ; that 's that 's nothing for those neural guys .
Bro013_437	s	OK . ; No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . ; But only to play . ; And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the um mel filter bank .
Bmr027_1077	ba	Discourse markers . ; Sure . Sure , sure , sure . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; And it 's and it makes sense
Bed006_111	bc	and um ; Not witch - like . ; Wizardette . ; Wizard .
Bro003_194	b	I should tell him about the cube ? ; Yeah . ; Oh ! Cube . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1259	fa	Cuz I had a question on what what this meant . ; I 'm still doing the overview . ; I haven't actually gotten here yet . ; Oh I 'm sorry .
Buw001_160	%--	Should we have used pseudo - names ? ; Should we do it a second time with pseudo ; No . No . ; I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel
Bro027_56	aa	No , ; the edge . ; The edge is really , uh , sixty - four ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_619	b	Mmm . ; you know , we had the MFCC 's before , ; lots of people have done voice activity detectors , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_576	b	No , it was one like one ribbon for everybody ; No . ; Oh , wow . ; Euh .
Bro016_800	b	well , ; at the log , perhaps , ; and ; Yeah .
Bed013_184	s	Yes . And come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes . ; Which , if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent answer out of that , will give us the intention ex nihilo . ; And that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance , ; it would be b based on that extension , ex nihilo ,
Bed009_79	bk	I mean it makes sense , ; doesn't it ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah Good .
Bed011_494	b	Yeah , in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each in common , ; like at you know , " attend a theater , symphony or opera " is is a group , ; and " tour the university , castle or zoo " , ; mm - hmm Yeah .
Bdb001_204	s	or or any frame - level stuff I would use P - file . ; Meaning ? ; Uh , that 's a well , or something like it . ; It 's ICS uh , ICSI has a format for frame - level representation of features .
Bmr013_297	s	because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . ; Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , ; but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . ; Uh , he didn't know what to say , about , what is the sequence of phones there .
Bmr010_1571	%	Right . So if we if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong . ; uh Yeah . ; The ; N n Yeah .
Btr002_1006	ba	The little accent thingy . ; Right . ; " I don't want you ! " ; Yeah , I do that too .
Bmr022_680	s	yeah . ; I guess also even for the transcribers , it 's quicker to load a smaller file ; into the You know , t for the checking problem . ; Yeah , I mean , we could certainly break the meetings
Bro021_1325	%--	This is this is , uh ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; The question is , um , whether it would be helpful , i particularly if you used if you had more ; So , suppose you did
Bmr009_889	s	Well , because If y your your professional use , ; you 're gonna already have the date , and the s ; What which form are you talking about ? ; Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one .
Bro017_1003	b	Yeah . ; And then do a whole bunch of those . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_368	s	We can ; yeah . ; Sure . ; But we have to decide
Btr002_1382	b	Yep . ; and things covering several screens ; and it 's just horribly i inefficient , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_412	ba	Yeah . ; all the acoustic stuff that like Dan Ellis and and company want to do . ; Oh I see . ; Digits are nice and well behaved ,
Bro004_231	b	Yeah , it 's around one point one . ; Right . ; And if it 's ; Yeah .
Btr002_1517	s	which means it 's more stretched out , right ? ; I wouldn't use that unless I was trying to get to a whole different part of the ; Right . Right . Right . Right . ; Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um , point five second intervals on the numbers .
Bed008_328	s	Alright . ; You know , but that was actually , ; yeah unfortunately that was a um kind of an intermediate versio ; that 's I don't think what we would currently do .
Bro024_214	s	Is is that right ? ; Or for these long analysis windows , I guess , is the right way to put it . ; I guess , the the the issue I was the general issue I was bringing up was that if you 're have a moving moving window , uh , a wa a a set of weights times things that , uh , move along , shift along in time , that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter . ; And you just happened to have picked a particular one by setting all the weights to be equal .
Bro026_623	b	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; Um , some of that may be , uh , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing ; Yeah .
Bed011_1088	aa	but ; Yeah . ; For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_343	%--	So , that 's ; Fine , yeah . ; that 's shouldn't be too tough . ; Yeah , so where are those
Bed015_1254	s	This is just basically says ; It 's a grab bag of ; " part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas . ; Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there " .
Bed003_1353	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr012_402	s	Right . ; and Switchboard - two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic ; Excellent . ; and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one
Bro017_1108	co	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And we 'll just ; Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with .
Bmr028_1536	s	Yeah . ; That 's ; we weren't . ; That 's why we increased the error rate .
Bro028_1	s	 ;  ; Eh , we should be going . ; So ne next week we 'll have , uh , both Birger and , uh , Mike Michael
Bmr008_1533	t1	Here in the yeah it it 's a new new a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone . ; Nope , not the last page . ; Um . ; Where was it ?
Bmr026_489	bs	Yep . ; So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . ; So there 's what ; thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?
Bmr023_257	b	Yeah . With my ; Oh , right . ; Oh that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1485	aa	Yeah . ; So tha so we 'll you know , maybe you guys 'll have have one . ; Uh , you you and , uh and Dan have have a paper that that 's going in . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_862	%--	I think that 's the bad idea . ; I know where you 're going . ; Oh . ; See because you 're gon you 're uh
Bmr031_345	b	And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time ; for our transcribers to process things before and after , ; if they really have taken out enough of the of the , uh , uh , work that that it 's f feasible , then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_47	qrr	But I am not sure this is decided yet . ; Um . ; And and i when they 're talking about it , do you have the impression that they 're talking about a particular VAD which everybody would use ? ; or or just that everybody would use the same procedure ?
Bed014_1431	s	Bummer . ; What about What about DDR ? ; It 's almost true . ; Oh , I don't have it this weekend ,
Bmr003_753	s	So that seems to work really well . ; That 's ideal . ; Um . ; Although I was I you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , recently was , um that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time i t pre - marked
Bed016_922	aa	But um , ; those are interesting examples ; but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1427	s	Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , ; but ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah , it might be that LDA could be better .
Bed006_596	s	Mm - hmm . ; So maybe there 's something better happening there . ; And then you get you 're shown what movies play which films , ; and it 's gonna be of course all the Heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing .
Bro010_408	s	Maybe . ; Could be . ; Good good to know . ; But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction ,
Bmr010_703	s	And ; so people who were working on the on their ViaVoice dictation product . ; Yeah . ; And they said , uh , the breathing is really a a terrible problem for them ,
Bsr001_2106	ba	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's kind of amazing too that , you know , the transcription tool we just converged on the same ; Mm - hmm . ; this is great " .
Bmr011_100	%--	Right ? ; Is that is that basically the point ? ; Ri - um , ; yeah , the
Bed003_911	s	Has it become all point fives or not ? ; Oh , right . ; Let 's see . ; So this is " has door "
Bro021_1103	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . Right . ; Right . ; Now it 's correct .
Bed014_507	%	So I a I I th I agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every uh , pragmatic reading , ; Mm - hmm . ; although there are some that will need to be there . ; Good .
Bmr029_325	g	Right . ; S six hour test set . ; Six meetings . OK . ; You know ?
Bmr007_320	s	And then it would be harder ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I should also say I did a simplifying , uh count in that if A was speaking B overlapped with A and then A came back again and overlapped with B again ,
Bed003_1324	b	Or or any good old Pink Floyd concert . ; I see . ; If you want to see " The Magic Flute " or something . ; Yeah .
Bro023_137	%--	Mm - hmm . ; The other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , ; and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , ; and when you were six
Bed016_889	s	Yeah . ; So if you c we really just construe it as a ; Around ? ; No , it 's the bakery itself
Bro012_347	%	Right . ; Sorry . ; So um , how 's it going on the ; Um .
Bro025_208	b	Mm - hmm . ; where we 're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT 's ; that that have you know , which could be turned into speech ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_271	b	" Can I go there tomorrow ? " ; or you know influences ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1498	s	This is really really helpful . ; yeah . ; functionally pretty , you know , also ; It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , uh , I guess two nights ago ,
Bro013_550	bk	Well , this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter , ; simply isn't ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed003_585	s	I don't know , ; say they discussed the admission fee ; OK . ; and uh the place has nice walls
Bmr021_576	%--	uh uh uh ; I wouldn't just wanna change them you know , without some advance notice . ; Right . ; I mean , th that 's all these segment names that we we 've been using .
Bro023_1054	2	I mean , his number is still better than what I got in the two stages of Wiener filtering . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; On Italian .
Bmr019_1839	ba	Oh . ; Very nice . ; Tha - that 's that looks great . ; Oh , wow .
Bed015_1986	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , uh ; Um , yeah , there should be I I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , ; yeah .
Bro027_2002	g	So , uh , Sunil will be in Oregon . ; Uh , Stephane and I will be in Denmark . ; Uh ; Right ?
Bmr015_429	qo	Mm - hmm . ; and this time they came up with a middle one , ; so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big . ; If we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to ,
Bmr020_1284	b	Mm - hmm . ; So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed015_1809	b	Certainly not as some ; hhh , I don't know , m ; Well , they 're intonational markers I think for the most part . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_1009	s	And this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it . ; Hmm . ; And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . ; It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well ,
Bro010_637	aa	But it 's hard to ; i ; but that 's hard to do . ; Yeah ,
Bmr006_1681	b	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so . ; Ugh , that 's a problem . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1322	s	So I don't think I 've ever ; The IBM ones were the ones that came in huge , huge paragraphs , huh ? ; Yes ! ; Yeah , and we had to split them up .
Bed006_550	aap	Is that right ? ; Yeah . ; So the basic requirement fulfilled . ; Um , the basic requirement is fulfilled almost .
Bmr014_263	co	Yeah , OK . ; Good . ; Yeah . ; So let 's go with that .
Bmr026_813	%--	So , we cou ; Yeah . ; That 's the the the ; There 's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end
Bns002_740	%--	and because we wanted to to compare our algorithm with something , we needed to compare it with the no power control , ; which is the usual uh mechanism at this eh media access control level . ; So , what we are doing here is to to compare our mechanism against the no power control , ; but again we have to fix
Bmr001_794	s	And uh we 'll see which one of those seems closest to right ; and if they ramped up , if towards the end it was faster you know , get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it ; Mm - hmm . ; and um then uh like I say , check it out with an external service and see if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever .
Bed005_555	aa	It 's a design thing , not a political thing . ; Yeah . ; Once we 've eh We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done . ; Exactly .
Bns001_1178	b	So that you really have a complete a complete scenario . ; As it What I mean , the synergy effect , right ? ; From from ; Yeah .
Btr001_474	s	Yeah . ; But , I mean , I did find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot . ; I can imagine that , ; I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , " I can see how you how you couldn't understand that " ,
Bed016_1049	b	you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , ; I don't know . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Bns001_839	qh	" Network Services and Applications " . ; So , everything in the world . ; OK . ; Or is the application related to the network ?
Bro014_209	h	So . That 's it . ; Alright . ; So what else ? ; Um .
Bro023_998	%--	and , ; mmm ; So what I did is , uh , some kind of nonlinear smoothing . ; Actually I have a recursion that computes
Bro003_847	aa	but they also included the the noise files for us , ; right ? ; Or ; Yeah .
Bro017_392	bk	But you probably won't have anything before the next time we have to evaluate , ; right ? ; Probably not . ; Yeah .
Bed011_136	s	And um And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? ; Something ? ; Yeah . ; And more and more every day .
Bro023_565	s	So Well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments ; and then they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence ; but they keep , uh , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech . ; And they keep the speech pauses also .
Bmr020_962	bk	yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I just wanted to make sure that it was clear . ; Yeah ,
Bed006_719	s	Spit right here . ; and right now the way the interface is " action go " and then they have the what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type " going into " , goes of type " want to go to a place where I can take a picture of " , et cetera .
Bns001_1494	s	There 's not the selling idea behind it . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; if you go with something what what Wilbert mentioned " OK , let 's have this one here " . We have a new PCMCIA card and and extend something and the end system , or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter - working in the end s , then you have an an a device which you can sell .
Bro011_295	aa	it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . ; Hmm . ; Oh the What we talked about yesterday ? ; Yes .
Bro022_1024	bk	Yeah . ; SpeechDat - Car Italian . ; So , in some cases s there are also ; Yeah .
Bed006_1364	%--	So that the um the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do ? ; Hmm . ; I 'd I ; I think I 'd
Bed012_446	%--	Because there are interdependencies , ; right ? ; The uh ; Uh , no . So if if for example , the Go - there posterior possibility is so high , um ,
Bmr011_511	%--	right ? ; Yeah , our block of wood is unique . ; Yeah . ; But the But the
Bmr019_1812	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Why is it that I can read your mind ? ; Well , we 've gotta wait until after di after we take the mikes off .
Bed014_1340	b	I think it 's good when we 're ; when we 're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in in English or in German , in particular , whatever , that 's great , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2765	%	Sure . ; Whatever . ; We ; Sure .
Bmr013_947	cc	And I just don't know , ; I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , uh , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . ; That 's very important . ; I have to run it .
Bed010_864	2	OK ? ; is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh ; Yeah . ; Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this ,
Bmr018_169	bk	but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything . ; OK .
Bro005_89	b	yeah . ; OK . ; And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . ; Yes .
Bmr030_139	s	which was the display of like , you know ; Oh ! ; And and all I said was oh just cycle through with Alt Tab ; Not the slide show .
Bed008_1432	g	you know , ; I mean that seems like that 'd be weird , ; Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . ; right ?
Bmr027_850	s	Right . ; I mean ; It 's not that you 've looked at it , ; it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions .
Bmr014_437	s	cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . ; That was what I was always planing on . ; So that , you know you get a whole long list ; exactly what you 're saying ,
Bmr008_994	s	And there are people who haven't ever lived in an English speaking country and who are superb . ; However , um , that 's you know I do think it 's a pretty good indicator . ; Mmm . ; And then there will be people who live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language .
Btr001_1458	ba	Oh , wow . ; Huh . ; Oh . ; Hmm , wow .
Bmr007_818	s	Ah ! ; OK . ; Say that again ? ; Frame over fres threshold .
Bro023_1740	s	and , um , ; also to , um , try different kind of features , uh , as input to the VAD network . ; And ; we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try
Bro028_1170	s	And so , ; um , at the end of the day you have this neural net ; and it has hidden hidden units . ; And each of these hidden units is um , is learning some sort of pattern .
Btr002_2863	s	and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions , ; or e not enough overlaps , or something . ; Huh ! ; It wasn't interruptions
Bmr011_944	s	And especially since a lot of these ; Uh , it sort of depends where you are in ; Yeah . ; But I mean we had this we 've had this discussion many times .
Bmr023_523	b	So . ; Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? ; The other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ could 've been transcribed in the other way . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1208	s	and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you merge everything in terms of , you know , linearizing the sequence based on the time marks . ; And then you extract the individual channels again ,
Bro010_272	b	and then the the microscope would start moving or something . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr031_1521	s	But ; OK . ; So . Go ahead , Jeremy . ; Right . So I 've been looking at spectral tilt
Bro026_560	ar	Very good question . ; Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ? ; Sorry . ; No .
Bmr016_954	ba	And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions ; Uh , you can get rid of ; is that you could run all the English speaking , ; Yeah , it it 's a lot faster .
Bdb001_605	qw	Right . ; Yeah , but ; But but so how in the NIST format do we express a hierarchical relationship between , um , say , an utterance and the words within it ? ; So how do you tell that these are the words that belong to that utterance ?
Bro024_1103	%--	Oh . ; It 's ; Wait a minute . ; It 's
Bmr014_1021	s	I don't know ; I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented , ; Oh yeah yeah ; oh I know .
Bro010_356	s	Also we were thinking to to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; and to to change the contextual KLT for LDA .
Bmr031_546	bk	No . I don't think so . ; No . So I think they they have actually a very large audio data rate . ; I think it is comparable to a video data rate . ; OK .
Bmr025_1009	s	but isn't that funny sounding ? ; " We ordered more wireless . " ; It 's like wires are the things ; so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing .
Bed014_707	s	But somehow you want to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , it 's just another , sort of , construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history ; or changing of the probabilities , and - or
Bmr011_445	s	OK . ; Is he involved in ; Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . ; NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software .
Bed009_230	s	what we can get from the utterance . ; That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently ; whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . ; And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was .
Bed016_443	br	Including cr cross - bridges , ; O ; and ; What ?
Bmr002_1341	qw	Well , so , um ; What is the plan ? ; We 're gonna ; I mean , How many How many How many meetings ?
Bro024_807	aa	s ; Thanks Adam . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr011_1511	b	Well , OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Exactly . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1879	b	Yeah . ; and I 'm also interested in prosody , um , use you know , u used over person to person stuff ; like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff . ; Right .
Bro013_765	b	See . I mean , you 'd have to tell them " OK when we write this , say it tha " , ; you know , ; and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1136	s	That 's great . ; Mm - hmm . ; Reminds me of when th when Herve and I were first playing with c uh , context - dependent things for nets , ; and and at one point we took out the speech input ,
Bns002_811	s	Motion will be important for routing , ; but for the media access control level , we are considering that motion can be con is not is not important . ; OK ? ; Yeah , what I think Maybe some , uh cases why I go this way with my node , and suddenly , I s go out of the scope of the transmission area ,
Bmr005_813	s	And , it seems to work , ; I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , ; and I haven't ; I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into Transcriber .
Bmr001_824	s	There 's supposed to be some out out out - of - work shepherders or something in Scotland but ; Yeah . ; Ah , the internet . ; They should all be in India right now .
Bmr003_1658	%--	Uh , yeah , ; it seems like ; it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these automatic speaker detection turn placing things . ; Because suddenly
Bmr031_1069	ba	and it comes up , you know , in a couple of seconds . ; Um . ; u Do you take do you take feature requests ? ; Cool .
Buw001_1298	ba	Me too , me too , me too . ; Yeah . ; On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? ; That 's fine .
Bed003_196	g	Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be ; Wouldn't couldn't they also be ; They 're not exclusive groups , ; are they ?
Bmr022_670	%--	If so , if that doesn't add time for them , that 'd be great . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; You know , like
Btr002_671	bk	Yes . ; In the some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes , ; or what I called spikes . ; Yes .
Bro021_1328	s	So , suppose you did ; This is almost cheating . ; It certainly isn't real - time . ; But if y suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given by the VAD and so forth
Bmr008_1516	%--	then um , voiced regions would be , like , probably more informative , for energy ; Yeah . ; because ; Right , so you could do something like , uh
Bmr016_325	b	and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data ; because you might be wearing a different microphone ; and , I mean so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know , replicated many times . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2815	b	Yeah , so . ; So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_694	s	Really ? ; I mean , it ; Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . ; I wanna just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as I want .
Bed002_1118	s	And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . ; But that 's that 's fine ; an and um , ; all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind .
Bro013_654	s	and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M ; so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we uh you know , uh model the time series that that happens ; um and and we talked a little bit about factorial H M Ms and how um when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for for these H M ; and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't um don't over - alert the problem
Bmr010_720	s	So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I remember when I was when I I I I used , uh , um , a prominent laboratory 's , uh , uh , speech recognizer
Bmr024_247	bk	So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and and that 's that 's what my goal is . ; Package of twenty hours right now , and then once that 's done , move on to the next . ; Yeah , uh , ; so twenty hours .
Btr002_994	aa	Mmm . ; and so I 'll al I 'll just be ; if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just ; Oh yeah .
Bmr008_233	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; because they were " post " their " doc " ; Right .
Bmr028_776	s	And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate the P - files I need . ; Cuz we already have the feature files in the SRI format . ; Mm - hmm . ; So what I need to do is , make it so that the the Quicknet stuff can read those .
Btr001_64	b	Yeah , ; Uh - huh . ; but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_337	aa	I mean Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Absolutely . Yeah , absolutely .
Bed014_763	b	Now it 's not . Yay ! ; I know it is . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro005_281	s	Then we can use ; well , OGI , they use MFCC th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization ; Oh , I 'm sorry , ; I k I keep getting confused
Bro027_1943	s	Well , it 's around five percent , because it 's s ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; If everything is five percent .
Bmr012_330	s	that 's why we only have twenty minutes ; but there 's a significant amount of ; Non - zero ? ; Um there are like more cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,
Buw001_409	b	I don't know how to do it if until you have a system . ; The summary is actually gonna drive the queries then . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bro011_394	s	right ? ; I mean I can't remember where uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of ; Yeah . ; I remember there was this guy at A T - andT ,
Bro005_1080	b	yeah ? ; So they will send us the Well , provide us with the feature files , ; I see . ; I see .
Bmr013_99	s	But , either way . ; Yeah . ; Yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this Aurora , uh data set . ; And , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about ,
Bed004_525	s	I mean , that 's what you do . ; Ev - every landmark you take a picture of , ; Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible . ; you enter
Buw001_2009	s	Mm - hmm . ; So . ; So it also depends on the style of the group of people . ; Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting .
Bsr001_2034	%	Yes , ; yeah , yeah . ; that 's right , ; not , but
Bmr005_944	qw	just cuz I 'm ; I wanted to get a feel for that ; to sort of be able to know what what can be done first ; and like how many meetings are we recording
Bro027_729	s	Point s ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; And our system was forty - nine ,
Bro004_977	ar	one single KL to transform everything ; or uh , ; Right . ; No
Bmr011_1327	s	Good . ; Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , ; because they have ; And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here
Bmr020_1563	qo	It 's just wasted time . ; Yeah . ; And th and that 's for a good meeting . ; Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've you 've had some more trouble with ?
Bns002_799	s	thirty meters per second . ; OK ? ; Oh yeah , something like that . ; So in in eight milliseconds , well , the amount of of space you are travelling is not too much .
Bro027_767	s	um ; Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car ; which is a hard task , ; cuz it 's really , um I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be .
Bmr020_1367	bk	And that 's what 's slow . ; There 's no adjusting of time boundaries . ; Well , eh , listening does take time too . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1624	b	Mm - hmm . ; So I I have , like , some experiments running , I don't have the results . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_397	s	Uh Well ; I just approved all mine . ; I didn't look at them . ; I sort of spot - checked .
Bmr008_1600	%--	Yeah . ; but I mean , if um u ; Yeah . ; as I understand it , you have you have some regions that uh um are marked , as
Bed005_927	%--	Right . ; Right . ; Got it . ; Is that
Bro019_278	b	I I 'm not sure how that works . ; Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bro008_378	b	Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone and noisy speech testing , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_512	s	Yeah . ; So time and space . ; Um , we 'll we 'll get that on the other side a little , like very minimally . ; There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place .
Bro019_1281	s	Yeah , ; I can I will try to do that . ; Yeah . ; What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that .
Bmr020_588	s	you know the the gap between the two columns is like ten millimeters , ; Took out white space . ; Yeah . ; so I d shrunk it to eight millimeters
Bed003_1467	%--	doesn't that ring a bell ? ; I think it has to exist somewhere . ; Yeah ; but I don't know if it 's still
Bro013_764	s	OK . ; See . I mean , you 'd have to tell them " OK when we write this , say it tha " , ; you know , ; and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would
Bed013_774	s	yeah , looking at that paper that that you had , I mean you know , like , you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the XML cases or whatever ; you just sorta said well , you know , here 's the general idea , ; some stuff gets put in there . ; You know , hopefully you can you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of , you know , without going into this intense detail .
Bro011_129	bk	Mm - hmm . ; And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , ; so . ; OK .
Bmr005_900	s	They they ; Di - dif different different bandwidth . ; They ; I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers .
Bed005_1236	%	But , um ; The ; I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that . ; Yep .
Bdb001_708	bk	one to the sent ; So so what you would end up having is a tag saying " here 's a word , ; and it starts here and it ends here " . ; Right .
Bro003_1862	b	No , it 's it 's saying ; It uses special diacritics and stuff , which you can't do with ASCII characters . ; y can't print on ASCII . ; Yeah .
Bed005_990	b	That 's why they invented " pocket T 's " . ; They have clips ! ; exactly ; Huh .
Bed004_482	s	This is sort of th the second version and I I I look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John Johno said . ; We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract . ; Yeah . ; But the uh the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully
Bed004_796	s	But um , I 'm sure the " what 's this ? " questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects . ; Could be . ; So . ; I 'm not a I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task ,
Bns003_603	bk	Yeah . ; I 'm kind of lost for the NSA group . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1207	s	Mm - hmm . ; so being able to find where so - and - so talked about such - and - such , ; then , um , um ; e I mean , I I I did sort of a a rough pass on encoding , like , episode - like level things on the , uh , transcribed meeting
Btr002_2475	b	I 'm not gonna do it ; cuz I don't really know how to do lipsmack . ; But but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture , ; Yeah .
Bro023_911	s	So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is . ; Then you 're subtracting that from another chunk , ; Mm - hmm . ; and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , uh , be negative in some places .
Bmr027_251	s	I I think that there 's one missing line . ; Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth . ; Mm - hmm . ; And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you .
Bro027_525	%--	Forty ; And then forty ; This forty plus twenty , plus one hundred . ; forty p
Bns001_857	s	Because Hannes was an expert for that . ; So the problem for me , it still exists that we have , in principle , here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side . ; We could have a certain kind of application ; and there 's a lot of activities in the outside world
Bro023_35	ba	He 's , uh , um , very , very , easygoing , ; easy to talk to , ; and , uh , very interested in everything . ; Really nice guy .
Bmr007_773	b	I mean I I could tell you I mean , if I if I 'm in certain meetings I notice that there are certain people who really do eh The body language is very uh is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect . ; And And ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bns003_106	s	No . ; and even maybe to to , uh put your I G M P stuff on it . ; Eh ; No promises .
Bed012_647	%--	OK , that was ; OK . That makes a lot more sense to me now . ; Yep . ; Cuz I thought it was like , that one in Stuart 's book about , you know , the
Bns002_493	g	So when this node hears the CTS transmission that is performed by the receiver , this will be uh informed , that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it 's area . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK ?
Bed008_1533	s	the figure I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , ; fifty constructions or whatever ; that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions ; and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer
Bmr029_151	b	just for for one gender . ; That 's what I was thinking . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1930	bk	Yeah . ; If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch , it 's around , yeah , maybe five . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bro025_714	%--	just looking at the data and seeing what 's similar and what 's not similar . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I 'm I 'm , um , taking a look at some of , um , Sangita 's work on on TRAPS . ; She did something where , um w where the TRAPS learn
Bmr009_550	s	I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . ; So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal , ; Uh - huh . ; and I had plan to go through with it , of of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s just with reference to speaker style so , you know , with reference
Bed004_398	co	w Uh , go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something . ; Well I OK , I just ; Say what you were gonna say . ; Good , do it !
Bmr025_431	b	either uh information on users because the user database is that way ; I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m uh various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings ; Cool . ; Yeah .
Bro027_930	s	except it was noisier . ; Uh - huh . ; Right ? ; In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all .
Bmr026_1051	co	Or should I just go straight to ; Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer ; or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign . ; Try it .
Bmr009_532	s	Well , we certainly should see this but I I I I think that the harm ; I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things ; I was just saying ; I I go on with the with the pitch ,
Bro027_1057	s	but they 're pretty correlated with one another . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; they 're being fed into these , uh , variants , only Gaussians and so forth ,
Bmr001_770	b	and we could do and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only , you know you only you cut it out when there 's no energy . ; Oh , that would be interesting . ; So you don't @ @ noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_704	bd	it looks really good . ; Yeah , it does look good . ; I mean , I found several errors , ; but they were not significant .
Bed003_1439	s	huh ? ; And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than " New York " , ; huh ? ; inferring everything from the context .
Bmr018_755	s	and ; Yeah . ; um , but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't ; I guess it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now ,
Btr001_1436	aa	You know , ; and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . ; But with nine speakers ; Eee ! Yeah .
Bed016_782	g	Yeah , is film the trajector ? ; so like the the film went away from where it should be , ; namely with you , or something , ; right ?
Btr001_62	aa	Parentheses , meaning uncertainty . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_701	s	I mean , like the sort of the tourist - y bits ; Everywhere . ; is it like ; you can't get to the Philosophers ' Way very well ,
Bns003_695	b	You you have to to pass the different tests ; and you have to study the different subjects . ; And , until you have finished with this , uh well OK , you can do it by by your own , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_2300	ba	OK . ; I think we 're done . ; OK . ; Great .
Bro019_491	b	Yeah , ; and I I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm . ; I mean , so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried , ; Yeah .
Bro024_264	%--	Oh , well , no . ; I guess not . ; Yeah . ; But
Bed008_988	bk	OK . ; And if he has seen it already or not and so forth , ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr028_442	s	So . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; In somebody else 's turn .
Buw001_1177	aa	It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free ; Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . ; Action ; Yeah .
Bro014_1046	b	Yeah . I think we have linear interpolation . ; So we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank , ; mmm Yeah , it 's linear . ; Mmm .
Bed003_1097	s	That might be worth it . ; And that might do . ; Yeah . ; I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability
Bns001_1025	b	But , I don't see that uh ; It 's too late , I believe . ; If WAP was available in the beginning of GSM , then I think it was there would be a good chance that it is well - deployed . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_92	s	We have a little more to discuss . ; Yeah . ; But , uh , we 're we 're basically ready to do it . ; And , uh , I have some web pages on ts more of the background .
Bro022_283	s	because yo ; Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either . ; Yeah . ; I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .
Bed011_426	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It feels like forever when you 're doing it , ; but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds .
Bro008_149	b	uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . ; But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using ; because these , uh , standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1643	%--	OK . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; So the uh
Bmr027_1297	bk	OK . That 's fine . ; Do when when is this planned for roughly ? ; They should be I I imagine next week or something . ; OK .
Bdb001_96	s	We don't know when it ends . ; OK . ; Right ? ; But it ends at this T - eighteen ,
Bed015_1230	b	You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity , ; you know , not don't have it here . ; And then have it part of the speech - act in some way . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_1217	s	And it wasn't trained on this task either . ; And it wasn't trained on this task . ; Actually one percent is sort of you know , sort of in a reasonable range . ; People would say " yeah , I could I can imagine getting that " .
Bro011_705	%--	So . ; Cool . ; OK . ; So uh what 's uh
Bro016_1119	s	and sometimes it may not . ; It just depen maybe depends on the context , ; things like that . ; And so it 's sort of a different way of looking .
Bmr014_867	%--	You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . ; Because nob you ; know it ; There was a
Bed008_1454	b	right ? ; Right , right . ; Which is slightly tricky . ; Right .
Bmr024_1002	s	Mm - hmm . ; Ah . ; But normally you 're correct . ; But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated .
Bmr028_1267	bk	There 's a difference ; I mean , if you re - ran the recognition , then you just run it ; Right . Right . ; Oh , I see .
Bed014_1216	s	um ; Skolemization . ; Hmm ? ; In in logic , it 's it 's @ @ it 's actual Huh ?
Btr001_2558	%--	that 's my recollection of all of our meetings together " . ; Oh my God . ; Oh , no . ; They have this really nice
Bmr002_1127	b	listened to them in stereo . ; Huh . ; And I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers , ; Neat !
Bed013_1346	b	like , ; with context and enough user information , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_955	s	Yeah . ; Uh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; I 've heard that that that sometimes .
Bro014_1222	t3	For ; Yeah . ; I have the mean . ; Well , I mean for the the energy .
Bmr006_1152	b	Because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you ; I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult ; because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . ; Right .
Bro016_95	%--	How how much , uh , does it improve if you actually adjust that ? ; OK . ; But it is interesting . ; You say you you have for the noisy
Bed004_357	s	Mm - hmm . ; so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly . ; Um , " Goal " . ; Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed
Bmr009_910	s	Yeah . ; and everything below the line is digits that the user reads . ; OK . ; Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here ,
Bed016_418	aa	Mmm . ; Hmm ? ; Propagated ? ; Yes .
Buw001_1331	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around
Bmr015_365	b	Very very , ; because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_690	aa	Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah sure .
Bed003_190	aa	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bmr007_1213	s	I think the beep is a really good idea . ; It 's very clear . ; Yeah . ; Then you don't think it 's a long pause .
Btr001_346	s	And and m eh the way he said " mixed " was really strange , too . ; Ah ! ; " Miss - ed " . ; " Meexe " , " meese " , " mees - uh " , or something .
Bro021_503	b	That will be really interesting to see , ; you know . ; So then you 're gonna feed the those into some standard recognizer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1487	s	Right . ; You know , that you have it without it , ; then you have the LDA , ; then you have the neural net ,
Bmr024_271	s	And correcting . ; I mean Correcting . ; Correcting . ; We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections .
Bmr027_1094	%--	This was changed to an acronym initially ; and it should shouldn't have been . ; And then , you can see here " GPS " was misinterpreted . ; It 's just totally understanda
Bsr001_1526	qy	we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece . ; OK , OK . ; That 's good . ; And do you have the same agenda , although there 's a goal ?
Bro013_663	b	and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot ; and um ; yeah , I 've just been continue reading um about certain things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_54	s	I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people . ; OK , so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota ; it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . ; And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this .
Bmr006_1749	b	And that violates our privacy issue . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_872	%--	but overall people are talking about technical topics . ; Nobody 's gonna get hurt . ; Nobody 's being l libeled . ; You know , this is this we 're we 're covering
Bmr020_1039	s	OK . ; I mean some cases , there 're some people um , who who have very long segments of discourse where , you know , they 'll they 'll breath and then I put a break . ; Mm - hmm . ; But other than that , it 's really pretty continuous
Bmr012_1272	s	like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does ; but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , ; you know it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that ; and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .
Bed009_1095	b	and that 's their goal ; and there will be additional situational information . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , OK .
Bed010_308	b	but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline . ; Anyth - any other uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? ; uh we so we now know I think , what the landscape is like . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_448	s	Right . ; So , um , um I 'm I 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , ; and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , ; you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens
Bed011_535	b	That 's right . ; Yeah . ; So , alright , so let 's go let 's go back then , to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see how we 're doing . ; Yep .
Bmr003_2407	ba	but I mean that 's fine . ; That 's that 's what it does , ; OK , ; great ,
Buw001_1060	aa	But but i ; Yeah , read the digits , ; do the summary . ; Right .
Bro019_181	bk	Well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt ; and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , ; so it 's sort of a sharing thing . ; OK .
Buw001_606	no	Y you should also have a record of what 's on the board . ; They 're very sparse . ; I mean , I find it very hard to reconstruct what 's going on . ; I I don't know how
Bmr008_60	cc	um At least that would get at some idea of their background . ; So I have a And s ; Well and it 's also relevant to status . ; I c I can insert that .
Bro005_151	s	Yes , and the baseline the baseline have i is eighty - two . ; Baseline is eighty - two . ; Yeah ; So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this .
Bmr013_272	s	Mm - hmm . ; Which which are all like where where your tongue comes to rest . ; Uvular . ; Place of ar place of articulation .
Bmr022_1032	%	but you could use Bluetooth . ; Wh - whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor . ; I don't remember what it 's called . ; Hmm .
Bro016_307	%--	But then ; I mean , Andreas gave a very reasonable response , ; and he 's probably not gonna be the only one who 's gonna say this in the future ; of , you know ,
Bed016_563	b	And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , ; that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors ; so that all of the projections of it also should work . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1158	b	Right , ; So , I mean ; you know you know , where r ; Yeah .
Bro024_190	aa	Uh , yeah , ; I don't I don't think the TI - digits data that I have , um , i is would be appropriate for that . ; Yeah , probably not . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_185	2	You 're probably wondering why I brought you all here today . ; Right . ; But before w before we ; Before that .
Bmr019_1034	s	Well , but it 's interesting ; cuz , uh ; while people are talking to each other . ; There you go .
Bed009_1040	%--	So a typical one in this formulation is a container . ; So this is a static thing . ; And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers . ; Going in and out the portals and con
Btr002_2552	b	Yeah . ; It 's like a m sort of more surprise , or engagement ? ; Yeah . ; " Hmm . "
Bed015_840	s	OK . ; And that 's also mostly true for read speech . ; In in real speech , um , people may put stress . ; It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts .
Bmr022_796	s	It 's I I understand , ; that 's fine with me . ; I I g would say that um , I find this model easier to adjust , ; that 's one of the reasons I don't like these ,
Bmr031_1479	b	So . ; We we talked about something a ways back and I sort of lost track of it , ; about having a synthesizer driven with ; Yeah .
Bmr030_523	aa	And all of the P Cs are connected to the network , too , here . ; What i ; Or , uh , ; Right .
Bmr019_432	%--	No , my my But this is too big for my head . ; Uh ; So , I mean , it doesn't you know , it 's sit ; Well , if you 'd rather have this one then it 's
Bed008_317	b	But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . ; So this was adjusted for this one mode thing . ; Oh yes . ; Yeah .
Bro010_951	bk	you 've probably done stuff where you have , um , done separate , uh , Viterbis on the different ; Yeah . ; Forced alignment on the sub - band labels ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_374	b	So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node ; and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , ; so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1354	bk	We can do that as well . ; Uh , is that OK ? ; Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower . ; Alright .
Bmr024_1129	b	Um , it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . ; OK . ; It just queues it up and and when it 's available , it will copy it . ; Yeah .
Bro023_210	%--	And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing . ; Oh , ; so you you cache the utterances ? ; That 's how you get your ,
Bmr010_1543	qw	eh , using the the mark , eh , by hand , eh , eh , to distinguish be mmm , to train overlapping zone and speech zone . I mean , ; eh , I I I think that an interesting , eh , experiment , eh , could be , th eh , to prove that , mmm , if s ; we suppose that , eh , the the first step I mean , the the classifier ; what
Bro026_916	s	right ? ; So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . ; So , what are we bringing to the party ? ; I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .
Bro019_1255	s	So , ; um , ; uh , ; It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA ,
Bmr019_1500	s	So , um , ; uh , a colleague at SRI developed a improved version of MMIE training . ; Uh - huh . ; And he tested it mostly on digits
Bmr015_623	%--	Th - it 's necessary to have it more tightly tuned than that . ; OK . ; And w and w and , you know , is a It would be wonderful if , uh , it 's possible then to use that algorithm to more tightly tie in all the channels after that ; but , um , you know , I 've th the
Bmr003_489	b	I knew that they they had had some funding problems in completing it ; but , um , ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_252	bk	And this vector can be a a s assigned to s some phoneme . ; Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector . ; And you can try to classify based on that . ; Hmm .
Bed005_513	s	Then the next thing we talked about is actually , um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that . ; OK . ; Point number two . ; I got the , uh , M - three - L for the routes today .
Buw001_982	s	It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality . ; But I think it definitely ; Mm - hmm . ; if they exist .
Bro018_217	bk	No for , ; yes f ; I don't remember for voice - unvoice , ; Oh , OK .
Bro027_1978	bk	I 'm leaving leaving next Wednesday . ; Uh - huh . ; This afternoon uh ; Oh , right ,
Bed002_127	s	your give give your e normal schpiel . ; OK . ; So th ; Um . So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder
Bed005_768	bk	O or or tower , or this tower , or that building , or ; Uniquely . ; hmm ? ; OK .
Bmr003_1441	b	Mm - hmm . ; And this could be something that was handled by a table or something ; but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1738	b	I 'm sure if we uh , ; You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? ; I 'm sure we can get other people around who don't know anything um , if we want another subject . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns001_1517	t3	We have some content . ; We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned . ; Bless you . ; Bless you .
Bmr009_1390	s	Pennsylvania is not ; " Other " , ; it goes under " Other " , ; definitely under " Other " .
Bed014_1103	b	Cuz then you 'll find out more of what we 're making you do . ; Yep , and then ; Yeah . ; Hmm , hmm .
Bro003_170	s	And then the remaining part , I use for testing and with other kind of noises . ; So we can ; So this is almost ready . ; I 'm preparing the the HTK baseline for this task .
Bro024_62	s	um , but , for I tried twelve seconds in train . ; And I tried , um , um , the same in train ; I 'm a I tried six seconds in train . ; And six seconds in train was about point three percent better .
Bns002_1522	s	Yeah . ; Spanish . ; Maybe we have a better expert to pronounce it . ; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia
Bmr030_326	bk	No , we grabbed most of it . ; Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff . ; Ah . ; I see .
Bmr003_245	aa	Distribute what ? ; Hmm ? ; The data ? ; Right .
Bmr018_1055	h	Right . ; but the speech from the a actual other channels . ; Oh , oh , I see . ; Um ,
Btr001_2188	aa	but that it 's not necessarily final . ; Like that you 're flexible ? ; Like , you can ; Right .
Bmr005_791	%--	we have the close - talking mike , ; so I mean it seems like one kind of project ; that 's not perfect , but ; um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know ,
Bro018_425	s	so so I thought , make sure somebody go . ; Yeah . ; Do have Have people sort of stopped going to ICASSP in recent years ? ; Um , people are less consistent about going to ICASSP
Bro012_867	b	OK . ; OK . ; because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1216	%--	sort of like a , um ; it 's like a manifest , when you get a box full of stuff , ; Mm - hmm . ; or or if that 's , um
Bro013_273	s	Yeah . ; Uh . Yeah and again , you know , i that 's true either way . ; I mean so take a look at the uh um , the SRI results . ; I mean , they 're much much better ,
Bmr007_916	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , the you know , the reason that he , uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better , it was it was it was the place he was starting . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro022_1088	s	OK . ; So it has , like the spectrogram has , like ; Uh , ; it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of I mean , the the begin and the end of the speech .
Bns001_1695	qw	yeah ? ; or something like ; or over ether ; Why ?
Bmr009_105	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah , eith eith uh B ; Something like that where it 's sort of data driven . ; Yeah , but I think also u I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is , when the two speaker
Bmr003_376	s	got to finish this meeting . ; Tear t Tear your clothing off to stay cool . ; That 's right . ; Actually , the a th air the air conditioning 's still working ,
Bed015_1778	ba	About . ; It 's about ; Oh , that in that use of " about " , yeah . ; clever .
Bed008_136	%--	Um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , ; he is he cheap , average , or spendy ? ; Alright . ; And um I didn't come uh
Btr001_1264	%	No it doesn't to me either ; Like " that 's not a syntactic part of that sentence " . ; Yeah . ; If
Buw001_8	s	We 're not recording yet , are we ? ; Well , I don't think ; No . ; No , uh , that that wasn't recorded .
Bed002_374	qw	And , the the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . ; And we think it 's well - formed . ; So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain . ; So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ?
Bmr030_494	b	So what we do is , uh , when I go to um , select meetings for IBM , I go into the um ; well , into the the , uh , master sheet here with the statuses ; Master . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_957	%--	So the the only issue is then if we need access to them . ; Right . ; So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them . ; Well , if if if you if they last
Bmr005_1308	s	Well yeah , ; you know . You could . ; or just if you 're if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um have them do the digits , or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do . ; We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .
Bed013_720	s	Would that be clear in the paper or not ? ; That would be clear , ; we would ; I I mailed around a little paper that I have
Bro024_1393	bk	the first frame of speech ; or ; So there are some utterances where it 's almost one hundred percent VAD performance . ; Hmm .
Bed017_711	s	And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , ; but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , ; so digital divide and stuff like that . ; So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you .
Bro012_1260	s	That But ; OK . ; So that 's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector . ; They didn't .
Bro018_1030	s	I would think that you might wanna do something like uh you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors . ; That 's ; Right . ; Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take um a couple of the utterances that he had run through ,
Bns002_874	b	But , this probably , doesn't l look like uh something very very uh very likely . ; OK ? ; because well , l probably y what you will have will be some neighbors that are really close ; Hmm .
Bed011_317	b	That was the first subject . ; Yeah . ; First one wasn't very good . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_168	bk	and and th here 's a case where of course , human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results , and and , so , might as well do this . ; Yeah , when this is what This is actually when Jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data . ; Yeah . ; Well , fair enough .
Btr002_913	s	See , I never I never do that for some reason . ; I don't do that either . ; I didn't n even even know you could do that . ; I vary .
Bed010_819	b	right ? ; And so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_386	s	and , ; um , how the construction and simulation ; that ho that whole th ; Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide ,
Bed003_101	s	Thank you . ; uh , of a of a building . ; Whether the ; and this i we actually have a separate feature
Bed016_993	b	Hmm . ; www . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr018_307	fa	Uh - huh ! ; It will it will miss ; Yeah , you have to say " uh - huh " more slowly to to get c ; Sorry .
Bro005_306	s	Yeah . ; And And um ; whatever the normalization , actually . ; If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent .
Bed013_718	s	Mm - hmm . ; But then in the end we 're not doing like those things right yet , right ? ; Would that be clear in the paper or not ? ; That would be clear ,
Bmr010_360	b	Oh , that 's ; So so so this is so i it 'll happen . ; this is a new development . ; OK .
Bmr007_663	b	but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can . ; Can . ; Well , OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_162	s	I mean ; Well , I don't know it Overall ; Uh , I I don't remember , ; but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation .
Bmr024_1447	aa	And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full whole hog . ; Mm - hmm . ; Could be . ; Yeah .
Bro013_112	%--	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; But what would be interesting to see also is what what
Bdb001_1088	b	And so then it would just be a matter of getting making sure to handle the annotations that are , you know , not at the word - level and , um , t to import the ; Where are those annotations coming from ? ; Well , right now , I g Jane would would ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_141	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Alright . ; This is a modest amount of data . ; Yeah .
Bro007_123	aa	uh so the third and the fifth line of the table ; For this one . ; So filt is what that is ? ; Filt , yeah
Bro013_255	b	I listened . ; It 's quite different . ; TI - digit is it 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_104	s	And , uh , in fact , there are a lot of of research uh articles about this this kind of networks because You know , uh , mmm infrastructure - based network network has been a long topic of research . ; So , ; for example , routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched ; but it has an important background .
Buw001_470	s	and I don't think anyone is still working on it . ; I think they 're done . ; Yeah . ; Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes .
Bmr005_95	s	You know . So it 's the it 's i What you what you int what you draw you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording , ; Hmm , metaphorically . ; that um , i that i we have enough space , ; and he continues , like " we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling " .
Bro012_647	b	Yeah . ; So it would be for the first deadline . ; Maybe . ; Yeah .
Bro016_712	%--	OK . ; Y you 're you were saying before ? ; Uh . Yeah . ; So , this noise ,
Bdb001_71	t1	So that , ; um ; so that you start with with a time - line tag . ; " Time - line " .
Bmr016_1932	s	And , um , ; d ; Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , ; and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob uh p uh , things .
Bro023_954	s	Yeah , yeah . ; So , um , ; uh , ; i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , " well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation " .
Bro021_1347	bk	No , I won't ask the next question then . ; Oh , it 's it 's the for me it 's the first time that I am working with VTS . ; Uh ; Yeah .
Bro013_456	s	Mm - hmm . ; which are the variance of it and ; I have here . ; I have here for one signal , for one frame .
Bro004_1205	s	Ah . ; They they clearly did actually remove silent sections ; in order because they got these word error rate results . ; So um I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this
Bmr011_1187	s	And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes the ; and maybe it 's already finished ; the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps . ; Uh , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps .
Bro010_929	s	uh , what should we be training these intermediate things for ? ; I mean , because , uh , we don't know uh , that this is a particularly good feature . ; I mean , there 's no way , uh ; someone in the audience yesterday was asking , " well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? "
Bmr019_1744	b	and could start off from where you are also , you know . ; They 'd make use of of what you 've done . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_504	%	I mean , that I guess it 's a question that ; It 's a hassle ; uh , yeah . ; if
Bed010_654	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Those are two - point . ; Right .
Bro019_1425	bk	Mmm . ; Oh . ; It looked ; OK ,
Bro012_1078	s	Yeah . ; Um . We should ask which VAD she used . ; I don't @ @ . ; He Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of from OGI
Bro005_74	%--	And ; Mmm , Yeah . ; And f also for Italian , actually . ; If you take the second set of experiment for Italian ,
Bed004_534	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; And it it would do us no good . ; That
Btr001_1487	b	And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together . ; Cuz ; y OK . ; Huh .
Buw001_825	s	There you go . ; And so that could argue for us not doing it ; or it could argue for us doing it . ; The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , um , easier made easier if you had the video .
Bns002_170	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So , if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bmr019_549	b	because that could be why the PDA is worse . ; Because it 's further away from most of the people reading digits . ; It 's further away . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed013_176	s	Well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes . ; OK . ; You could even say , " let 's take all the priors , ; let 's observe nothing " , and query all the posterior probabilities .
Btr001_2700	s	one or the other . ; I see , ; so that 's why . ; But we converted them to this format ,
Bed017_466	s	where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , ; and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , ; rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . ; So these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the ideas .
Bro019_1159	%--	Yeah . ; And if the variance is small , maybe you have uh , speech . ; Uh - huh . ; To to
Bmr015_646	bd	which is what I wanna do , ; an analysis of that , ; then that really does require listening to every single channel all the way through the entire length for all the different speakers . ; Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time ,
Bro028_252	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Um ; Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation
Bmr013_595	%--	Right . ; so , that 's that 's great for for my purpose . ; And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . ; Well we did the hand
Bmr015_691	s	But I have problem ; because , eh , I get , eh , ; eh , ; very much harmonics now .
Buw001_935	s	So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . ; Yeah , I 'm not sure . ; I think it it it will again depend on Landay , ; and if he has a student who 's interested ,
Bmr005_731	b	but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . ; Yeah . ; Whereas th i I would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . ; Uh - huh .
Bed005_1495	s	OK . ; I think ; OK . And I I 'll I 'll think s through this , uh , eh getting EVA vectors dynamically out of ontologies one more time ; because I s I I I 'm not quite sure whether we all think of the same thing or not , here .
Bmr007_1243	s	Yeah , I like that . ; Very clear . ; Very clear . ; Uh , it 's it 's potentially audible , you could potentially recover it .
Bmr011_1249	aap	That 's nice . ; I mean , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to ; Acoustic features versus psychological categories . ; Sort of .
Bro012_222	%--	A tenth of a per cent . ; Even tenth of a percent ? ; Yeah . ; From point
Bmr022_523	s	So . ; Well , and the other thing is , maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process ; Yeah . ; It might make the transcript faster
Bed002_1133	%--	That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML . ; Uh , you could have an X yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure . ; So r ; That that
Bmr024_1471	s	And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model , ; Yeah . ; and you do four iterations of that . ; So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models .
Bmr028_1570	s	It 's pejorative towards ; I understand . ; It 's pejorative to o ourselves . ; I I wanted to raise the issue .
Btr001_2456	%--	Be polite , or whatever . ; or ; Yeah . ; Or how long do you wait after the joke
Bed006_565	bs	if if something actually happens and some answers come out , then we 're done . ; Mm - hmm . ; If and they 're kind of correct . ; So it 's not done basically .
Bmr020_234	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and so they 're so good that generally , u the overlapped speech does not is less than five percent .
Bro028_297	b	Yeah . ; Um , ; well , you can argue , that , uh that this is not speech , ; Yeah .
Bed013_969	s	And that might , you know , give us additional input to belief A versus B . ; Or E versus A . ; So it 's not just a particular word 's ; OK , so the you 're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to sorry , a few specific cues to some intention .
Bro022_830	b	Yeah . ; It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . ; But but ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1042	bk	I 'll do it . ; But he 's not gonna even read that . ; I know . ; Oh .
Bed003_602	bk	Alright . ; And it 's night . ; Oh , they ; OK .
Bed015_1540	b	Mmm . ; And and so we 're , uh gonna have to , um , chain those as well . ; Mm - hmm . ; Twhhh - whhh .
Bed006_1214	no	uh maybe I 'd ; The uh ; These actions ; I don't know if I 'm gonna answer your question or not with this ,
Bmr019_763	%--	you know , it needs to differentiate between the two . ; So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues . ; Right . ; And another one is turns , like people starting with " well I think "
Bmr008_1605	b	right ? ; and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked " SPK " , and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them , ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bed008_1425	bk	OK . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; OK .
Bns001_1022	%--	Yeah . ; But @ @ ; of the contents , in principle . ; But , I don't see that uh
Bmr009_308	b	and so it 's nice to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form . ; There 's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny funny way . ; But it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones , at least , have have some uh some hope ; Yeah .
Bro022_579	%--	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; They have tied states ; and I think
Bmr021_175	b	It depends on how good the mike is . ; Oh that 's way more than I thought . ; I ; Yeah .
Bmr001_164	s	Yeah . ; So . ; But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible . ; Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say " yes , this is where we do such - and - such " , and then be able to see uh , you know , some kind of I mean it 's less important than doing what we 're doing right now
Bro003_910	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time . ; So . OK , so that 's your training corpus , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_588	%	OK . ; and I said , " well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . " ; Yeah . ; Wow .
Bmr002_407	b	now how how do you how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ? ; Um There 's a little program that downloads into it . ; Um . ; Hmm .
Bed006_1437	b	This is this is a schema that defines XML messages that are passed from one module to another , ; Mm - hmm . ; mainly meaning from the natural language understanding , or from the deep language understanding to the action planner . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_255	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; But I mean you want you want it be restrictive but you also want it to to to have coverage . ; Right .
Bro018_40	b	And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum , ; Uh - huh . ; the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_653	cc	Right . ; I mean , it 's fine . ; You know , we have to it 's it 's iterative . ; We 're gonna have to work with it some .
Bmr007_238	b	Yeah , yeah , I h I have this that infor I have th that information now . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed017_762	aa	but uh or a temporarily putting it out of the sling ; Right . ; but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , ; Yeah .
Bmr009_327	%--	No prayer . ; That You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone . ; Yeah . ; Plus , I think it has more elegant e
Bmr003_897	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1751	no	That 's true . ; So I I think it 's just , ; OK . ; Oh , I don't know .
Bed014_821	ar	Yeah , but it he the decisions I made wer had to do with my thesis . ; Yeah . ; So consequently don't I get to decide then that it 's Robert 's job ? ; No .
Btr002_2488	b	I would too . ; Oh , right . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bns001_660	s	It is only um what the gateways get . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; And within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider ,
Bmr011_26	s	Hello . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK , agenda item one ,
Bmr002_1076	s	Exactly . ; They 're actually , they seem to be more ; the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles ; and things like that .
Bmr025_244	b	I hope he never listens to these meetings . ; That 's right . ; So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh uh , SoftSound guy , uh ; It 's amazing .
Bro023_701	s	So why did you choose , uh , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ? ; Uh , the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach . ; So , ; Stephane is working on spectral subtraction .
Bed014_364	ba	but I 'm about to write it up this evening . ; I solved that at the same time as " how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase " to get something like " I the kicked dog " . ; Um . ; That 's great .
Bro023_1667	b	Yeah , w ; Yeah , right now it 's a constant that just depending on the the noise spectrum . ; There 's ; Yeah .
Bmr010_684	b	I mean , I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway . ; Oh . That 's true . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1657	s	Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by part of the part of the script or something more ; Uh , yeah , ; it seems like ; it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these automatic speaker detection turn placing things .
Btr002_176	s	But I think these kinds of errors , it just shows the degree which it 's not strictly an acoustic task . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , the types of the types of confusions that happen , um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus .
Btr001_2610	s	And sometimes they don't . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I 've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do .
Bed017_484	s	But maybe you guys had that in the previous models . ; Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer , ; but he wants to point to the places w w ; Yeah , so . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert
Bmr018_781	%--	but you don't wanna , uh , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't . ; Right , exactly . ; so , so ; So that 's why I was wondering if it
Bed004_146	s	So , are are you trying to record this meeting ? ; There was a strange reflex . ; I have a headache . ; I 'm really sort of out of it .
Bmr029_614	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; I mean , I can certainly help with , uh , retraining the short male models , ; Right .
Bmr027_304	bk	So what does it say about the the the process of of , uh y the review process ? ; It doesn't have a time limit . ; That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts ; Oh , OK .
Bed017_439	s	Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results , ; and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach . ; So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? ; And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that ,
Bmr014_726	s	I mean , so it 's it 's ; I mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , ; you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I ; I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway .
Bmr013_702	aa	Yeah , yeah . ; That might save some time . ; If they 're horrible it won't help at all , ; Yeah , great .
Btr002_2766	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . I 've seen a few of them , ; Hmm . ; So yeah , you 've s they slip through .
Bro023_651	bk	Yeah . ; And then you multiply your noisy power spectrum with this . ; You get an estimate of the clean power spectrum . ; I see .
Bns001_624	s	Mm - hmm . ; They have a specific antenna for uh GSM Oh , GPS and and fu for future extended G - uh GSM networks and wireless LAN and and other thi and other network technology . ; In the roof of the car . They have a s lot of servers ; in the trunk of the car . Then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things
Bed010_690	bk	Mm - hmm . ; He 's he 's very interested in that . ; Here ; OK .
Bed017_402	s	Now , what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . ; But we can't really ; Um , so what I 'm what I try to do is um , to have um , ; uh So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem .
Bed003_1226	s	So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . ; Maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di ; if this ; and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse
Bed015_1037	%--	And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . ; So " Harry walked into the room " , ; " Harry " and " room " , ; you know , the room
Bmr019_1946	s	bu ; Mmm . ; so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings . ; The grouping .
Bed003_1169	s	But uh it 's basically ; we already talked about all this stuff , ; so . ; Um . The additional thing is I guess learning the probabilities , also .
Bns001_136	bk	Um . ; One short other topic is Uh . Claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime . ; Oh , ; OK .
Bmr008_1700	s	But It 's a problem to It 's a problem to identify and to detect , too , with eh the Javier system , for example . ; It is good , ; but it 's uh but it surprised me . ; Uh , Gives you a little more time to try to detect them .
Bro015_5	s	So . I uh uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news . ; Um Hynek is supposed to come for a couple days next week . ; Don't know which days yet . ; So hopefully he 'll have some intensive time to to work with people .
Bns002_571	s	Yeah , ; but , Miguel , this is a good point from from Dietmar , ; Yeah . ; but maybe here is a wall .
Bmr028_1614	s	I mean , I don't know if there 's a way to replace a battery , if it happens in the middle of a meeting . ; Well ; Maybe that 's hopeless anyway . ; Well , you can , but you 'll lose a lot of data .
Bmr018_1143	s	I did go through one of these meetings . ; I had , uh , one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the , uh , NSA meetings , ; and then I went through afterwards and double - checked it ; so that one is really very very accurate .
Bro017_184	s	We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , ; instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model . ; Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise . ; And I thought " well , that makes sense , " but so far we can't get much much out of it .
Bns003_82	s	Why you are laughing ? ; I ju ; I don't know , ; I cou I s I didn't see him ,
Bro012_1483	g	b but the thought I had was um looking at the language model that 's used in the HTK recognizer , ; which is basically just a big loop , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bro017_510	s	Hmm . ; So . ; And Harry said " Yeah . ; But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . "
Bed006_1208	s	it 's it 's called um uh s S P G - one ; Yeah . ; action ; a different action . Um and this uh action - two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do . And i in in a way similar to either Enter - View - Approach you may want to send a letter , read a letter , or dictate a letter , let 's say .
Bro022_754	%--	mm - hmm . ; Uh , yeah . ; OK . ; Uh , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,
Bed012_348	s	Like ; I guess they are evenly weighted . ; The different decision nodes , you mean ? ; Yeah , the Go - there , the Info - on , and the Location ?
Bmr016_2133	2	or , I don't know , ; We might wanna just a separate tag that says it 's read . ; like " read something " ; like " read "
Bmr008_373	s	That 's right . ; Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , If not given we will estimate .
Bed014_1396	b	it would still genera ; So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ? ; Like " conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this " might still give us quite a few possibilities ; Yeah .
Bed003_1029	%--	Just s l start up a new DOS . ; We - That 's alright . ; I can probably double cli click on it . ; Or
Bsr001_706	s	And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so we wanna see what we can do with it ; but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it .
Btr001_1741	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , ; or when it 's a laugh .
Btr001_277	no	Is that ; I it 's a good question . ; Um , ; And I can't really answer that .
Bdb001_352	b	Yeah . ; Th - this is exactly the kind of decision It 's just whatever ; But , I mean , people don't typically share this kind of stuff , right ? ; Right .
Bro007_334	b	alright ; so it looks to me I guess the same ; given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are are the ones to look at ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_659	s	um so ; We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . ; That 's you know if if there are more machines um uh here ; plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs
Bmr003_1300	%--	and this is a way which meshes well with with , uh , making it so that , uh , you know , on the At the ; Yeah . ; Boy , it 's such a nice interface . ; When you when you get the , um you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it , an indication of , uh ,
Bmr007_217	t3	here 's a relatively short meeting , ; it 's a forty forty plus minute meeting , ; and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but , uh I think there 's one one minute there where there where where there wasn't any overlap ? ; Hundred ninety - seven .
Btr002_2474	s	and then they do a ; I 'm not gonna do it ; cuz I don't really know how to do lipsmack . ; But but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture ,
Bed008_290	%--	more likely to view if he 's a tourist ; um ; and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um ; We did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this
Bed003_1612	s	Wait ; Quite possibly . ; Oh , oh , sorry . ; Wednesday .
Bmr012_920	s	Right . ; Sixteen is more common for for uh broadband stuff that isn't ; That isn't music . ; that isn't music and isn't telephone ,
Btr001_1738	aa	Mm - hmm . ; It Well , it 's communicative . ; Uh ; Yeah .
Btr001_908	s	Right . ; Mmm , oh right . ; Uh - huh . ; You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is .
Buw001_45	%	but I forgot to print any out . ; So . ; Besides with this big a group , ; it would take too much time .
Bmr011_339	aa	HCC . ; who 's interested in ar in array microphones . ; Oh , he 's doing array mikes . ; Yeah .
Bed003_505	s	OK . ; Uh - huh . ; I I gotcha . ; Yeah , similarly " closed " , I guess .
Bmr031_250	b	So . ; for this particular kind of application . ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bed013_1192	s	So in my c my case , this would sort of make this happy , and this would make the Go - there happy . ; What you 're saying is we have a Where - X question , Where - X node , that makes both happy . ; Right ? ; That 's what you 're proposing , which is , in my mind
Bro004_498	%--	OK , so if we take ; uh um ; let 's see ; PLP uh with on - line normalization and delta - del
Bmr011_1615	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and ; It 's pretty tough , uh , this group . Yeah .
Bmr025_1049	b	so we might n we might need to do that actually . ; OK . ; That sounds good . ; OK .
Bmr014_1002	s	It just means they have the right to have it . ; Well the in ; Alright . ; the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it ,
Bns003_55	no	Equipped with with we should equipped it with with Linux ; or maybe too with Free BSD , ; Well the first ; I doubt I don't know
Btr001_981	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that they should be able to handle themselves , ; and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now ,
Bmr024_79	b	That that was basically it . ; Not not much @ @ ; Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_204	s	Yeah . ; Yeah ; but But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever ; and that 's not anymore supported .
Bed015_1153	2	Um . ; S so again ; Then " predications " makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . ; Open to various things .
Btr002_336	b	You mean non - native na Non - native speakers ? ; I mean Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_796	no	Hmm . ; others on the um , mel energies . ; You can do both , ; but I cannot tell you what 's which one might be better
Bed016_358	aa	Um . ; Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , ; OK ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2203	ba	All ten hours ? ; Except for the missing thirty minutes . ; but ; Great .
Bmr003_2143	s	OK , ; s ; so that ; So it would c basically go on the diagonal here .
Bmr011_814	ba	you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately ; and and the focus on reliability . ; He expressed a lot of interest in reliability . ; It 's like he 's he 's really up on these things .
Bmr027_233	s	No . OK , well why don't you do that ; No , just ; and then make comments on what you want me to change ? ; No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything .
Btr002_749	b	So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully . ; I think that 's really important . ; Yeah , I think that 's really important ; Yeah .
Bed003_1454	%--	I think ; Is that possible ? ; One time I saw a report on trains , ; and I think there is a l
Bro027_360	s	But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually , ; but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . ; OK . ; But if if , uh if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in .
Bed004_702	s	but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . ; Based on ; we we have uh ; I was just made some examples from the ontology
Bmr031_980	%--	So if I did it , like , tomorrow that would be alright it sounds like ? ; for a while they were doing it after this meeting . ; Oh ! ; Yeah . Wednesdays , Fridays
Bed010_517	s	because you know people are likely to give descriptions ; like you know , " What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , " or something like that , ; you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff ; so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant .
Bmr021_487	s	Well , I think there was something else going on , ; because uh Dave Johnson said that DD was getting accessed frequently . ; Oh . Uh - huh . ; And it shouldn't be .
Bro016_729	%--	or Shou ; They should be less so . ; Yeah . ; But
Bmr022_1284	s	Well , it 's it 's just like source code , ; or ; right ? ; So that , when you 're developing it and it 's really rough , you don't put it in the repository .
Bed017_660	s	Hmm . ; Well , if you fal solve the problem , hope you can do one for us too . ; Alright , was there anything else for this ? ; One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal .
Bmr013_253	b	Yeah , sure . ; Sure . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr029_876	b	because when I heard how little speech there was for some of them , I thought they can only hurt your models , ; because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map , ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed006_1395	%--	No , this is the useful , ; So . ; you know , don don't worry . ; and um and and I th I hope
Bro014_580	s	Well , let 's say for ins ; see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch . ; So just just for example . ; So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there
Bro028_131	b	Um . ; So it 's some kind of hierarchical thing , uh , that Sunil also tried , um , on SPINE ; and apparently it helps a little bit also . ; Mmm .
Btr001_1090	s	I don't think I ever have . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean I can only think of like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while .
Bed016_432	ba	this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Kind of a different level of analysis .
Bed006_224	qh	How however I suggest that if you if you look at your email carefully you may think you may find that you already have it . ; Oops . ; Already ? ; Really ?
Bro012_30	s	Right . ; But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him ; and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , uh , many other problems could ha happen . ; And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that ,
Bro022_291	b	I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio . ; Well , well ; So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1763	s	So , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? ; Well , uh , ; That 's what ; Well , I guess that 's the same .
Bmr015_1122	%--	and and and ; marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods . ; Basically the more we can mark the better . ; But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area ,
Bmr009_528	%--	Yeah . ; Oh , that 's not what I meant . ; No , no . ; I I I I
Bed009_383	%--	It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's ; So , I mean there is this this this nice interf ; uh , No , ; it 's it 's also a quantrant uh uh
Bmr013_769	%--	Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , ; Um , no . ; No ? ; We could ,
Bmr028_1168	s	which , uh , which I wr which I wrote about in the last status report , ; which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on Hub - five . ; So , um . We haven't tried that yet on the meetings , ; uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too .
Bmr024_143	s	And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely . ; Yeah , one interesting note is uh , or problem ; I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , uh , SND - play and then the file , ; every once in a while , @ @ uh , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps .
Bns002_598	b	and they uh have the same uh uh sensitivity . ; Mm - hmm . ; So they can hear ; OK .
Bro026_682	b	So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? ; Yeah . ; I see . ; OK .
Bro012_283	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data ; and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system .
Bro003_435	s	So , ; without without any licensing big deals , or anything like that . ; And , um , so we 've been talking about this this , uh , cube thing , ; and it 's beginning more and more looking like the , uh , the Borge cube thing .
Bmr027_1446	ar	But we sort of failed . ; Right ? ; Hhh . ; No .
Bmr005_248	%--	it 's interesting . ; I I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention . ; I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , ; but they did say
Bmr021_355	b	and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that that just saved my butt ; OK .
Bro005_1111	%--	OK . ; And um . ; Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , ; I don't know if we want to
Bed011_485	%--	He was vicious . ; OK , we gotta we gotta disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time , sort of ; I mean there they are significantly different , but . ; But no , they 're I mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know
Bed006_1027	b	I 'm sure there 's a commercial event schema in there somewhere . ; Oop . ; I d f ; Yeah ,
Bed011_334	s	you know one of these ; l y y y you gave me those dozens of files ; and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences , found fifteen , twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on ; and like , " alright , well , let 's start here . "
Bmr007_529	t3	or ; Cuz my impression is sometimes it happens when there 's a pause , ; Yes . ; There you go .
Bmr022_913	aa	Oh they they have little headsets ? ; Yep . ; Th - d ; Yes .
Bmr012_753	s	Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms . ; RSMP . ; Yeah , I don't really . ; Missing all the vowels .
Bed016_458	s	Right . ; Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . ; See ; you th you th you then fill it with researchers .
Bsr001_1408	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , which i ; And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate . ; Well , just just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem .
Bed013_1296	%--	and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment . ; Um , but ; OK . ; Um , it seems like for instance , " where is X " , the fact that it might mean um , " tell me how to get to X " ,
Bed002_88	bk	So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . ; So the ; Since it it does isn't attributed . ; Oh , I see ,
Bmr002_1318	aap	So so , I mean , the part that I 'm doing , I 'm really happy to supply that without any ; cuz it it 's just it 's there . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all .
Bed014_1374	s	which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about . ; Right . ; In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings . ; Which uh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the when I 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me you know , we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work .
Bro027_218	s	Yep . ; I mean , that that was sort of one ; I mean , ; the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set .
Bed002_743	b	I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting th the data ; of , like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city . as like one situation . ; And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_832	b	I ju you guys are ; Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . I 'll ; But , uh Huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1936	aa	Mm - hmm . ; This is this is called being a linguist . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1370	%--	Mental space we need . ; Mm - hmm . ; The context we need . ; Um , so anyway , Keith
Bns002_287	%--	Yeah , in fact ; One is really really ; This one . ; This one , n next slide is
Bed017_627	s	Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh , in two weeks . ; Right , ; and ; Yeah , for for some reason he 's not doing that .
Bed011_815	s	And they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be . ; And I looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it 's not a ; And I wrote in there " En - Enough " people have to be there . ; And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people .
Bmr003_2216	bk	Yeah . ; that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and and and you 're live . ; Oh , then it comes on . ; I see , I see .
Bed015_180	s	And so I was like , " OK , well both of you don't like it ? ; Fine , we can change it " . ; It 's g it 's gone . ; But I I I 'm starting to like it again .
Bro007_222	s	I mean not not by a huge amount , ; I don't know . ; What are what are the sizes of any of these sets , ; I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten .
Btr002_1579	%	and yet , i i it 's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone 's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns , I bet you , we would all agree on who it who it was . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know .
Bro012_820	s	So it ; y Yeah . ; You you get an estimate of the standard deviation . ; No , I understand that ,
Bmr023_559	b	that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . ; Well . ; That 's what Adam wanted . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2051	ar	Um , so we 're actually ; So the bit we 're a bit deficient in as we ; So I I think probably the biggest thing would ; Well , no
Bro025_559	s	It 's , like , ev even even if I use a channel zero VAD , I 'm just averaging the the s power spectrum . ; But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum . ; So he 's , like he tries to capture only the stationary part in it . ; So the averaging is , like , different from updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments .
Bed013_58	bk	And that 's what I 'm gonna lay on you now . ; And um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva ; because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough . ; OK .
Bmr021_544	%--	OK , now and you 're just you 're not talking about the s the X disks the X uh partitions , ; So . ; just the backed up space , ; or ?
Bed013_95	s	It 's it 's it 's not possible . ; Right , right . ; But maybe one could do some learning . ; If you get the system to speak to itself , you may find n break downs and errors and you may be able to learn .
Bmr006_1638	s	Yu - Ching ? ; y Yu - Ching . ; was that um , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . ; But , you know , h they won't know these people ,
Bed010_664	%--	You you can actually say things like , um , " it 's behind the tree from me " or something like that , I think , in in in certain circumstances in English , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; As sort of " from where I 'm standing it would appear that "
Bro021_269	s	or ; Uh , I mean , first place it 's fifteen DB , uh , down across the utterance . ; And maybe you 'd want to have something that was a little more adaptive . ; Secondly , you happened to pick fifteen DB
Bro024_1824	b	Maybe for this weekend I will have result TI - digits ; and I can complete that s like this . ; Well . ; Uh .
Bmr002_929	ba	right ? ; So we 're not we 're not concerned about getting getting about buying and or bringing in tools . ; Right . ; We 're very good at time alignments .
Bmr001_587	g	Yeah . ; And And there 's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be ; It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine , ; right ?
Bmr007_1120	b	I mean , it sounds weird but but you know it 's it 's cheap and , uh Be interesting to have the camera going . ; Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes , ; But . ; OK .
Bro028_41	b	Um . ; And what are we sitting at currently ? ; So , currently d uh , we have system that has two hundred and thirty . ; Yeah .
Bed009_427	b	Right ? ; Clearly . ; So this i this is where I think this ; Yes .
Bmr024_511	%--	um , ; Yeah . ; do those actually go down or not ? ; Because of
Buw001_2149	s	It sounds like such a t ; and especially good ; Yeah , OK . ; Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural .
Btr002_3375	bk	Yes . ; and no ; You can either if you mark it " mike noise " then I 'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put VOC or NVC on the in the substitution file . ; Yeah , right .
Bed003_1167	s	" Future Work " . ; I think every presentation have a should have a " Future Work " slide . ; But uh it 's basically ; we already talked about all this stuff ,
Bro010_1115	bk	Hmm . ; Yeah , ; I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . ; Yeah ,
Bed015_914	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; " John is on the bus " versus " John is on the train . " ; Right .
Bmr025_845	s	Yep . ; and ; and so forth ; so and and Jane is more into it
Bro016_1178	bk	And , uh , ; we might as well do our digits . ; And like I say , I I encourage you to go ahead and meet , uh , next week with , uh , uh , Hynek . ; Alright ,
Buw001_1571	s	Yeah . ; Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ ; Well , we 're piloting . ; We 'll just do it and see what happens .
Btr001_1062	b	yeah . ; I agree . ; And and when I when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin , I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_448	ba	but maybe yeah , maybe you 're ; If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like ; right . Right . Right . ; Oh , that 's a good idea .
Bro016_205	%--	I 've seen that with the mel cepstrum . ; Yeah . ; I don't I don't know about the Aurora front - end , ; but
Bmr028_737	bk	They 're stored on Popcorn . ; This is on Popcorn ? Or ? ; Well , no . I mea I mean , the fir ; Oh , jus OK .
Bed003_854	s	we have an object type statue . ; That really is an object type . ; Right . ; So there is there 's gonna be a bunch of statues .
Bed003_1388	s	and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . ; So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , ; Hmm . ; the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen
Btr002_128	%--	Hmm . ; Oh . ; That 's very subtle . ; A
Bro007_553	s	Oh , that was good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features
Bro026_510	b	Or a simple neural net , ; right ? ; I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2671	b	which is what I remember you telling me to do that . ; Oh , well , yeah , that 's that 's a different thing . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1011	%--	But I told them if if there 's an obvious speech error , uh , like I said in one thing , ; Yes . ; and I gave my my example , like I said , " microfon " in instead of " microphone " . ; Didn't bother
Bro014_973	s	Mm - hmm . ; And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , obviously you have something about the excitation ,
Bro017_931	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; Yeah , so y ; but I mean , but it 's it 's i it 's do - able ,
Bmr022_1476	s	and then you have to merge them . ; And the b the thing that makes it ea OK to do that , is knowing where the synch time boundaries are . ; Cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you 've only got twenty words or so in an utterance . ; It 's when you get the whole meeting
Bns001_735	s	So , there is a lot of hardware to develop , but not ; You know , radio frequency technology , ; wide - band w uh CDMA . ; These kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched .
Bed002_812	s	Some find @ @ Forget that for now . ; And then , a human operator comes on , and and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , ; but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? ; now with a human operator .
Bmr009_490	s	Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different . ; Yeah . ; Right . Right . ; You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could if you had a good model for it .
Bed009_765	s	OK . ; what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer ; Mm - hmm . ; so it 's speed is crucial .
Bmr025_897	ba	and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech ; maybe somebody will be interested in this ; and ; I like this PDA idea .
Bmr007_586	aa	But they all want to be next . ; I have a feeling most of these things are that that are not a benevolent kind are are are , uh um are are competitive as opposed to real really really hostile . ; Right . ; Yeah , I agree .
Bro026_356	b	Yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close . ; That 's very close . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed003_105	g	but I decided to put it on the same line for space . ; " Nice walls " which we can look up ; because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode , ; right ,
Bed004_862	s	Oh yeah , ; b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever , ; so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem , ; that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately .
Bed013_800	%--	You may may ruin your career forever , if you appear . ; Yeah , you might get blacklisted . ; And um , ; the uh , other thing ,
Bro021_873	bk	and this is this . ; No , no . ; The top Y is what ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_361	s	uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement ; so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters . ; So ; that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system .
Bed005_122	bk	So . ; It , uh I didn't measure it , ; but it was about an hour and ten minutes . ; Yep .
Bro012_784	s	So . ; the energy . ; This is a plot of C - zero , uh when we don't use spectral substraction , ; and when there is no on - line normalization .
Bro013_189	b	Four - Fourier . ; So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_399	qw	Five . ; And what were you just describing ? ; Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the , uh , Wiener filter plugged into it . ; But where 's the , uh , on - line normalization and so on ?
Bro022_73	%--	Uh - huh . ; So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper ; and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time ; and ?
Bro014_1134	b	And the way to do this is that ; well , we have the we have the FFT because it 's computed in in the in the system , ; and we have the mel filter banks , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1532	s	NSA core group activity , ; and this theoretical framework , whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter , in principle , ; because the road map for the the next generation networks is is eh is for many years . ; And b before UMTS will be deployed very well , I believe eh it will be common t uh two thousand four or something like that .
Bed002_736	s	N no , no not ; i it was mobile ; but not not with a w a real wizard system . ; So there were never answers .
Bmr013_339	s	I mean this is the kind of reason why ; I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , " can't be done " . ; Right . ; He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones ,
Bns003_127	aa	and , uh for web access , the fire wall is open . ; That 's all . ; And But currently it 's not working , right ? ; Right ,
Bed016_159	bk	Yeah . ; That was the most recent one ? ; Uh , yeah , I think so . ; OK .
Bed014_980	bk	Well , we 're meeting Tuesday . ; I mean we usually meet Tuesday or l like , linguists um , at two . ; Would it ; That 's right .
Bmr028_1569	s	But but it And it 's pejorative with respect to a certain purpose . ; It 's pejorative towards ; I understand . ; It 's pejorative to o ourselves .
Bro012_705	bk	yeah . ; I thought " hey , you know th " I ; My initial thought was " this is not too bad ! " ; Right .
Bed003_1297	s	Yeah . ; Or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . ; Like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , ; which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door .
Bsr001_1198	aa	But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype collection devices or standards , then we could share data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1817	b	But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? ; Right . ; Right , so , uh , this this raises the question of what are our current purposes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_209	qw	I mean , uh , d these were not the ones we we actually did it . ; Um . ; What 's an idiomatic of phrasing this ? ; Which films are showing ?
Bro003_1242	aa	Used to be . ; It 's it 's still a little faster on the ; Is it ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr021_738	%--	And I do not know what the um ICSI um front - end would do . ; I mean , what the bandwidth is . ; Um , ; but the results are such that
Buw001_278	b	but it doesn't really ; How do you generate queries from that ? ; Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2086	s	Hmm . ; i It 's just when you have these points and you 're trying to figure out where the decimal places are ; And we could always add it later . ; Percent 's easy to detect .
Bed015_652	bk	Yeah . ; I thought that that would be something like ; there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing ; Right , OK .
Bmr028_74	b	Right . ; And , so you s it shows that instead of the wavefile . ; And so that that 's working , ; Cool .
Btr001_650	ba	I don't know if that 's actually true ; but I 'm just throwing that out there . ; Hmm . ; It 's interesting .
Bro014_1573	s	Sure . ; I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman . ; Yeah . ; And and , uh , the the MSG features were sort of built up with this notion
Bmr019_1120	ba	Ah , right ! ; It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics . ; and an because cuz it 's another question about how many pauses they put in between them . ; Horrible .
Bed003_1159	bk	I have a habit of doing that , ; but . ; OK , wonderful . ; OK .
Bro023_575	%--	Yeah , ; Um , ; which is ; which is ,
Bed016_983	qw	and you can refer back to it , ; No no , I I 'm agreeing that this is a good , um ; and so you can Castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , ; so you can say " Where is the castle ,
Bmr028_1158	s	You get out Switchboard . ; That 's just the lang the language model . ; Yeah . That 's right . ; So that 's how it was generated .
Bro024_410	s	just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses . ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all .
Bed015_51	s	Um , maybe I will ; let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , ; um , because that 's , ; I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people .
Bmr028_1047	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . That 's an interesting ; because I think it would be a pretty big difference . ; When you listen , you can sort of tell where people are ,
Bmr006_699	aa	but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . ; Yes , absolutely .
Bed011_656	aa	right ? ; But what about uh ; Mm - hmm ; Yep .
Bsr001_1000	aa	Yeah , in many cultures it 's not bad manners to to speak on top of another one . ; Yeah , I was thinking , if Transcriber were invented in Italy or something , it would have been handling multiple ; Sure . ; Absolutely .
Bmr008_836	qy	or uh , what you were saying , " Languages in the home " . ; But I think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful ; instead of " Region now " , say . It 's a little bit unbounded . ; um so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there .
Bdb001_840	bh	which allows you to do all kinds of good search things in there . ; The , uh ; One of the things that ATLAS is doing is they 're trying to define an API which is independent of the back store , ; Huh .
Bed016_865	s	OK . But more emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ? ; computer ; it 's ; More there 's going to be the just four computational linguists , by coincidence ,
Bsr001_854	%--	This is a NIST evaluation . ; Um . ; Of the speaker ID or something ? ; This i
Bmr007_1061	b	you know , what I mean , ; Yeah . ; there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_435	aa	Well , ; I 'm I 'm open to ; the d the well , the uh The part that 's not wonderful is someone has to write the software . ; Right .
Btr002_2351	ba	but you wouldn't think that you would write them down . ; Yeah , the one I kn I kn get all the time is " tsk " ; Yeah . ; Oh yes ! Good example .
Bmr007_1166	s	Yeah , yeah , ; Technical stuff . ; " range of things " , yeah . ; Um and and you know , I sort of threw in what you did with what Jane did on in under the , uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps .
Bmr006_965	b	but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_939	s	because then , you know , they 're they they have a it it 's in a category , ; it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking , ; and it 's all in one chu ; But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available .
Bsr001_1882	b	Right . ; Yeah , so we have some ideas there but not enough data to train . ; So al ; Right .
Bed003_58	co	Ach u ; I 'd prefer not to . ; OK . ; Continue .
Bed002_1347	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully . ; Talk features . ; Yep .
Bmr007_48	bk	but I think I 'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it 's inaccurate or uh insufficient . ; A list that you have to send off to who ? ; Uh , to uh uh , IBM . ; Oh .
Bmr014_363	s	So ; I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits . ; Yeah . ; So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours ,
Bns001_1721	b	Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first ; Yeah . ; ATM stuff . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_250	s	OK . ; and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling . ; Oh , that 's right . ; I I did look that up .
Bed015_109	s	Mm - hmm . ; And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about ,
Bns002_71	cc	Thank you . ; Well , eh , I I have prepared , eh , a really short talk about some of the topics ; I I have been doing some w some research work uh before coming here . ; And eh , well , mainly I will present
Bdb001_552	s	it could span time boundaries of any type , ; Right . ; it could be instantaneous , ; things like that .
Bro026_147	s	Uh , um , and , um , ; That 's that 's nice . ; and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . ; So keep a certain set of things constant .
Bro027_727	bk	The best was fifty - four point five . ; Yeah . ; Point s ; Oh .
Bmr008_1217	b	You have you have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your how you 're perceived and how y and how the other @ @ ; Hmm . ; Role , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro023_353	%--	a w I mean , ; the t the the baseline that you are talking about is the MFCC baseline , right ? ; The t yeah , ; Or ?
Bmr023_1012	%--	I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements . ; Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . ; Mm - hmm . ; If it 's , you know , like way way worse then , you know
Bed013_43	bk	Oh . Well then the you know , it 's not a big deal . ; Once you get to the United States it 'll be a problem , ; but ; Yeah .
Bmr019_626	s	but that 's exactly what he he 's gonna ; H h ; He 's he 's sort of back , ; but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today .
Bro025_411	b	So the frame - dropping is the last thing that we do . ; So , yeah , what we do is we compute the silence probability , ; convert it to that binary flag , ; Uh - huh .
Bed014_1449	s	It 's so amazing . ; Well , y you know of it ? ; I i i it 's one of your hobbies ? ; It 's great exercise , I must say .
Bmr016_1966	s	" Point five . " ; Good . ; And then , in here , " NUMS " , ; so it 's not going to be mistaken as a gloss .
Bns001_1466	s	W ; that would be great , ; but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial . ; But I think that 's pfff ! that 's years , you know .
Bmr008_672	no	But but ; but we could have you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American , ; We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization . ; I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever ,
Bro013_412	b	and uh it 's running . ; So , let 's see what will happen . ; Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1190	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK , I also wrote a script which will , um , retrieve anything in curly brackets , or anything which I 've classified as an acronym , ; and a pronounced acronym . ; And the way I tag ac pronounced acronyms is that I have underscores between the components .
Bsr001_503	aa	Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable . ; I ; We could ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_397	%--	Over over the entire c over the entire channel . ; Or windowed ? ; Don't train ; Over the
Bro022_22	bk	And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed014_585	b	and you 're able to to conclude on it . ; Yeah . ; priming a spreading activation ; Right .
Bmr021_477	s	So . ; Well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it w with a with a meta disk allocation , you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on XE were on the same ; sorry , ; different partitions of the same physical disk .
Bed005_864	%	Mm - hmm . ; OK , and the one for next uh , summer is just half done ; and then the other half is this , um , " generation thing " which we think isn't much different . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_325	s	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit . ; And then others were connected digits . ; Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think .
Bro003_448	aa	Um , and seeing if if it hurts or helps . ; And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ? ; Anyway . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro024_1669	s	No , in this case it 's just the gain . ; Uh - huh . ; And ; But the way it 's done is that um , for low gain , there is this non nonlinear smoothing actually .
Bro021_291	bk	Or if it 's below s ; I systematically add the noise , ; but the , um , noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak . ; Oh , oh . I see .
Bro019_476	bk	So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to beat that actually . ; Wow . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr001_474	aa	Yeah , it 's pretty horrible . ; So what would we do for training ? ; So if we 're if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ? ; Yeah .
Bro028_482	s	Yeah . ; That 's that 's I mean , one one percent is sort of what I would I would figure . ; If somebody was paying really close attention , you might get ; I would actually think that if , you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent error on digits .
Bmr028_376	ba	so that you know you don't have to go through the whole meeting , ; and Um , ; and I didn't hear back . ; So I thought " OK . It 's probably too hard .
Bed008_113	qw	And here I was really uh in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid ; because um this case it 's pretty simple , ; but as we will see the other ones um ; for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ?
Bmr020_1689	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah that would be very good . ; Yeah . ; And then we can you know
Bmr006_405	b	Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah
Bmr026_644	b	Yeah ; so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . ; OK . ; Alright .
Bdb001_949	s	Yeah , definitely . ; I think the more eyes look at this the better . ; Especially if there 's , e um you know , if someone can help with at least the the setup of the right ; Oh , hi .
Bmr006_328	b	Tape recorder . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_638	aa	So . ; doesn't need to reflect everything , ; yeah . ; Right .
Bmr016_1809	b	and since we know who that is , you know , we could correct it , ; You can correct it . ; but ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2291	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bed009_1082	d	Yep , yep . ; And how do you envision um the the um this deep semantic to be worked with . ; Would it be highly ambiguous if ; and then there would be another module that takes that um highly underspecified deep semantic construction
Bro011_407	s	Well he was the guy the guy that was using ; you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? ; Mark Randolph . ; Yeah he 's he 's he 's at Motorola now .
Bed003_770	%--	We were th ; But uh I don't know y what the right thing is to do for that . ; I 'm not I don't know if I totally am happy with the way it is . ; Why don't we
Buw001_2060	b	so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . ; Yeah . ; So there 's lots of recordings that ; Yeah .
Bro027_914	s	we have to find a way to decrease the number of features . ; Um ; So , it seems funny that I don't know , maybe I don't u quite understand everything , but that adding features ; I guess I guess if you 're keeping the back - end fixed .
Bmr007_434	b	just never mind comparison with something else , ; Mm - hmm . ; what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them . ; Yeah .
Bro005_494	qo	d Was that experiment done ? ; No , not yet . ; Yeah , OK . ; Uh , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ?
Bro014_159	b	But it 'll it really increases what we can run on . ; Hmm . Cool . ; So , together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1938	g	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's there 's some , uh , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ?
Bmr006_1399	s	Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Hundred . ; And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody .
Btr001_733	b	Hmm . ; Shrink in them or whatever , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah .
Bed014_1427	ba	Why don't ; No , that 's not really true , ; but like ; Bummer .
Bro028_1161	s	Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , uh , the big picture is k um , come up with a set of , uh , intermediate categories , ; then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition ,
Bmr024_1528	b	So . ; Yeah . ; At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , uh , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has has some noisy noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data . ; Yeah .
Bro005_673	s	and perhaps this is what makes the difference . ; Um . ; Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . ; So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things .
Bmr002_778	s	And I 'll try to get one for you , too . ; Oh , you 've got one . ; What are you looking at here ? ; He 's got the Mark - up Framework .
Bro003_1132	%--	It 's not too much , ; no . ; Yeah . ; So it 's
Bmr006_1237	s	I mean , I know I n I know that 's a very important cue . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA ,
Bed005_931	bk	OK . ; And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing , ; necessary , but but not ; Right .
Bdb001_1198	2	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and uh , sort of like th uh , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , uh , diff . ; Diff .
Bro021_582	s	Oh . ; I don't know how much you 'd be training on . ; OK . ; The full ?
Bmr021_15	s	Oh . ; Who does ? ; I do . ; I do .
Bro028_187	s	and then just using the the other silence probability helps . ; Mmm . ; Um ; Yeah . The next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data .
Bed008_885	b	Yep . ; But that now that kind of ; um what 's the word ; Hmm .
Bmr007_682	b	Well , we 're not really set up for it to do that . ; But . ; Or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove , uh visual contact . ; Yeah .
Bed012_413	co	We ; Is that your point ? ; Well , no . I I guess my question is , Is the reason that we can make a node f ; or OK . So , lemme see if I 'm confused .
Bro011_767	b	Yeah . ; Great ! ; OK , guess we 're done . ; OK .
Bro018_1137	co	I think it 's a much wider range of channels ; and it ; No , ; but wait a minute .
Bro023_216	bk	Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah , ; Ah . ; that 's If somebody 's using a system to ask for directions or something , ; OK .
Bro014_204	b	And so , it may be that that 's what 's happening here . ; I I I have to look it up and see . ; I I don't exactly remember . ; OK .
Bed010_513	s	Oh right . ; and that was pretty interesting ; and you know , I mean , ; seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh to what we 're doing here
Bmr031_823	b	It combines categories . ; So when we say " transcribed " , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM , ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1053	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I mean we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation ; because people move around , ; and uh , if if it 's if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's it 's you can't really do inversion ,
Btr002_2002	s	When you 're somewhere else ? ; No , no . While I while I 'm working here , ; No , no . OK . ; it 's like nine o '
Btr001_2425	%--	For obvious reasons , probably , ; if that 's the way he uses it . ; That 's true , ; that would The
Bns001_1769	s	not that I 'm doing everything ; I could not I f didn't have the time in the past ; and I will not have it in the future ; and maybe I will stay here only s four weeks or five weeks .
Bdb001_953	%--	Hi , Jane . ; Mmm . ; the right representation , ; then , i you know , I hope it won't
Bro005_973	b	I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's ; e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . ; Yeah . ; f But , yeah .
Bro010_1195	h	And then there are s uh , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for , uh for this kind of de - reverberation . ; Do y do you know any references to any ? ; Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . ; Uh ,
Bed003_683	%--	No , ; I think we should have uh exponentially more middle nodes than features we 've extracted . ; OK . ; I 'm ju I 'm just jo
Bro011_499	x	Is it sonorant in that band ? ; Is it sonorant in that band ? ; Right . ; i It 's hard to even answer that
Bmr024_1343	s	in each case how do you determine , you know , the the usual fudge factors ? ; The , uh the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling , ; uh , uh ; Um I uh I 'm actually re - optimizing them .
Bed014_607	%--	Fair enough , OK , ; but , but , in terms of the c c the current implementation ; right ? ; so that
Bro028_560	aa	you know , ; sixty - thousand ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bro014_726	%--	OK . ; Um . ; Mm - hmm . ; But it has the , uh
Bro024_1683	bk	Mm - hmm . ; And , best is to smooth this somehow . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , yeah ,
Bmr013_157	s	But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , ; H How ; Right . ; so it 's gonna be different .
Bro012_359	s	Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . ; It 's not a mean of word error rate . ; It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , ; it 's a weighted mean of improvements .
Bsr001_542	s	Mmm . ; And , yeah , ; Oh . ; I absolutely
Bed008_40	%--	Great . ; OK so let 's start with the uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff ; and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . ; Well I think one could go there 's
Bed009_973	aa	Interesting . ; Not easy . ; Well there 's m I 'm sure there 's gonna be more discussion on that after your talk . ; Mm - hmm ,
Bro027_1395	no	rather than doing a r ; Ah . OK . ; So what i what about , um i u what i w ; I mean , I don't know if this is a good idea or not ,
Bmr016_790	b	No , I didn't notice that actually . ; um , that 's why those comments are s are in there . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Btr002_3420	ba	Do it separately , then . OK . ; Sure did . ; Yes . ; Good deal .
Bro016_322	b	Right . ; And as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front - end also then becomes a priority for this particular test , ; and saying you don't have to do that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1357	s	And uh ; Oh , right . ; And then , the the dropping North , ; so it would be Western .
Bro012_1384	s	Well , for Italian perhaps we have , ; but we don't have this labeling for Aurora . ; We just have a labeling with word models ; but not for phonemes .
Bmr005_521	s	Because I I found a difference . ; Yeah , well , just I mean , just in that that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago , ; there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time ; and and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could .
Bmr020_1271	b	So she does the adjustments on those guys ? ; But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins . ; On that meeting . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_444	%--	OK . ; Yeah . ; Oh , sorry . ; And maybe everybody should uh give a short
Bdb001_1191	aa	So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations . ; Yep . ; I I don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that . ; No .
Bmr031_1201	s	but most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one . ; And so I 'm just in in progress of , yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data ; and to see how much worse that is . ; So that that I have three things .
Bro023_991	bk	But it was just a thought that that it might be something to try . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bmr011_1186	s	but there was ; And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , uh , Dave finishes the ; and maybe it 's already finished ; the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .
Bed017_119	%--	I think so . ; In what order shall we proceed ? ; OK . ; Maybe you have your on - line
Bed015_1625	b	Mm - hmm . ; So we would have it be in quotes in English . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed008_704	aa	and the other is it it gets used ; S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? ; Subgrouping , basically ; Yeah .
Bmr016_841	s	N ; Eighteen . ; Eigh - eighteen . ; It was a spare that Dave had around
Bmr003_2172	b	Alright . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bdb001_1221	ba	Is ; Exactly . ; But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the the speaker ons and offs . ; And that 's very difficult .
Bsr001_2210	b	Hmm . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_726	bk	So we can just map ; map them to ; No problem . ; Great .
Buw001_1609	s	And you 're s ; Right . We ; Hmm ? ; we need to look at our web page
Bmr030_248	s	Ah , great . ; So you see , like , the F - zero contour ? ; Yeah , so you see the pitch contours ; and you and when you hit play , like there 's a line that goes through it ,
Bed008_1172	b	well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place ; what rule of combination is used there . ; So th yes they so these things all affect it , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro027_993	%--	Well ; Yeah . ; and it didn't really ; And , uh , th
Bmr018_1272	h	A little , ; Hang a five pound weight off the off the back . ; We did that ; um ,
Bmr001_240	aa	Oh , I see . ; If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work . ; It 's Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker . ; I guess .
Bmr010_792	s	I it makes their their job extremely easy . ; Uh . ; Yeah . ; And then there 's mass .
Btr001_511	s	and you can't really tell ; Uh - huh . ; and ; Or they 're laughing when they 're talking
Bro003_1391	%--	Oh , I see . ; that the format for the em the program to train the neural network . ; I necessary to convert . ; And someti
Bmr011_164	bk	uh , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . ; Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working . ; The little the boxes under the table . ; Yeah .
Bro024_416	b	OK . ; OK . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr009_352	br	To study individual ? ; Hmm ? ; Sorry , ; what ?
Bmr009_1580	bk	and it 's likely that uh ; So . And and they responded favorably ; looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version . ; Oh .
Bmr022_535	b	u ; I mean , it 's not a bad idea to try the alignment . ; Um , if there 's only like three of them , then if you align , the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1085	aa	So . ; Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech , ; a redo of the HLT paper . ; Right .
Bmr028_516	bk	So th I 'm sure that we have , uh , fresh , you know , information on them . ; Right . ; Yeah . None of the e emails bounced , so I know they 're going somewhere . ; Good . OK .
Bed008_399	qy	given that he knows it , of course . ; Alright . ; So let me suggest this . ; Uh w could you move those up about halfway .
Bed010_417	s	Or should I collect it all ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; Doesn't matter .
Bro024_721	aa	So we had forty - four percent in the first proposal . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1374	b	Yeah . Cuz it just I mean , it just subtracts it out . ; In fact in fact you can run it in sort of enhancement mode where you get speech out ; and and and , uh , then just run it through the rest of your recognizer . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_405	b	So that 's fixed in this . ; Yeah , we talked about that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Uh - huh .
Bed010_910	aa	It 's OK to be purist within that context . ; Within that , ; Yes , ; yeah ,
Bro013_709	cc	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , and um , another f first step is ; um , ; so the the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response
Bmr023_1000	s	Right ? ; Cuz we need to do the exact experiment . ; Right . ; I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative .
Bed008_479	b	Um what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? ; Um things . ; So places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_259	s	Some ; Right , as though it 's leading into something else . ; It 's like kind of like introducing ; Yeah , the first one is like , the " so " is connected to the sentence ,
Bro026_779	aa	OK . ; So sh shall we , like , add Chuck also to the mailing lists ? ; It may be better , I mean , in that case if he 's going to ; Yeah .
Btr002_1984	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It really is strange . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2603	%--	because it 's it 's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface . ; I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it , ; Yeah , they do write the numbers in . ; The
Bro023_1031	b	right ? ; Yeah , the one you showed yesterday . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr015_637	s	and one of them is that , ; um , um , ; once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber . ; As you might expect ,
Bmr006_284	s	Um . ; So . ; Yeah . ; another type of meeting .
Bed003_1068	s	It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's how actual probability tables are specified .
Bed002_704	s	I 'm sure that , you know ; Yeah . ; The No , that 's fine . ; I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject .
Bro017_1174	%--	We can set up a webcam maybe . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; What you know , nowadays ,
Bro019_546	g	yeah , I 'm not being I 'm not being clear . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ?
Bed006_57	bk	ha - ha . ; " One of us . " ; but um it 's too late for him now . ; Yeah right .
Bns001_1174	qw	That is a ; But the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too big ; to put all these big pieces to ; What do you mean by " put together " ?
Bmr026_1075	b	Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got ; Uh well . It depended on the task . ; I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important ; Right .
Bdb001_961	aa	Um , ; so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what , ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bro018_559	s	What ; Um . So , support vector machines are are good with dealing with a less amount of data ; Hmm . ; and um so if you if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job in learning the the patterns .
Bmr020_523	%--	But so , we sort of just based on the lexical um , identity of the words , we we tagged them as one of these things . ; And of course the d the interruption points we got from the original transcripts . ; So , ; and then we looked at the disti
Bns002_944	b	Yeah . ; that are uh shared about w w among the community . ; Yeah , I g got it . ; Yeah .
Bns002_900	s	But , it is a problem because you are using more area than you should . ; And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place at the same time . ; And therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power ; it is also connected to the net to the global network throughput .
Bro023_542	s	Yeah , ; so actually I received a a new document , describing this . ; Yeah , that 's ; And what they did finally is to , mmm , uh , not to align the utterances but to perform recognition ,
Bmr023_363	ba	I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever . ; But but , um for all sorts of reasons ; but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time , then it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . ; Good .
Bro016_121	cc	I would need to do that . ; OK . ; So ; I can do that for next week .
Bmr019_1379	s	I mean , it it 's it 's actually the Aurora task . ; Maybe they 'll get s ; Aurora 's very specific . ; Well , maybe it won't be after this deadline extension .
Bed011_591	b	I w we will we will not ask you more . ; ri ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr020_907	s	So tomorrow , when we go to make the um uh , chunked file for IBM , we 're going to actually compare the two . ; So he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting , ; Great idea ! ; and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .
Bro005_979	b	and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . ; So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed006_721	s	Mm - hmm . ; And the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type " going into " , goes of type " want to go to a place where I can take a picture of " , et cetera . ; So this is sort of what it looks like ; now , some simple " Go " action from it from an object named " Peter 's Kirche " of the type " Church " to an object named " Powder - Tower " of the type " Tower " .
Bro018_998	b	Hmm . ; Um , and that 's that 's why when people started getting databases that had a little more noise in it , like like uh um Broadcast News and so on , ; that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_96	s	or I 'd have to add a little stem for the " am " , when I build the built the tree . ; OK . ; OK . ; Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on ,
Bro017_1117	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_120	s	How about You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ? ; This is the dimension . ; Well , this is the dimension . ; Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet .
Bro021_665	b	so there 's ; converges . ; But . ; Hmm .
Bmr008_683	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; It 's a good idea . ; Depends of who you ask , what the age range is .
Bmr014_621	%--	Ah . ; how do you call it ? ; I 'm not sure . ; With the , uh
Buw001_2108	b	and they did do recognition , ; and they did do real conversations . ; But as far as I know they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1357	%--	What sort of discourse processing is uh are the ; How much is built into SmartKom and ; It works like this . ; The uh , um I mean .
Bmr011_1823	s	which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , ; um , or to have very to have closer , um , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech ; that gets transcribed in it , or both . ; And it 's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that .
Btr001_1977	ba	And then ; I agree , ; Yeah . ; it 's it 's really interesting , Also ,
Bmr011_570	s	I mean , it seems ; Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . ; Yeah . ; it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this ,
Bmr027_1151	ba	We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets ; Yeah . ; Ugh ! ; but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task .
Bmr026_781	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . ; Wow .
Bmr027_884	bk	for your mai ? ; Yeah . ; Wow . That 's that 's my guy . ; Alright .
Btr002_2782	%	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; So . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1300	b	or not constrain them . ; Or try try to figure that out . ; I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark " I 'm talking to the computer " . ; Right .
Bsr001_191	ba	But I mean , it 's ; So you 've implemented radio buttons . ; It looks pretty slick though . ; That 's great .
Bed013_312	%--	But I 've been looking into it . ; I th @ @ It 's not like it 's a blank slate . ; I found everything that I need ; and stu and uh ,
Bed009_232	s	whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . ; And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was . ; And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . ; So if it can make a good suggestion , " Hey ! "
Bmr011_1152	b	Especially as you get , en more voices . ; The first meeting had I think just four people , ; Four speakers , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_196	%--	because I would put a lot of things into parentheses ; and then go back over it ; and go back over it again ; and still
Bmr010_681	s	But I I think that it it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible , ; Mm - hmm . ; because , um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table . ; I mean , I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway .
Bmr005_1404	s	Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . ; So then that would double what we had . ; Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW ; uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,
Bed013_702	%--	Oh . OK , but I was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm . ; But coconut anana pineapple , that 's that 's tricky , yeah . ; Sorry . ; Anyway .
Bmr006_1807	b	And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , ; Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . ; and so , uh , ; Mm - hmm . Yeah .
Bro008_348	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , training is done on different conditions and different microphones , ; and testing also is done on different microphone and conditions . ; So , probably if we only take the close microphones , I guess the results should be much much better than this .
Bmr013_390	s	That 's what I meant is ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere .
Bmr018_190	s	That 's right . ; and then we go in and adjust the boundaries . ; Yeah that 's right . ; Yeah , we haven't done that .
Bed008_251	s	No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true . ; Yeah , OK . ; Did I or didn't I ? ; Ah . Probably nothing done yet ,
Bns003_17	s	furthermore , as most of you know I will leave in tenth of December , ; I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime , ; because I get , I would like to say , different signals from Siemens , ; I believe , in the meantime it 's a higher probability that I will return ,
Btr001_372	%--	interesting . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , I mean he was never like
Bmr003_1736	s	And then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker , uh , con continuation . ; Mmm . ; Oh . ; But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought .
Bmr030_134	s	presentation mode . ; It doesn't . ; Well , because if you just touch Alt a ; If you just hit it once ? it 'll go back to the previous application .
Bmr006_1513	b	OK , so the the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . ; Those we won't be able to change . ; If someone says " Hey , Roger so - and - so " . ; Right .
Bro028_402	s	So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in , ; and see does that is that does that make the difference ? ; Uh - huh . ; If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say " OK , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . "
Bns003_805	s	I have to um well , uh , reach some goals and so on . ; But on the other hand there will be some time left I think to do some work on this area I started here . ; And for me , myself , I 'm also very interested in in continue this work ; and so that will be manageable
Bmr020_302	s	I mean ; I bet there 's a weak dependence . ; Yeah . ; I 'm sure it 's it 's not a real strong one .
Bmr023_697	b	Uh , we should use I Ds or something . ; And those don't show up . ; So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_147	s	Hmm . ; And so , um , ; uh , it 's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do . ; But the only caveat to that is that everybody 's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they 're using
Bro018_659	s	And didn't they like exponentiate or something ; Um Yeah , ; and then divide by the sum of them , ; there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that .
Bmr001_873	s	But , of course , to get zero and " O "s distinguished we you have to do it . ; That 's why , ; yep . ; But it 's kind of weird to read .
Bmr027_396	%--	I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work ; except for an additional email just saying they got the email . ; Yeah . ; And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before
Bmr030_276	aa	OK . ; Uh , t ; G Actually could you email me a reference to that paper ? If you have it ? ; Yeah , sure .
Bro022_871	b	just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , ; some sort of slope . ; And and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a a high - pass kind of characteristic ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_622	b	With no with no advance warning . ; Y you ; Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record . ; OK .
Btr002_2323	%	And it 's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it , ; but how very complicated it is when you see the words . ; Indecipherable . ; Yeah .
Bed010_766	aa	right . ; Huh ? ; The extension of of your hand , right . ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_1716	b	Yeah . ; I mean , what 're we gonna do ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed015_1171	s	or " force " , or something like that . ; But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . ; And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . ; So " path " , you could just be talking about the path between this and this .
Bmr030_97	%--	Yeah , I got it . With the instructions . ; with the instructions . ; I don't know . ; So , Morgan
Buw001_747	s	Also CMU has been doing this ; and they were the most vocal at this meeting , ; Alex Waibel 's group . ; And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time
Bmr023_690	%--	And there the prosodic features actually showed up ; and a neat thing ; even though the word features were available . ; And a neat thing there too is I tried some putting the speaker
Bed011_14	bk	Yeah , I 've I uh it 's not that I didn't try . ; OK . ; and um I I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands . ; OK .
Bmr030_841	s	Yeah . ; Oh ! I 've forgotten now . ; Um . ; I assume they 're in the P - make pool .
Bmr022_964	t3	um , just as an example for , you know , the future , of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones , ; Right . ; No ? ; How standard are these ?
Bmr010_1108	%--	Wow . ; Well , why do I wouldn't say forty - hour weeks . ; No . ; But what I mean is
Bmr019_113	aa	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr006_1818	s	OK . ; Yeah , a lot of these things are . ; Discourse . ; Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript .
Buw001_1989	bk	I don't think we should have rules of participation , ; but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . ; That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , ; OK .
Bmr030_597	bk	They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in ; and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that . ; Oh , I see . ; I see .
Bmr007_867	s	So s my intention for this is is as an aide for ground truth . ; Um but eh I but eh I I I mean that eh eh in the in the mixed file you can find , uh zone with , eh great different , eh level of energy . ; not ; Um I I think for , eh algorithm based on energy , eh , that um h mmm , more or less , eh , like eh eh , mmm , first sound energy detector .
Bed010_235	b	Absolutely . ; Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing ; That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say " this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it " and stuff like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_584	b	Yes . ; Yeah . ; So so they were saying they were not going to , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_672	cc	yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . ; so ; Right . ; Uh , we 'll see .
Bmr002_894	s	Sure . ; Right . ; Here 's another thing I got . ; Oh , so this 'd this w is probably what the L D C uses .
Bed002_702	b	So you will know . ; Mm - hmm . ; I 'm sure that , you know ; Yeah .
Bed010_1094	b	uh we have a group on the formalization , ; uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . ; So there 're various kinds of uh ; OK .
Bmr024_303	b	Yeah . ; but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation ; because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_712	bk	and then pick some from that ; Oh , OK . ; I m I mean ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1301	s	But even that is problematic . ; If you go d If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf , ; I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , ; it takes you to the the address ,
Bro019_1419	b	that one might be another thing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_870	s	And uh , ; my understanding was that , ; um ; I haven't I haven't listened to it yet ,
Bro019_1310	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints .
Buw001_1782	s	Great . ; Yeah . ; what it is . ; " Here 's a mysterious file
Bmr027_1176	bk	and ; We have actua actually I have ; W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , I was I was hanging on to the others for , eh for spares , ; Oh , OK .
Bmr028_1013	b	Right . ; So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location . ; Speaker ID . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_901	bk	like the slope of something . ; But ; you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level , ; Right .
Bmr001_401	s	And then we then we cut it in half . ; And then we cut in half , by ; How 'd you cut it ? ; But By s saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty instead of thirty - two .
Bmr023_195	aa	because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1114	no	So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that . ; Right . ; You look puzzled . ; I I just I don't quite understand what these things are .
Bns003_844	b	and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB . ; Well , ; we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about Quality of Serving routing . for MPLS in an MPLS domain . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_535	bk	So do you know the FrameNet story ? ; Um , yeah . ; Uh , not not too much , ; OK .
Bro024_799	s	I mean , i you you train it also this way ; but , i somehow there is u u there is no longer a a Gaussian distribution . ; It is somehow a strange distribution which we introduce with these artificial distortions . ; And and I was thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problems in the especially in the multi - condition training mode .
Bro004_177	aa	It 's not the digits . ; So it 's the combination of two things there . ; It 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bmr011_896	%--	Up to now it 's been monologues , uh , as far my understood . ; Yep , ; exactly . ; And and what they 're doing is
Bmr008_846	qw	so ; But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get , ; but we could say uh " where did you live before you were five ? " , ; " where did you live after you were five ? " ,
Bro003_2097	b	Oh , you ; Yeah ? ; and then at the end just chop off the final nonlinearity . ; Hmm .
Bed011_908	s	What , ; well this is the part that ; Huh ? ; this is the part that needs the work .
Bro016_179	ba	So , in effect , that 's changing the value of your insertion penalty . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's more directly like the the language scaling or the , uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling , ; That 's interesting .
Bmr019_29	s	Right . ; So . ; Any I mean , maybe not . ; Digits and alignments .
Bns001_1137	%--	so I 'd rather like to to follow it a bit , and then to get more into the ideas . ; So ; OK . ; c Can I do another one , like
Bro003_163	s	Um . Well , preparation of the French test data actually . ; OK . ; So , it means that um , ; well , it is , uh , a digit French database of microphone speech ,
Bro016_96	qw	OK . ; But it is interesting . ; You say you you have for the noisy ; How about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions ?
Bmr016_1949	s	because then you get the substitution . ; And actually , th um , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version , ; you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses , ; however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they 're saying .
Bmr025_789	s	not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . ; But then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live . ; Right . ; And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,
Buw001_578	%--	Yeah , but those are bigger deal things . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Where you 've got fifteen peo
Bro022_312	b	Did I w what ? ; Sorry ? ; Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it shouldn't have any effect . ; Yeah .
Bro024_995	no	So I have like the fifty - one point O nine ; and ; So . ; I don't know it f fares for the other conditions .
Bmr011_847	b	Yeah , ; y right , ; Mm - hmm . Then there 's their web site that has lots of papers . ; OK .
Bdb001_628	s	Sure . ; I mean , so you would you would have yet another tag . ; And then that would get a tag somehow . ; You 'd have another tag which says this is of type " sentence " .
Bns001_374	s	Remember your four and one card uh concerning um , ; what is the name , from Dataco - ? ; No . ; Dacom
Bmr016_1194	aa	So if it 's " ACL " then it 's " A " underscore " C " underscore " L " . ; And the th ; And so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ? ; Yes . Uh - huh , yeah .
Btr001_704	b	Really ? ; it 's a very slight difference , ; and then the time bin starts . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_177	cc	We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . ; Um . ; Well , finally we end up with this configuration that works , uh , quite well . ; So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system .
Bed006_1332	s	Like I said , I 'm sure I 'm just hitting everything with a hammer that I developed , ; Yeah . ; but I mean you know uh it 's ; I 'm just telling you what I think ,
Bmr009_178	b	Except that it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized . ; It 's just number of frames . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_971	b	W ; Yeah e exactly . ; Um , you know this , of course , does not make sense in light of the Statue of Liberty , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_269	%--	right ? ; Individual channels . ; Yeah . ; So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting ,
Bmr028_1393	s	Yeah , it just seems like , you know , i if it were " bootstrapping " , or if it were I mean , there are other ways to maybe get the point across . ; But it isn't bootstrapping . ; Uh , it 's it 's really cheating . ; It 's us it 's using information you wouldn't normally have .
Bro013_754	s	No , they just write ; and and people pronounce " O " or zero ; they they write down OH . ; or they write down ZERO
Bro023_644	t1	Mm - hmm . ; And " N " is the noisy power spectrum . ; And so this is the transfer function . ; Right
Buw001_1378	%--	Uh , yeah , yeah . ; Sure , sure . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that I mean ,
Bed013_191	s	And whatever that maybe that would lead to " what is the castle ? " , ; I 'm just ; or " what is that whatever " . ; I guess what I 'm afraid of is if we don't , you know , set up a situation , we 'll just get a bunch of garbage out ,
Btr002_2437	s	Yeah . ; Oh yes . ; Yeah . ; I was marking " lipsmack " ,
Bmr019_247	bk	It 's wide - band , yeah . ; It 's in in fact , we looked it up ; It is wide - band . ; OK .
Bro004_1282	h	It hopefully brings other people up to date a bit . ; And um Um I think Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit ; and think about it and and talk with everybody uh , outside of this meeting . ; Um , but uh
Bed009_485	%--	um Petra and Jan ; Mmm . ; Yeah , there 's a meeting next next week I think ; OK because That 's Those are the
Bed014_554	s	and that 's Ir - Irina Gurevich from EML who is going to be visiting us , uh , the week before , uh , August ; and a little bit into August . ; And she would like to apply the ontology that is , um being crafted at EML . ; That 's not the one I sent you .
Bns001_969	s	Probably , if after searching a little bit on the on the net I can get the answer , ; but initially this is something to to to have in mind . ; I mean . Because maybe this UMTS thing will appear on the market without IP as a native protocol . ; And if this is the case well , thus seamless integration could be we strongly affected .
Bdb001_1334	%	And I I guess the answer is , um , it 's gonna be different every time . ; It 's j it 's just gonna be ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1555	%	OK . ; OK . Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_179	s	And the other thing I think that 's interesting is , the types of the types of confusions that happen , um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , the stress tends to be preserved , ; you know , the content word will be substituted for another content word ,
Bmr010_777	s	And then also the position of the mike also . ; If it 's more directly , you 'll get better volume . ; Yeah . ; So so , like , yours is pretty far down below your mouth . Yeah .
Bmr007_433	s	I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? " ; just never mind comparison with something else , ; Mm - hmm . ; what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them .
Bmr030_645	s	Were " shortened " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Wonder if the ones before that were shortened .
Bed005_1081	s	assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? ; So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then this would represent the probability distribution . ; So maybe in this case Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . ; They want to enter it with probability , uh with probability point five
Bed011_150	%--	And um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . Um behind our backs . ; But ; Well , there are these uh uh ; oh , I see , we have to
Bed015_1062	s	you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . ; And you might that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . ; And I changed to " reference " ; cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it .
Bro023_1235	s	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; M I mean , it 's it , um ; The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean
Bns002_1588	s	And you see the difference . ; The amazing thing is that you have IP over IP . ; As you take a look to the the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and and all those things . ; And you have the GPS tunnel p uh protocol G T P between the G and the S and the GTSN .
Bro027_1927	aa	y Like sixty ? ; Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet . ; He hasn't got the results back yet . ; Yeah .
Bns001_699	s	and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different ; but from the point of view of the mobile things uh I 'm not sure if if ; It 's packaged data oriented . ; It 's not really circuit - switched .
Bro014_968	b	So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer ; because you 're just getting some characterization , ; one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_851	bk	You know like " Sussudio " , ; that horrible , horrible song that should never have been created . ; Yeah , come on . ; Oh , oh , oh , oh .
Bmr014_1031	b	" Once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community . ; There again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you 'd prefer to have excised from the database , ; and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording . " ; Hmm .
Btr002_1311	bk	I can't remember what they were , now , ; but I just remember that it was once you learned them , it was very neat and concise ; and , th like ; Excellent .
Btr001_730	b	but also sometimes there 's just like huge pads of , you know , air before and or after , um , that I don't really feel is necessary for that segment , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I usually , um , you know , shrink it a bit ; Hmm .
Bmr024_625	g	so why not ? ; Yeah . ; But but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that . ; Right ?
Bed010_412	cc	Mmm . ; And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . ; If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we we need to solve right now . ; What I 'm what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of of the internal structure .
Bro018_266	s	Yeah . ; I bet you get better than sixty - three . ; Well I don't know , ; but I th I I think that we I have the result more or less . Maybe .
Bmr007_1298	b	It 's neat . ; can you do it for them ? " ; And , no actually , you can't . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1185	s	Or Boston , yeah . ; I can't do it , but ; Or Boston ? ; And those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know .
Bns001_1170	s	Maybe I was routing mobility management ; But no one actually put them together . ; Yeah . That 's ; But So that 's the big problem .
Bed015_1611	s	Where as in English you would say , " I thought you were " . ; Right . ; Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there , ; so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah .
Bed017_181	s	But um , ; No , you would definitely have ; be able to re - use , like , um , all the user stuff , ; and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff ,
Bed015_1866	s	Yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like " speaker believes not - P " , ; No . ; you know ? ; Like " the speaker says P and believes not - P " .
Bmr030_76	%--	But , nonetheless , I think if we ; It 's a it 's a cool idea . ; And if we can actually get it get it going that would be neat . ; So And uh , this was the one also that was ,
Bed009_451	no	Indeed . ; Set - based , or even very complex structured information in these slots ; Right . ; and I 'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration .
Bro014_258	qw	Hmm . ; And so , perhaps they will change the weights to ; Yeah . ; How should that be done ?
Bmr022_1382	ba	Now But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong . ; Yeah , that 's a good point .
Btr002_3437	bk	OK . ; OK . So , who wants to start ? ; Well , I guess I 'll start . ; OK .
Bmr031_1420	s	OK . ; Anything else ? ; So . Well , I 'll just really briefly , um ; So , I 've been working with Don and also and and Andreas on the this paper on prosody ,
Bmr027_298	bk	Uh , the f ; so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify . ; Well , the form Well , the form doesn't say , if uh , you know , " if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks " ; I see .
Bmr021_930	b	Um so the ; Yeah , and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front - end to perform better . ; Um . And and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can I can certainly run a SRI system without VTL ; Yep .
Btr002_736	bk	Or " someone 's about to laugh really loudly " , ; And so you turn it down ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bed011_1114	s	Mm - hmm . ; And um " Tell me something about X . " ; Yeah . ; And hey , that 's that 's already covering eighty percent of the system 's functionality .
Bmr021_976	b	But it might be important . For um ; Go ahead . ; So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where it was later found that several of the s microphones were turned off , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1308	b	Good example , the same one I 'm asking . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , e I see . ; Yeah .
Bed006_898	s	Mm - hmm . ; and it 's not ; uh I don't know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema SPG schema ; it it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container
Bed013_944	br	Ouch . ; So , ; we have discussed in terms of the EVA ; Grateful for us ?
Bmr022_961	s	Oh , I 'm sorry . ; You 're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sonys . ; Well , ; um , just as an example for , you know , the future , of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones ,
Bmr022_1002	b	you know , we have a base station somewhere , ; and you 're wandering around , uh , hands free , ; and ; Yep .
Bmr015_406	bd	But , um ; Uh , I don't remember , ; but it 's pr probably along the li ; I I could be wrong on this
Bed011_292	qy	I mean , one is a planner The other , it kind of give you instructions on the spot ; Yeah , but th the I don't I 'm not really interested in sort of " Phase planning " capabilities . ; But it 's more the how do people phrase these planning requests ? ; So are we gonna masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system ,
Bns003_698	b	Mm - hmm . ; but but the thing is that you 're not supposed to do it . ; And usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_305	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So they would like clean channels . ; Uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out .
Bmr030_632	ba	So they 're smaller . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; That 's still pretty dang big .
Buw001_1476	b	Yeah , really . ; Yeah . ; If they 're real queries . ; Yeah .
Bed017_177	s	And so , ; I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , ; cuz otherwise you would c ; well , it 's probably the same .
Bed011_657	s	But what about uh ; Mm - hmm ; Yep . ; So , like " Go to a movie " is now entertainment ,
Bmr020_1078	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; so , ; it 's sort of a compromise ,
Bmr031_733	b	and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions . ; You just partition them into multiple . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1255	s	Clean training and ; Uh , sorry ? ; It 's clean training ; Well , close microphone training and distant microphone , um , high speed , I think .
Bed003_1153	%--	OK . ; Oh . ; That would be awesome . ; Because uh
Bmr027_491	%--	I think they 'd appreciate it . ; Yeah . My Adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation , ; Mm - hmm . ; of of how my my
Bed002_1189	%--	and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . ; I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site ; or You know , how ; Uh I I I um , OK , I t
Btr002_1630	s	or , um or ; Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like like , um , Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo ; Like , those groups ? ; It whichever .
Bmr001_548	s	So I think it On on each block it 'll it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think it does that . ; Yeah , so , P Z
Bmr012_1138	2	The Springer mike . ; Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up ; and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to ; A hand - held ,
Bed015_1208	s	Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely , it is one way to for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . ; And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? ; Well , maybe there are other things . ; You know , now that it 's subject is more like a topic .
Bmr031_1237	s	but right now I guess , uh , I 'm working on this paper this ISCA paper for this workshop that Liz and Andreas and I are putting together . ; So we 're just getting , uh , different results for ; Um , we fixed up our different , uh , transcripts with different types of , uh , annotations ; and we re re - ran ali re - ran alignments .
Bmr002_1154	s	do we have anything else to talk about with transcribes ? ; Well , what is what is the goal ? ; again ? ; We 're going to end up with some I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings .
Bro010_815	%--	um , ; they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , um , training up a detector that detects for , um , these phonetic features ; for example , um , he presents um , uh , a detector to detect sonorance . ; And so what what it basically is is , um it 's there 's
Bmr016_2201	aap	Yes , they have . ; And I know I 've seen @ @ I 've seen they 've been channelized , ; All ten hours ? ; Except for the missing thirty minutes .
Bmr018_1451	b	cuz we already have ; Yeah , we do have word transcripts . ; Mm - hmm . ; you know ,
Bmr027_416	s	It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . ; We make the effort . ; They have opt in and opt out . ; And there are two different ways .
Bns002_1308	s	within one one area . ; Yeah . ; to be compatible with existing digital European cordless telephones . ; So , hopefully , we will be able to use some of our old devices or maybe our our cordless phone base station at home , with a computer . S
Bed009_102	b	Yeah , very much ; OK , before before you got put to work ? ; Yeah ; Great .
Bed003_329	bk	What 's what 's " Disc admission fee " ? ; whether they discuss the admission fees . ; So we looked at the data ; Oh .
Bdb001_736	bk	No , that 's not clear . ; uh ; I mean , yeah , you c sure you can do it , ; Well , OK .
Bns001_790	s	uh , ; Nobody really wants a a guest on your network . ; Unless you get some money through some way uh through some way . ; Then , there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the Barwan project , as you said , go through proxies .
Bro025_353	bk	Yeah . The you smooth it and then delay the decision by ; So . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr006_451	ba	Oh , that 's a good idea . ; It 'd be fun . ; Yeah . ; I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know .
Btr001_758	s	because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins . ; Although I found one in actually I was just working right before this meeting , one where someone said , " great " ; and ; the the G it was pronounced as a K
Bsr001_2013	s	NIST headers . ; Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ? ; Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz . ; Bits , sixteen - K ,
Bmr003_1997	bk	Wonderful . ; OK . ; I 'm not sure how how important that distinction is . ; I don't think we should say , " oh , it 's internal
Bed003_226	%--	Uh . ; So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , ; right ? ; So the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some Like , the someone s
Bdb001_1295	%--	You were saying that you didn't think we should ; Time is passing ! ; Time time times are ephemeral . ; Andreas was saying
Bmr019_1169	%--	uh , this this is just maybe someone has s some some ideas about how to do it better , ; Mmm . ; but we So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels . ; We 're
Bmr006_722	s	The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study ; what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . ; Mmm . ; And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set .
Bro028_301	%--	so the ear is not trained to recognize this . ; But s actually it sound like whispering , ; so we are ; Well , I mean , it 's
Bsr001_411	b	Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application . ; Huh . ; And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous . ; OK .
Btr002_2845	s	Yeah . ; It 's different . ; Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that 's n unnatural and forced . ; Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says their little schpiel
Bmr002_1050	qy	what might you do with it ? ; So , ; if they occur to you . ; So , like " did the French system use Tcl ? "
Bns001_1666	s	Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it , ; but eh f to me u ; what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by , ; like the industry is already behind this .
Bmr015_1138	b	you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe , ; u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot . ; If there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that . ; Yeah .
Bro011_410	aa	Yeah he 's he 's he 's at Motorola now . ; Oh is he ? ; Oh OK . ; Yeah .
Bro022_161	aa	So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? ; And we 'll do ; Oh . ; OK ,
Bro028_510	s	and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it . ; So I 'm waiting to hear from him . ; But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is . ; Uh , they on their web site they , uh , did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task .
Bro018_408	b	Mm - hmm . ; but . ; I this more or less anything ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1228	s	I I thought of some extra a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention . ; OK . ; One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . ; So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine
Bmr030_538	s	Yeah . ; Um , either IO load or processor load . ; I see . ; You know , it 's a problem with these multi - user systems is that lots of processes are running
Bmr008_637	s	Mm - hmm . ; If we release this corpus , what do we want , ; I mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended then you need someone needs to enter that , ; and they 'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use that without mapping it .
Bns001_1260	s	and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain ? ; So it means that packet are delivering information , ; and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process . ; It 's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet ,
Bed009_552	s	In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; And even on on a more basic level the the action planner actually needs to be able to have um an expressive power that can deal with these structures .
Bed017_442	s	And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , ; and find out which um which questions are worth um , asking . ; And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , ; and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way .
Bro014_1123	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I guess that makes sense . ; What happen if what we have have what we would like to have is some spectrum of the excitation signal ,
Bro026_881	aa	F um , I 'm ; Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , ; right ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr015_1205	s	because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed . ; OK . ; So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , ; and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time ,
Bmr018_1364	b	Yeah . ; So they were command and control and that sort of thing . ; TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal . ; Yep .
Buw001_14	s	It just it really hurts . ; It gives you a headache , ; like if you ; Temple squeezers .
Bro005_402	b	And we s we can ; first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , ; and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_982	s	and people would plug them in . ; You could use they could use their own . ; Oh , right . So they could use the ; I wonder if you could do an adaptor .
Bmr028_134	%--	It could Do you have to put it in your ear ? ; You c you clip that part over your ear . ; I can I can do that ; but there 's no orientation where the
Bmr027_1153	s	Ugh ! ; but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this with this respect to this particular task . ; Well , return the old ones . ; It 's probably impedance matching problems .
Bed015_795	b	Yeah . ; You know , a a nominal expression . ; And , um , ; Yeah .
Bro022_125	s	then ; after after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . ; Right ? ; Um , that 's that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task .
Bed015_1022	s	And sort of this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . ; But for instance you could imagine instead of having ; I I changed the name of um it used to be " entities " . ; So you see it 's " scenario " , " referent " and " discourse segment " .
Bmr024_1426	%--	I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So the oth the other thing that
Bed002_1269	s	and now we add this little thing to it " , ; you know ? ; whatever , ; Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net ,
Bmr010_505	s	Mm - hmm . ; That that , you know , that would g help in terms of encoding of overlaps . ; The the transcribers would have less , uh , disentangling to do if that were available . ; Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is ,
Bro007_352	b	Um OK ; so if we can know what how many words are in each ; and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1634	aa	Was this done ; Mm - hmm . ; And and you are looking into the future , into the past . ; Right .
Bro005_1350	s	Well I figured that , ; but That what what what were you involved in in this primarily ? ; Um , helping out uh , preparing ; Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff
Bmr012_275	%	but ; Um But that shouldn't affect anything ; so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice , ; S
Bed014_671	aa	So when you admit have admission fee and it changes something , it 's only for that particular It 's relational , right ? ; It 's only for that particular object . ; Yeah , I th th ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1059	%	and and these ; Right . ; There 's just probably less backchannelling in general , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_98	s	So So what I was suggesting to him is that ; So just some kind of a simple ; Actually , a PDF . ; But , you know , uh But , either way .
Bed013_842	b	Way ! ; Is it ? ; Someone 's gonna start making Phil Collins jokes . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1193	ba	What you 're saying is we have a Where - X question , Where - X node , that makes both happy . ; Right ? ; That 's what you 're proposing , which is , in my mind ; just as fine .
Bro027_2045	qw	Yeah . ; So . ; Cool . ; When is the evaluation ?
Bmr011_396	s	It it actually looks somewhat different , ; Hmm . ; so . ; Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that um , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes .
Btr001_1900	ba	I went on I actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago . ; so . ; Neat . ; Oh , cool .
Buw001_234	s	And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . ; And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , ; how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group ; and and , uh , they were fine with it .
Bmr006_971	cc	in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what uh ; And ; Right . ; I I I will include too the the the differential de derivates too .
Buw001_179	b	You know , probably with double - sided tape , ; but So . ; You So we won't have to go through that . ; Hmm .
Bns002_1511	s	They say they are very interested in it . ; OK . ; Yeah ? ; Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it ,
Bmr016_1766	s	it 's in the language model , ; w ; yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of " tickle " . ; Well " tickle " was pronounced " tickle " .
Bro013_743	b	No . ; I mean . I think people will do what they say . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Btr002_2507	s	Because I think it 's communicative of a certain thing . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know what I am never sure whether or not to transcribe , um , a difference with , like , " hmm " , you know , and " hmm ! " .
Bro021_610	b	Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_770	b	you can't fine tune the meeting that much , I think . ; Right . ; It 's sort of ; Yeah .
Bmr027_868	bk	But why shouldn't they just email back ? ; So . ; Yeah . Reply . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1201	s	Make stuff better . ; OK . ; Uh . Yeah . ; And CPU memory issues .
Bmr002_999	%--	I mean ; Well , I think ; What what is what is what is this web page from ? ; Well , I apparently ,
Bmr008_841	s	Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve , ; And Oh , that 's interesting . ; right ? ; So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you 're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns ,
Btr002_422	s	" Group of , groups of , groups of , group s " ; " Fff " . Because also , I mean , " F " is " Fff " . is , um , " Fff " . ; Gruesome groups of gruesome groups of ; I wonder where the " P " went , though ?
Bmr028_341	s	And , uh , my talk 's the first day . ; So . ; OK . ; I 'm flying out there the Sunday before .
Bmr016_1727	bk	So this this happens in the very first one . ; Mm - hmm . ; I actually wrote it as " tickle " . ; OK .
Bro013_596	%--	OK . ; So the envelope here is the output of the mel - filters ; Mm - hmm . ; and what we clearly see is that in some cases ,
Bro022_841	s	Um , ; I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , um , energy - based VAD that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . ; Um . ; So , which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy ,
Bmr005_315	b	Yeah , you could do all these inferences , ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed009_440	%--	Yep . ; Now I dunno how much people have thought ahead to the tourist domain in this ; Probably not enough , ; I mean an another uh more basic point there is that the current um tasks and therefore th the concepts in this ac
Bed003_764	%--	Yep . ; But uh We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd ; I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually ; We were thi
Bmr014_455	s	But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , ; because , you know I mean , jus ; You don't know what they could be . ; Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear
Bro018_608	b	There 's lots of look ups . ; So a long time ago people talked about things where you would have uh a condensed nearest - neighbor , ; where you would you would you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent to to correctly classify everything that came in . ; Oh .
Bro027_100	h	And , uh ; Uh , throwing away the first ? ; Yeah . ; Um ,
Bmr016_1657	aa	Is this after like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of " OK " to this ? ; Seven hundred eighty . ; Yeah . ; Of " OK " , yes .
Bmr015_302	s	And ; uh , which was also true for the pre - proposal , ; so . ; Uh , there 'll be bunch of people working on it .
Btr001_729	s	definitely when something 's cut off at the beginning or the end ; but also sometimes there 's just like huge pads of , you know , air before and or after , um , that I don't really feel is necessary for that segment , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I usually , um , you know , shrink it a bit
Bro024_342	bk	Right . ; I I see . ; I was I was about to say . So if if you ask it " What what movies are on TV tonight ? " , ; Yeah .
Bro003_1173	no	or is it a ? ; mmm ; Um . Who is that ? ; I don't know .
Bed015_1673	b	It would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism ; since there are so many cases where you actually need ; it 'll be one or the other . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_542	s	Eleven hours ? ; Wow ! ; Oh . ; Yeah , the archiving m program does take a long time .
Bed006_1087	b	Between you guys ; uh ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr027_551	%--	Mm - hmm . ; so I I I I 'm pretty comfortable with that . ; Do you track , um , when people log in ; to look at the ?
Btr002_2867	b	it was overlaps , that I was thinking about . ; Uh - huh . I think this is really ; Not enough overlaps . ; yeah .
Bmr028_296	ba	I did it once before ; and it was just so slow to scroll , that I gave up . ; Huh . ; But , the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate .
Bro004_371	b	It sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using . ; Yeah . ; But but i it sounds like ; Um , but He Mm - hmm .
Bed008_498	co	Hmm . ; this i anyway , this i ; OK . ; at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out .
Bed003_139	g	OK . ; Yeah but if it 's architecturally significant you might be able to see it from ; Like you m might be able to " Vista " it , ; right ?
Bed006_1153	b	And , as a matter of fact , when I have traveled with my friends we make these exactly these kinds of appointments . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_984	bk	Right . ; But uh it 's free . ; Which is w quite positive , ; yeah .
Bro025_590	bk	VAD . ; Oh . ; And ; OK .
Bro027_663	s	Uh ; But still , that 's that 's a pretty big , uh , win . ; And it doesn't seem like you 're in terms of your delay , you 're , uh , that ; He added a bit on ,
Bed006_726	bk	Right ? ; This is ; Right . Currently . ; OK .
Bmr016_1575	ba	Yeah , we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I agree . ; It 's not so bad .
Bro014_1039	%--	And i the interpolation i between the point is give for the triang triangular filter , the value of the triangular filter ; and of this way we obtained this mode this model speech . ; So you essentially take the values that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them ; S
Bro024_486	s	I mean , I I found that the results ; I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit . ; So I was like looking into " why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? " . ; Why why I was not getting it .
Bro023_732	s	Yeah . ; so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter . ; Mm - hmm . ; Like , you estimate the edge of square
Bmr026_1074	s	But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? ; Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got ; Uh well . It depended on the task . ; I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important
Bro027_554	s	a hundred for the smoothing . ; Yeah . ; Well , but at ten , ; Twenty for the delta .
Bed008_1450	s	Yeah . ; Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , ; where are we gonna get data ? ; Well I mean we need data with people intentions ,
Bmr024_1636	bk	So , if you sorta plug your ears and read ; OK . ; So first read the transcript number , and then start reading the digits . ; Sure .
Bmr016_842	bk	Eighteen . ; Eigh - eighteen . ; It was a spare that Dave had around ; Oh OK .
Bro003_548	bk	um , right . ; Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six . ; Sixty - one . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr018_294	x	but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries , ; correcting the boundaries . ; You shouldn't have to tighten them too much because Thilo 's program does that . ; Should be pretty good ,
Bro005_385	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , it 's ; Yeah . ; the French and the Spanish .
Btr001_1669	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The I mean ; but also if they have it all pre - segmented and they can only hear the segments , they often miss what 's in between
Bmr021_163	s	yeah , but I know but I mean to have the user fill it out wouldn't be as reliable as have the ; No , no , we definitely would not have the user fill it out . ; Good , OK . ; It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is .
Bro013_88	b	We 've been playing a number of states ; Mm - hmm . ; uh I I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the uh number of Gaussians yet ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_312	s	Well , ninety ; No , I I mean ninety ; It 's around eighty - nine , ; ninety ,
Bsr001_2099	b	OK . ; So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro022_1171	s	I r I 'm not sure . ; I don't I don't know absolutely nothing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS ,
Bro013_532	s	Yeah so it 's ; And the ; doesn't do too well there . ; I think that this is good .
Bmr006_1629	%--	because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . ; and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions . ; So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . ; Oh . I think that My understanding from Yen
Bro018_358	no	Mc - McDonald 's constant . ; I don't know exactly , ; because well th I thought maybe they have a meaning . ; But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value .
Bed010_216	s	It 's got . ; huh ? ; Yeah . ; What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who 's interested ,
Bmr016_1916	ba	Yeah . ; it seems like there are lots of different ways it 's being done . ; OK . ; Interesting question .
Bed017_392	s	because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that ; is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , ; and uh , ; I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems
Bro003_1113	s	but we 've I don't think we 've tested that . ; Right ? ; So , in the broader training corpus we can we can use , uh , the three , or , a combination of of two two languages . ; Database three .
Bed009_565	b	cuz that 's what everybody else calls it . ; I would think , ; yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr022_340	ba	s ; So it would be a number and a beep . ; e ; It 's a shame we can't do that .
Bro018_71	bk	I I 'll ; The spectral shape , ; yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro027_1682	bk	where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it hasn't seen , actually , ; Mm - hmm . ; from the f f while testing . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro014_799	s	which is the Italian mismatch , ; so . ; Uh . ; We have to wait for that to fill the whole table ,
Bmr008_860	qw	So if we ask the question about dialect regions , it makes no sense to say where do you live now . ; Right . ; Right ? ; You ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect style .
Bed003_1149	s	So in what sense has he updated it ? ; Well th you can either you ca or you can read both . ; Oh . I see . ; To my understanding .
Btr002_2913	b	But it 's still It 's still the case . ; Uh - huh . ; You have ; Yeah .
Bed013_142	s	It wouldn't know what to ask . ; I mean . ; It shur ; Unless it was in a situation .
Btr001_304	ba	Oh OK . ; I think so , ; yeah . ; Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting .
Btr002_1888	s	I had ; Yeah . ; I had one where they were just they were just , like , talking about each word , you know , ; and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again ,
Bmr028_747	qw	That 's really great . ; Excuse me ? ; I was just thinking we store our data on Popcorn . ; How many how many institutes can you say do that ?
Bmr012_95	bk	Ah . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bed004_328	b	Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p very bottom looks like , ; or is that it ? ; Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says " Mode " which is the decision between the ; Yeah .
Bns001_601	%	n uh ; It 's funny . ; Uh , sorry ? ; Uh do
Btr002_1737	no	Mm - hmm . ; because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot , ; and ; I don't know .
Bro012_52	no	but it 's ; What 's the cut - off frequency it used ? ; Oh . ; I don't know
Btr002_861	qw	But . ; Yeah . ; That 's it 's good to be careful about the mousing . ; You were gonna say ?
Bmr028_1490	qw	I mean , suppose you just know that . ; Same cheating . ; And then then , even if you know that , can that help you ? ; I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ?
Bmr014_557	%--	Is that is that that including digits ? ; Yes it is . ; Yeah . ; So let 's say roughly ten hours or so of
Bmr021_45	s	Just two more of those , ; um . And that that 's easy ; and that will certainly work . ; The other option is to try yet another mike .
Bmr028_1435	t1	and ; we 're ; or ; Shoot .
Bmr011_984	qw	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ?
Bmr023_898	b	We had some problems before with offsets . ; This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . ; So we we had , uh ; Hmm .
Bmr024_586	s	So so they were saying they were not going to , ; Yeah . ; OK . ; and I said , " well that 's silly , if if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . "
Bed013_373	%--	Like I 'd I what I didn't do is go to the web site of the conference ; and look at what they 're looking for or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , it seems to me that um
Bro017_411	s	Hmm . ; So this is uh what 's happening . ; Then Sunil is uh uh uh asked me f for one month 's vacation ; and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no I didn't have heart to tell him no .
Bro025_698	s	um , as as a starting point for the project . ; Um . ; In in my proposal , I I was thinking about starting from a set of , uh , phonological features , or a subset of them . ; Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John .
Btr002_754	s	So . ; Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; Right . ; and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful .
Btr002_614	s	then it becomes a matter of , Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range . ; And , I didn't really have the sense that it would . ; I didn't get that from him , actually . ; I felt like , um , he 's basically saying that for our for all intents and purposes with this , it 's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered , like everything .
Bmr009_1081	t1	I really am . ; Yeah . ; I mean , if if you 're in New England , that 's North . ; I agree .
Bro012_56	bk	I wrote this a while ago ; Is it like twenty ? ; Something like that . ; Yeah .
Bro005_800	s	And the question is now how to how to get one and not the other ? ; Or how to how to ameliorate the the problems . ; Mmm . ; Um , because it it certainly does is nice to have in there , when it when there is something like the training data .
Bmr007_1332	aap	Mm - hmm . ; Well , I can wear it , I mean if you ; Oh . ; It doesn't matter .
Bro014_1526	b	I mean , it 's ; um , ; certainly in a short short - term this just sounds easier . ; Uh - huh .
Bns001_401	s	I see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea . ; Um . ; It 's only to set up i u ; For me it 's like a laptop t to plug one PCMCIA and currently will have two PCMCIA cards , and I compare GSM with UMTS .
Bed004_438	%--	Yeah . ; And , um ; So . ; So in that case , the sum we 'd have we
Bmr009_450	aa	No . ; It could it probably does happen sometimes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1467	s	OK , thanks . ; And what I 'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there . ; So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? ; So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me .
Bmr011_204	%--	You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , ; so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? ; Is that what you mean ? ; Or ?
Bmr027_437	2	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . We never really talked about that . ; Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you .
Bed008_820	s	and so ; I I don't yet know how to do this , ; I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out uh discourse properties like we have object properties ; and we don't know what they are yet .
Bns002_892	s	Yeah , let let me let me answer you uh with a question . ; Uh , If , for example , your car uh you you have uh an endless uh source of of gas , do you think it will it will be a problem , the amount of gas your your car is is using ? ; OK . ; It won't be a problem for your pocket ,
Btr002_1795	s	It 's not a bell . ; It 's not s it 's not a " dong " . ; It 's not a ; I mean , you there 're all these words that I could imagine
Buw001_1210	b	But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . ; That 's what I 'm worried about . ; So you might as well just give him the summaries . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1456	bk	plus anything that 's real timely . ; OK . ; Oh . OK . ; OK .
Bed015_1542	b	Mm - hmm . ; Twhhh - whhh . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1547	b	so ; Well , it will inspire me . ; Right , sure sure . ; Right .
Bmr018_176	b	Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe . ; Right . ; But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to f ; OK .
Bro003_1348	b	which requires some tables . ; And , uh , ; so it 's it 's it 's a little messier , ; Hm - hmm .
Bed011_581	bk	It ; Right . ; For this . ; OK .
Bed010_283	s	I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running ; because ; e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . ; And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work .
Bmr031_1485	s	Yeah . ; cuz there 's a similar project at SRI where we 're using we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the p stylized pitch stuff is , um , sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark . ; Yeah . ; So , I I actually wanted to talk to you about that .
Bmr010_1196	x	If you have a if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner . ; If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in in taking less time to correct things . ; So so ; OK .
Bmr011_34	s	Well , I had a just a quick question ; but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , ; but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . ; OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now .
Bmr023_45	%--	Well , we started recording , but Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Is Jane around ; or ?
Bmr031_981	bk	for a while they were doing it after this meeting . ; Oh ! ; Yeah . Wednesdays , Fridays ; OK .
Bmr012_1103	s	Without getting more stuff . ; cuz ; so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen ; and there 's six on the table
Bmr023_1053	s	But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components . ; Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features , ; Yeah . ; so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more .
Bed014_421	%--	Communication . ; Communication , documentation and stuff . ; Hunh ! ; Anyway , so , uh , with a little luck
Bmr018_1687	b	I think the matters is the thing that that was misleading . ; so ; That was very offending , ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro021_375	%--	Yeah . I think th th uh , the new system that I tested is , I guess , closer ; because it doesn't have it have less of of France Telecom stuff , ; You mean the ; I
Bmr019_822	bk	like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word ; Yeah . ; and then we could , you know , do some adjustments . ; I OK .
Bmr013_910	s	Yeah . ; So a lot of little details , ; but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . ; So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer
Bmr008_650	aa	I mean , I guess what you really want , is if there 's some information you wanna know ; Mm - hmm . ; So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically . ; That 's it .
Bmr023_204	aa	We should we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1572	aa	Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ ; Well , we 're piloting . ; We 'll just do it and see what happens . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1681	bk	Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here . ; Uh . ; You know , maybe , have it be somewhat visual , a little bit . ; OK .
Bns001_1713	s	So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there ; and just do uh I Ps playing over radio . ; Mm - hmm . ; Something like that is my final vision .
Bro003_1805	%--	So . ; Um . ; So , uh . ; So I think
Bed008_1444	bk	Based on training data , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr007_854	s	All of which are definitely acoustic events . ; They 're definitely someone talking . ; But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing . ; And then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .
Bed009_399	aa	whatever it is . ; So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff . ; uh But I think that isn't what you mean . ; No .
Bro005_337	b	So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um and we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . ; Yeah
Bmr001_202	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; Well n
Bro028_817	%--	Right . ; So you you have the distributions from the training set , ; N ; and then , uh
Bro018_232	s	OK . ; But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone . ; Mm - hmm . ; That I look in the with the other nnn the other MLP that we have are more or less the same number .
Bns001_737	bk	wide - band w uh CDMA . ; These kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched . ; But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing here . ; Right ,
Bed010_134	s	OK , you know how to do it ? ; For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . ; And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . ; That 's , you know , that 's that 's HPSG or whatever .
Bed013_1215	s	OK . ; So I agree with that . ; I have a different kinda question , ; might be related ,
Bmr008_1341	%--	Another side . ; an alteration in th in the tracking way . ; Excuse me ? ; You mean that eh you ehm mmm
Bed004_762	s	i This this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work . ; So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more . ; Um . In particular ; see what we 'd like to do , and and this has been implicit in the discussion , is to do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use .
Bmr008_844	s	So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you 're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns , ; you know uh ; so ; But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get ,
Bed014_162	cc	Anyway , it We 'll sort this out . ; Um . ; But anyway , send me the note ; and then I 'll - I 'll check with , uh , Morgan on the money .
Bmr010_68	co	Which is ? ; I beg your pardon ? ; What 's the interesting stuff ? ; Yeah . Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part .
Bro012_758	s	I brought some I don't know if some figures here . ; Well . I start we started to work on spectral subtraction . ; And um the preliminary results were very bad . ; So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization .
Bed003_1434	s	you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . ; It 's amazing what human beings can do . ; W when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station ; and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says New York
Bmr006_1368	b	Yeah . ; But but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . ; Whatever you 're interested in . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_333	b	Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through . ; But i but it 's very quick , ; And if ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_1239	s	but then you get a different noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , um , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises . ; It did seem to help .
Bed004_314	s	so what I did was I took ; I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector . ; Yep . ; And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .
Bmr024_874	s	And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once . ; Well , we 're alright for now ; because the network 's so slow . ; I mean , I think I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it ,
Bro023_424	b	yeah . ; And what did ; So , what was the , um , uh , corresponding number , say , for , um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ? ; Mmm .
Bro010_679	s	Well , ; I think ; Yeah . ; Well , in in the paper he showed that actually the estimation of the noise is is delayed .
Bmr025_901	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , I do like the idea of having a couple buttons ; Well I 'm sure there would ; Yeah .
Bmr026_157	b	He 's sort of been been volunteering for everything ; and and uh ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_969	s	Oh ! ; I mean it ; Right , ; I mean w I mean what I would I was interested in is having a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech
Bro027_481	s	and it 's used before the delta computation . ; So if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , ; right ? ; I I 'm confused .
Bmr028_1074	bk	We should at least get a first one . ; Something . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bns002_1533	s	one ; pair ; pair ; Perez .
Bmr014_603	bk	There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels ; Across all of them . ; yeah . ; OK .
Bed017_520	s	Mm - hmm . ; So I think that 's that 's crucial for for the success of or @ @ ; So , you 're not ; I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups ,
Bed004_857	s	OK , yeah ? ; I had one more thing . ; I don't remember . ; I just forgot it again .
Bmr028_204	bk	A new transcript . ; Yep . ; Well , a new meeting , a transcript . Right . ; Right .
Buw001_730	s	And if it 's simple as I mean , as simple as just the digital ; Otherwise you 'd you lose it . ; Yeah . ; Well , minimally , I mean , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people ,
Buw001_705	s	And ; the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it .
Bmr027_1084	s	Um . OK , the next one , ; uh , this is a term . ; The problem with terminology . ; Description with th the transcriber has " X as an advance " .
Btr002_630	aa	um , except for those cases , it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear . ; I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed015_775	s	Or it 's uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things , ; or stress this value as opposed to other things . ; So , um , ; it 's it is kind of like a profile profile - background thing
Bro028_1025	s	And those filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics . ; And so in fact they 're multi - scale . ; But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like " let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there " , and so forth . ; It 's more like , you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful .
Bro024_1628	b	And then it 's , uh ; What was it ? ; This ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_213	b	They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture . ; Oh , OK . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed005_672	%--	but I 'm just ; But the ; Yeah , OK . ; So I just
Buw001_231	s	And ; There 's there 's another problem ; which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . ; And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously .
Bed006_993	%--	so it would be considered valid if we have an SPG action " Enter " and no SPG schema , but a forced action schema . ; Could happen . ; Whi - which is not bad , ; because I mean , that there 's multiple sens
Bed009_984	h	Are you guys free at five ? ; Or Do you have to go somewhere at five o ' clock tonight ? ; W in ten minutes ? ; Ah
Bed003_1761	%--	And um ; OK . ; So the ideal task um , will have whatever ; I don't know how much the structure of the evolving Bayes - net will af affect
Bed013_1367	b	Now cross your fingers . ; Yeah , I I mean , for me this is just a ba matter of curiosity , ; I wanna would like to look at uh , what this ad - hoc process of designing a belief - net would actually produce . ; Yeah . Yeah .
Bro005_1206	no	We 've been sort of ignoring that , ; haven't we ? ; But ; Yeah , so I don't know .
Btr002_3082	b	That actually ; I 've heard " shoot " a couple of times . ; I 've heard the ; Yeah .
Bmr002_892	aa	OK . ; And so um I think it would be something that we should work uh together with , in terms of uh seeing how this ; Sure . ; Right .
Bro014_1372	s	This is the signal . ; for that ? ; This is the signal . ; I see that .
Bmr026_915	s	And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system ; and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ? ; Well , I 'm ; Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses .
Bmr022_81	s	So ; Hunh . ; Wasn't that what you said ? ; Sort of a text template ,
Bro021_1299	bk	um . Well , only one ; There 's only one Gaussian . ; I am only using only one . ; Right .
Bed003_913	s	Let 's see . ; So this is " has door " ; Uh , true , false . ; That 's acceptable .
Bed004_472	b	Mmm . ; and , um , I understand where this the uh ; this is a way of playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way . ; Yeah .
Bed015_267	%--	So that 's a useful thing ; so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . ; OK , so that all looks good . ; Let me
Bed013_1146	bk	No . Not at all . ; OK . ; Where it is located , we have , a user proximity node here somewhere , ; OK . OK .
Bmr020_161	%--	In in terms of what ? ; Number of words . ; In term ; One ?
Bmr024_574	%	" No ! " ; if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine . ; And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense . ; O
Bns002_122	s	And another another application , for example , NASA is is uh studying , is uh the use of these networks , these ad - hoc networks , for sending multiple probes , uh , um uh missions . ; So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission , ; the cellular vehicle was only one , and was uh walking around , uh roaming around the base station , which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network , ; but it was only one mobile node , of course .
Bmr028_325	ba	But ; Well , it is wonderful . ; It is , for prototyping and user interface . ; It 's just really the language is awful .
Bed009_91	b	When needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth . ; OK that sounds great . ; And um also um Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working . ; Mmm .
Bed006_1778	b	But what if it 's not an action ? ; The kids 'll like it . ; Yeah all the kids 'll love it . ; Hmm .
Bed009_934	%--	because , you know , English , ; well ; Oh OK , ; so it yeah , s s I thought I 'd
Bns003_390	%--	And this is not on the web , ; No , ; no , no . ; and the the the
Bed015_1842	aa	you know , there 's all sorts of God knows , irony , and stuff like ; Yeah . ; which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_281	bk	And I 've got some some kind of manual down in my office . ; Well , maybe we should get it ; and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_17	aa	uh , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? ; I c I could talk about the meeting . ; Does everyone has everyone met Don ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1433	ba	under Don 's supervision , actually . ; So that 's good . ; Right . ; So these offices are being , uh , very busy
Bro017_902	b	Hmm . ; That 's right . ; OK . ; yeah .
Bed005_1500	%--	Yeah , uh - huh . ; OK . ; Alright , great ! ; And , Robert , thank you for coming in under
Bed006_625	s	OK . ; And um . ; And then you pick pick a movie and and and it show shows you the times ; and you pick a time
Buw001_2057	s	Mm - hmm . ; What what do they ; And there was a big division , ; so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data .
Bro019_1526	%--	It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort . ; Oh , no . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you just
Bed005_667	no	Hmm ? ; OK . ; We don't I mean , that 's an issue . ; We don't know what , entirely .
Bed006_1066	aa	because they 're two different things ; one of which is l ; you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever pre - condition for the second . ; Yeah , yeah !
Bro013_81	s	Yeah , ; but he 's doing it with the same data , right ? ; Yeah . ; I mean so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected .
Bro011_673	b	Yeah . ; You know , ; so . ; Right .
Btr001_2258	bk	and you say " so " . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah ,
Bed014_624	b	Yeah , relevance . ; Yeah . ; I mean , we could look at dialo ; Yeah .
Bro023_863	%	it has the overall power spectrum of speech . ; So with a bump around one kilohertz . ; So when y when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at a particular frequency bin ? ; i
Bmr028_876	s	Mm - hmm . ; And ; Yeah . We we should try ; We just don't know how bad it will be .
Bro014_1154	%--	What does it look like for unvoiced ? ; Yeah . ; You have several some unvoiced ? ; The dif
Bed017_696	cc	So , um ; Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , ; OK ? ; And then we 'll go .
Bed015_1497	g	And down there in the speaker - hearer part ? ; S so , that 's I think that 's just ; n ; for instance , Speaker is known from the situation , right ?
Buw001_229	s	Right . ; So . ; And ; There 's there 's another problem
Bro013_197	s	Sure , but I mean , ; um point eight percent is something like double uh or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also .
Bro018_329	s	to look at the code ; and something like that ; to know exactly what they are doing ; because maybe that we can have some ideas
Bed015_741	%--	I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . ; So , um , like " stress " , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's just a
Bmr010_128	b	which is an HMM - ba based system with Gaussian mixtures for s speech and nonspeech . ; And it was a system which used only one Gaussian for silence and one Gaussian for speech . ; And now I added , uh , multi - mixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_110	s	I 'd like to have many different speakers . ; So , um I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine ,
Bns002_1197	s	no . ; Eleven - B is only for for uh radio ; and it 's only for uh direct sequences spread spectrum . ; OK , DSS .
Bmr005_746	bs	Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation . ; right ? ; I 'm sorry . ; So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures
Bro007_543	aa	Oh , Stephane always has these great ideas ; and ; oh , but uh we don't have time . ; Sure .
Bsr001_244	aa	so the ; Yeah . ; So , ; Yes ,
Bro012_563	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; And so .
Bmr009_879	%--	Seat and Session . ; " For official use only " ; That 's Well , he 's very professional . ; " use only "
Bmr010_988	%--	and , you know , the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back ; so these th sort of calibration issues . ; And then , um , I just set them loose ; and they 're
Bed008_1248	%--	These are all like saying EV or A , ; right ? ; So it 's not just a generalized situation like ; I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of
Bro024_580	b	Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . ; Like for clean clean training condition . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1174	s	The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , ; uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . ; Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . ; Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .
Bed011_399	s	OK . ; so s ; Alright . ; So we 'll buy a disk .
Bed016_326	s	Whatever . ; OK . ; Um , and that 's ; now I 'm not going to bring that .
Bro027_588	%--	Some of this is , uh is , uh is in parallel , isn't it ? ; I mean , the LDA ; Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D - uh , VAD ? ; Or
Bmr006_1634	d	Is it Yen - Ching ? ; Is that how you pronounce her name ? ; Uh Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah . ; Oh , uh Yu - Ching ?
Bro028_933	s	So , why don't we just , uh , um ; I think starting starting a w couple weeks from now , especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while , we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory . ; But , uh , uh , uh , ; n not not so much in this meeting about Aurora ,
Bmr005_1299	%--	right ? ; If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ ; I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , ; but I think if it 's a real
Bed008_993	aa	and discourse is something that sort of ; should we make a Keith note here ? ; That sort of comes from Keith . ; Sure .
Bsr001_539	b	It 's funny , I li I kind of like this . ; So it actually gets most of its strength from from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear . ; Oh , this would drive me crazy . ; Mmm .
Bro010_680	%--	I think ; Yeah . ; Well , in in the paper he showed that actually the estimation of the noise is is delayed . ; Well , it 's there is
Bed009_620	bk	Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ? ; No , ; no he 's completely gonna rewrite everything . In Java . ; OK .
Bro017_713	s	So for each uh set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ? ; Yeah . ; But but wait a minute . ; You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model .
Bns002_649	b	But this this this is not our scenario . ; OK . ; In our scenario , all the nodes are exactly the same . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_736	s	Yeah . ; And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . ; So that 's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing . ; Uh , so so I think that 's kind of nice to keep " focus " being an information structure term .
Bmr028_873	b	Cuz you have scores for that for the other case . ; Right . ; Right . Exactly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_798	b	Yeah . ; I mean , we should have put an example of this ; and we could do that later . ; Yeah .
Bro023_992	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , um , is to to put some smoothing ,
Bed003_1668	s	Ah , interesting . ; Why does SmartKom need a network ? ; Um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a DHCP request , ; so it you know , my computer does not know its IP address ,
Bed013_1429	s	Remember this , we can completely change the set - up any time we want . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; Look at the results we 've gotten so far for the first , whatever , fifty some subjects ?
Bro004_1124	b	Mm - hmm . ; And so um , basically they 're trying to find stretches . ; The median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1617	s	Well , you can , but you 'll lose a lot of data . ; But ; Yeah . ; But , I mean , that doesn't really help
Bmr021_709	s	and and Chuck wrote this really nice little script Perl script that takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c so - called uh cepstra file , ; which is what the SRI system uses to read features . ; It 's essentially uh uh NIST headered uh waveform . ; You know , it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header .
Btr001_2051	s	That was Liz 's idea . ; Yeah . ; What would be the point of that ? ; Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback .
Bro003_1368	bk	It 's not hand ; it 's not labels by hand . ; Oh , ; " l labeled " .
Bro024_1611	s	OK . ; Well , ; um , ; for Italian and Spanish it 's th this value works good but not necessarily for Finnish .
Bro019_256	s	Yeah , ; there are um ; Right . ; So some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called " no evict " .
Bro014_872	s	for ; th Yeah . ; But if we look at it in one sentence , it apparently it 's good , ; I think .
Bns002_652	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; They they have the same uh signal uh behavior . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1680	b	Oh , that 's really interesting . ; And just combining just doing multis ; We 're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this , um , endpointing stuff . ; Hmm .
Bed016_485	b	and ; the ; the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , ; yeah .
Bro018_198	s	Anyway . ; It 's just a thought . ; How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ? ; Oh , not too much .
Btr002_1553	ba	Yeah . ; Now I know what you 're talking about . ; Yeah . ; That 's kind of interesting , though .
Bmr022_151	s	Individual channels . ; Or they 're indivi ; If it 's individual , um y c we can probably run a forced alignment , ; where you c include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are .
Bmr020_1353	2	Blech . ; That 's interesting ! ; Cuz that 's that 's directly related to the e end task . ; Stress test .
Bro023_1726	s	so Um , ; the c the current VAD that we have was trained on , uh , t SPINE , right ? ; Italian , and TI - digits with noise and ; TI - digits .
Bmr021_559	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; And so ; I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out ,
Bro021_469	h	Mmm . ; Do you have anything , Morgan , ; or ? ; Uh ,
Btr002_682	2	yes , it was prior to the wireless . ; There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless , ; which was , um , mechanically bad in some some sense , ; Loose .
Bro012_66	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D ; A mike for . uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes
Bro012_133	s	And if you look at ; You could just you could just throw up , you know , uh the uh some MFCC feature vectors . ; You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are . ; Right . Well , that 's why I saying
Bed005_1477	b	The little note I sent said that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It said , " Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_683	bk	So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction . ; O oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; I see ,
Bmr029_90	%--	Right ? ; Whatever comparison we w w one would presume . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we don't know how much worse ,
Bmr007_954	bc	With the what file ? ; uh With a m mixed file , ; with a the mix , mix . ; " Mixed . "
Bmr019_1948	bk	so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings . ; The grouping . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns003_544	b	" Last updated " , ; yeah . ; I don't know how we deal with that . ; Yep .
Btr001_2086	s	Oh , wow . ; Oh . ; But then ; I would just be so worried that someone would cheat .
Bmr024_821	s	And everything else was sorta committed . ; Uh ; Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ? ; Those were non - backed - up .
Bsr001_811	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , ; you want to know .
Bro025_245	s	Yeah . ; And all the speech pauses , ; Uh - huh . ; which is Sometimes on the SpeechDat - Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds .
Bro024_509	b	If you have clean training , you get also a fifty percent improvement . ; Yeah . ; But if you have muddy condition training you get only twenty percent . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_428	s	small and big , ; Mm - hmm . ; and this time they came up with a middle one , ; so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big .
Btr002_2125	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah ! ; Like I just , uh , I g
Bro010_539	s	actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , ; was to , uh , take some period of of of speech and in each band , uh , develop a histogram . ; So , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really . ; But , uh I mean you can do it with a smaller amount
Bro027_1925	no	Around five percent better , I guess . ; If if i ; y Like sixty ? ; Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet .
Bed009_500	aa	because it does have to keep track of you ; we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth ; Yeah , th there there I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters . ; Right .
Btr002_764	%--	I think so too . ; Hmm . ; So . ; Yeah , I
Bmr016_2111	b	So I 'd so " I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five " . ; And and actually , you know the language ; it 's the same point , actually , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1375	s	Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? ; So . ; So I actually wrote to him and he answered , " great , that sounds really interesting " . ; But I never heard back
Bmr001_59	s	It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out . ; This is at the middle of the table ; This further down the table . ; And this this one is right at the end of the table ,
Bmr024_798	t3	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; I dunno if you want that .
Bmr030_399	s	And then we can give those to IBM ; and it 'll make it easier for them to put them on tape . ; Um , then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they 're using , um , sort of are not dedicated to to our project , ; but are in use for all IBM projects ,
Bmr013_362	aa	So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . ; Right . ; That 's all , I mean . ; Exactly .
Bns001_1369	s	Now , that 's the point why I am focussing on more on the ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; I want to have really the activities
Bed009_118	bk	Um we 're here through Sunday , ; Oh ; so ; Oh , OK ,
Bed005_887	b	Mm - hmm . ; In order to e do sensible information extraction . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_67	s	Yeah . Yeah . ; Yes . ; So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much uh uh much smaller ; It 's out of the way .
Bmr018_805	%--	It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people , ; Right . ; and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that . ; So so I guess that 's sort of a last
Bsr001_553	s	When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one . ; Uh Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I really liked it
Bns002_525	b	Mm - hmm . ; So this node is W won't be sending the eh eh CTS packet to the transmitter . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_592	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Do you ; The the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I I I want to use to to nnn , eh to put
Bro022_727	aa	I mean ; Mm - hmm . ; Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh you 're also training on all the data . ; That 's right .
Bmr016_1679	%--	Was that somewhere where they were gonna say " new speaker " or something ? ; No , I looked for that , ; but that doesn't actually exist . ; And it may be ,
Bro022_156	b	A few more . ; It 's about a month from now ? ; It 's a it 's a month and and a week . ; Yeah .
Bro017_910	s	Uh - huh . ; And now you 're you 're you 're changing that by squaring it . ; Now your mean of your C - one original data has is four . ; But your model still has a mean of two .
Bmr016_202	qrr	OK . ; and ; I mean what do other people think ; Or is that alright ?
Bro004_112	qw	So how ; I mean clearly it 's gonna be good then ; So what 's th ; but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ?
Bmr009_1178	s	Yeah , w It 's In It 's it 's harder in America anywhere else , basically . ; We don't know . ; because you have ; I mean some of them are very obvious .
Bro024_146	ba	Um , ; but , u uh , ; yes . ; No , it is interesting .
Bed014_933	s	Well p ; people people differ in their tastes in this matter . ; Yeah . ; I I 'm neutral .
Bed004_156	s	Really ? ; No . ; She she jumped around quite a bit . ; Oh , it 's surprising .
Btr002_3005	b	They do this sound , ; and then there 's a pause , ; and then they start speaking , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_535	b	OK . ; It can be delay on the disk , ; or it can be just load gets high on the machine . ; Yeah .
Bro022_609	s	For with the SRI system ; Mm - hmm . ; Well . ; You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter ,
Bed016_359	%--	Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , ; OK ? ; Yeah . ; which ,
Bmr008_974	ba	How b How About " How long have you been uh in in an English speaking country ? " ; Yeah , that 's a good one . ; Yeah . ; That 'd be OK .
Bns002_113	bk	That 's perfect , you know . ; Yeah . ; This in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway , from this network to connect to other networks , ; Right .
Buw001_1841	b	as to ; we should talk about it , ; but ; Mmm .
Bed015_1321	b	even though saying that place takes place , whatever . ; Uh , if y if I said " time " is , you know , " past " , that would say " set that this world " , you know , " somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_243	%--	That 's pretty big , though . ; As far as ; That 's @ @ That 's big . ; Actually
Bmr010_195	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; that you 'll have plenty of s sections that are ; Yeah .
Bro017_1264	s	and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and so I think it this is available .
Bed012_125	%--	though yeah . ; OK . ; And , um , ; the reason is why I think it 's a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is
Bed003_390	2	Navigational landmarks , ; Navigational cue . ; yeah . ; navigational landmarks
Bmr013_175	b	Right . ; and we 're we 're in there somewhere . ; But that I mean it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , I mean , every everything is good . ; Yeah .
Bro017_271	s	Hmm . ; You know , ; on on like for the frame by frame basis , ; so uh uh so it 's much better than chance .
Bmr013_118	ba	So , that 's that 's an indication , ; uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , ; so . More typical numbers like ; Although the models weren't , that good ,
Bmr020_82	s	so the only agenda items were Jane was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM transcription process . ; There 's an agenda ? ; I sort of condensed the three things you said into that . ; And then just I only have like , this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before I go to Japan for ten days .
Bro021_413	b	Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter . ; So ; It 's something that 's also short enough in in latency . ; Yeah .
Bed010_189	bk	but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Got it .
Bmr008_1754	s	Yes , this is this is it 's incredible . ; Huh . ; Hmm ! ; I I I do the same in in another in another way
Bmr003_1794	s	Yeah , it took me half an hour to transcribe a minute , ; but I didn't have any I didn't even have a ; OK . ; I was trying to get Transcriber to run but I couldn't .
Bed004_780	%--	um ; Maybe we sho ; should we a add then the " what 's this ? " domain ? ; N
Bmr026_32	ar	So we 're doing some in parallel . ; So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM ; Yep . ; No .
Bmr024_420	%	So this is just partly to inform everybody , um , and and of course to get , um , input . ; Oops . ; Um , so , uh , we had a discussion Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with Don 's work , ; Ch
Bro023_1343	aa	it ; It 's around three percent , um , relative . ; Worse . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_1159	aa	So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those . ; Do y ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm , uh Exactly . Exactly .
Bmr020_350	bk	So , we scored all the recognition results , uh , in such a way that the ; uh ; Oh by the way , who 's on channel four ? ; Yeah .
Bro011_277	%--	Great . ; Great . ; Yeah actually um he should uh ; I wonder who else is
Btr002_2816	%--	So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . One thing that I noticed
Bns002_38	ft	OK . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Thank - thank you .
Bmr022_436	aa	And then also , if we I mean , I don't know what their setup is , but your template idea might be a way of of of ; Mm - hmm . ; We could actually build the numbers into a template . ; Yep .
Bmr021_492	s	That data never gets touched , ; Well , why not ? ; because we write it once and then we never touch it again . ; Oh sure it does .
Btr002_2106	b	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , that 's funny . ; Um , not a te not a bad intrusion , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_444	s	Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now , ; Mm - hmm . ; and what I was told is that beginning , ; you know , that the the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh or f you know half hour to forty minutes of running text .
Bed014_575	s	and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts ; and feed those through the dialogue history ; and check dynamically ; for each e entity . We look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side .
Bed015_1169	s	And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic ; like " source , path , goal " is often thought of that way ; or " force " , or something like that . ; But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that .
Bsr001_1010	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_1374	%--	Yeah , but I 'm not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the s detector I I I used up to now , ; Uh ; Mm - hmm . ; the to speech - nonspeech as
Bmr020_562	s	Right . ; Right . ; but then Chuck came in ; and so you paused for a second
Bmr003_785	ba	couldn't we Dan ? ; Yeah , mis Mister TCL ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , interesting point .
Bro024_679	s	i It is well known , this this medium match condition of the Finnish data has some strange effects . ; Very s ; Yeah . ; It has a very few at uh , actually , c uh , tran I mean , words also .
Bro016_128	s	Also , eh , eh , sometimes if you run behind on some of these things , maybe we can get someone else to do it ; and you can supervise or something . ; But ; but I think it would be it 'd be good to know that .
Bmr006_408	aa	Yeah ; Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered . ; Should I pursue that ? ; Oh , definitely , yeah .
Buw001_1278	aa	Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done ; I mean , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . ; But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and generate some queries . ; Yeah .
Bro022_91	%--	Oh . ; Uh , a little bit about ? ; Mmm . ; Wh - what you 're what you 're gonna
Bmr021_849	aa	I mean the ; Anyway . But I can certainly try the SRI front - end without uh VTL . ; That sh that 's that 's certainly quick to do . ; Yeah .
Bro026_85	aa	So w when you came in from Belgian Belgium , using SSH , uh , was it asking you for your own password into ICSI ? ; So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ? ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2260	h	So what 's the schedule on these things ? ; Wow . ; But , you always ; Uh ,
Bmr020_1864	ba	Yeah . ; OK , ; Cuz , I wouldn't don't think we would mind having that transcribed , if they did it . ; excellent .
Bmr023_118	b	Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience . ; Greek chorus . ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr009_80	%--	Oh . ; And so you take that . ; And then he 's he 's uh measuring at the frame level ; still at the frame level , of what
Bmr015_432	s	If we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to , ; what would we be doing with it ? ; Uh . ; Exactly what we say in the proposal .
Bro011_649	x	Mm - hmm . ; Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , ; but just sort of eh you know you t you i z ; Yeah .
Bmr023_952	bd	It 's called , uh , H - HPF . ; H ; Yeah . Does HPF on on his feat feature . ; u And but HPF , you know , when you put a number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off .
Bro003_1254	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So you could be ; we have quite a few SPERT boards .
Btr001_2195	co	Mm - hmm . ; I think it 's sort of a like you guys can take from here , ; you know , ; somebody somebody build on my thought .
Bed002_1316	ba	Probably neither e not even that . ; Yeah . ; Clear ? ; OK . Sounds good .
Bmr027_847	aa	You might as well just respond to the mail . ; And ; And we actually need a third thing . ; Right .
Bed015_285	no	so it 's not clear that , ; uh ; Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . ; So I don't know what a form type is .
Bed012_609	s	and he won't be here . ; And what 's Nancy doing ? ; Nancy ? ; Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades ,
Btr002_705	%	Yeah , ; It 's like ; Yeah . ; and like not listen to them .
Bmr024_512	aa	Yeah . ; do those actually go down or not ? ; Because of ; Yeah .
Bmr008_278	bk	Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse . ; That ; Right . That 's what we 've done so far . ; Right .
Bmr006_622	b	but are we g do we have some other other space now ? ; Yep . ; So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_248	s	Right . ; Right . ; I mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus ; and I think it 's gonna be generally useful .
Bmr026_168	ba	And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , ; and I don't know how much more we can do with it ; with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom ; Oh , cool .
Bmr010_1502	s	uh , the has has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue ; and , ; um , ; as with a lot of things , it is not uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds .
Bmr003_796	bk	But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID . ; but it does take twice . ; I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change . ; Yeah , yeah ,
Bed014_1307	s	OK , which was that o one of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called " Towards a formal cognitive semantics " ; which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all . ; Yeah . ; So it could be that he 's actually , at some level , thinking about how am I going to communicate this story
Bmr005_1172	%--	we have ; It 's three to four per week . ; So that 's what You know , that ; uh eight weeks , uh is
Bmr019_1354	b	and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May or something to turn in their paper . ; Oh . ; Mmm . ; Oh .
Btr001_2132	bk	Yes . ; Um , ; as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out . ; Yes .
Bmr014_596	b	Yeah . ; No . ; Uh , I mmm , use some some different features but not not ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_552	aa	There 's ; I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . ; Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_749	s	Yeah . ; and Um ; It 'd be worth a try . ; It would be interesting to see what we get .
Bns001_1275	s	And then this mechanism must fit it there . ; But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success , ; impossible to change . ; You see the difficulties with IP version six ,
Bed004_255	s	Yeah she she didn't explicitly state that ; so . ; Great . ; And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people .
Bro012_590	s	yeah . ; Yeah . ; Sounds like a great idea ; but but I think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline .
Bed005_553	aa	Great . ; So this is just trying to ; It 's a design thing , not a political thing . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1125	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that that you want to constant draw from from sub - tasks um that are relevant ; M Th
Bmr006_1483	bk	We still have to do this , too , right ? ; Right . ; Digits ? ; Right .
Bro019_1653	bk	and then back in a week I guess , ; and . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_671	aa	Does and that does that mean , I ; maybe I should know this but I don't . ; Does this mean that the that this could be por uh ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of uh ; Yeah , basically uh I did install it on my laptop
Bro025_271	s	Yeah . ; And another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let 's say , for SpeechDat - Car . ; We have channel zero which is clean , ; channel one which is far - field microphone .
Bed015_1978	aa	Um , ; like constructions can inherit from other things , ; am I right ? ; yeah .
Bdb001_850	bd	Mm - hmm . ; It seems like the kind of thing you 'd do if I don't know , if people start adding all kinds of s bells and whistles to the data . ; And so that might be ; I mean , it 'd be good for us to know to use a format where we know we can easily , um , input that to some database if other people are using it .
Bed015_1697	%	Ties it all into it . ; it it ties together several of of these things . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bro019_1614	s	I bet it it might have may have been ; I d d this ; but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ? ; In in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well .
Bed012_472	b	But ; It 's through the ; So th s so , yeah , but some So , some things would drop out , and some things would still be important . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_1056	b	How ; Idle time . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_806	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; and you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done . ; And I was asking if you were going to do redo it uh for PLP with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum .
Bmr006_1620	aa	They won't be able to change it themselves . ; What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? ; Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . ; Yeah , really .
Bmr016_1152	s	w And that that 's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled . ; So for things like " and " , the fact that someone doesn't say the " D " , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription ; because a a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . ; However , things like " cuz " where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable ,
Bro019_131	s	You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , ; all the way down to an individual machine . ; Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . ; So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that .
Bns002_577	s	yeah ; but the but in this case , you know this this idea , this uh geometric idea , can be can be , if you want , uh deformed because of some obstacles . ; OK ? ; But this wall is working both ways .
Bro026_247	bk	The the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bed002_410	s	that the person wants to uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . ; Um . ; So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . ; And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things .
Bmr025_394	s	Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers ; so I mean , you know , ; to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . ; I mean it 's different .
Bns003_928	s	there 's some linkage ; and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area , uh , with the supported , um , home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area . ; The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one . ; But , you see the question is always " Where 's the money ? "
Bro003_385	%--	Yeah . ; Now , can you include , uh , the the target language ? ; Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to ; because then you can say when
Bns001_1809	s	now let me see whether he will be here , ; and ; We did not forget . ; We are done .
Bmr024_309	bk	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's great . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1784	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Oh , yeah . ; Mmm .
Bed013_1396	%	Yeah . ; All others are useless . ; Yeah . ; That 's good .
Bro003_458	g	Hmm . ; Yeah , but your initial things you 're making one choice there , ; Yeah , ; right ?
Bro024_1268	aa	Uh , it 's Italian TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; Oh , it 's trained on Italian ? ; Yeah .
Bro028_219	bd	Mm - hmm . ; That 's a good point . ; Mmm . ; Uh . Well , there are other things that we should do
Bed002_746	s	Mm - hmm . ; If they 're doing it in a ; you know , " I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions " , ; I I would imagine that the data would be really different .
Bmr024_355	s	Right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So that 's just my question .
Bro013_741	s	if we want to the the guy to say " O " ; or ; No . ; I mean . I think people will do what they say .
Bmr016_1973	qw	" gloss one one one dash one three zero " . ; Right . ; Well now ; What what 's to the left of that ?
Bmr014_1137	s	I also have this ; I I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , ; I mean I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , ; and but I I think it 's nice that a person could check .
Btr002_1617	bk	Yeah , in the very beginning . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr005_269	b	but ; It 's not a meeting . ; Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if if we weren't being recorded . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_961	b	so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , ; Mm - hmm . ; which is another old old bug of mine . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1077	aa	And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . ; I see . ; But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle . ; Yep .
Buw001_152	s	I 'm on channel three . ; And I 'm Adam Janin on channel A . ; I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B . ; I 'm Dan Ellis .
Bed015_613	aa	Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , I mean ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah .
Bed015_791	ba	but it 's most I think it 's this is , you know , the current current form . ; Other things we didn't totally deal with , um , ; well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . ; Oh , there 's a bunch .
Bro021_1182	b	That mean that the VTS mmm , with the VTS we obtain , ; uh ; well , we we obtain the means for each Gaussian and the variance . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1214	s	Well yeah , but you can't dep ; I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . ; Yeah , OK , fair enough . ; And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves .
Bmr011_1264	b	I mean , actually if we get into that it might be good to , uh , uh , haul John Ohala into this ; OK . ; and ask his his views on it I think . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_630	s	Um , ; so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes for the head m head - worn ones ; cuz they 're so uncomfortable . ; But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do ,
Bns002_1304	s	Yeah , and this is this is eh within maybe an uh wireless LAN . ; Will be . ; So , despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still ; In fact in fact Bluetooth is also designed
Btr002_2835	b	and that would kind of i imply uncomfortability , or something . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_626	bk	A bug is what I mean , ; so that it 's like ; Oh , OK . ; I see .
Bmr016_75	qh	So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings . ; The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits . ; When I look at this , that first line is " sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . " ; Um , and so the question is does anyone care ?
Bns001_1788	s	That 's a ramp . ; And we can go in different directions . ; And if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or UMTS or whatever , great . ; If not , the long term and then these things must be , nevertheless must be defined in much more detail .
Bmr005_442	aa	yeah , ; So again , that 's that 's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers , just speakers . ; for forty - five minutes . ; Yeah ?
Bed016_610	s	This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; The b the the double arrow .
Bro027_370	bk	Because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for Linux and all those . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro018_652	b	You have the distances to work with , ; Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1465	s	it would be underneath that little resolution bar ? ; I mean , it 's like in that u cluster up there ? ; Um , it 's not on the resolution part . ; It 's where you have it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting .
Bro004_592	s	No . ; Can I ask something real quick ? ; In in the upper part in the English stuff , it looks like the very best number is sixty point nine ? ; and that 's in the uh the third section in the upper part under PLP JRASTA ,
Bed002_166	s	Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings ; to give ourselves something easier . ; And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , ; which is a common connected digits corpus .
Bdb001_709	s	So so what you would end up having is a tag saying " here 's a word , ; and it starts here and it ends here " . ; Right . ; And then lower down you would say " here 's a prosodic boundary
Bed010_251	b	But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where ; Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , ; what 's the ontology look like , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_671	b	Yeah . ; And we 'll also as y as you 'll s further along we 'll get into business about " Well , you 're you know this is going over a meal time , ; do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? " ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_627	s	Well actually you have only have two choices . ; You can either do a two - point or a three - point ; which is you You 're familiar with th with the " origo " ? ; where that 's the center " Origo " is the center of the f frame of reference .
Bed006_1277	fa	That 's like ; th this is this r ; OK , ; sorry .
Bmr026_410	bk	X G ? ; XG . ; XG . ; OK .
Bns002_961	aa	Can take place at the same time . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; So you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range . ; Yeah .
Bro023_99	s	In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . ; And , um , ; here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds ; but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .
Bmr024_1398	s	And for the in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one . ; And what 's the top frequency of each ? ; Well , now it 's the same . ; It 's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz .
Bro022_344	bk	OK . ; So it might be just some ; So I should maybe listen to that stuff again . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_653	bk	Sure . ; we talked out about what we 're ; Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is what is what eh OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we 're in a situation where we can with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording . ; OK .
Bro013_250	b	Mm - hmm . ; It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all . ; Well . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_659	s	Yeah . ; But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right ; you won't even ; Yeah , This is the This is the the idea , to consider only the the small window near near near the the overlapping zone .
Bro007_190	s	so s ; and little worse on the mis on the MM case , ; but ; uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things
Bro019_1110	%--	but ; uh , yeah . ; But , you 're right ; that that that 's a real good point , that uh , we we don't know yeah , uh , I mean , what if any of these ta
Bro007_21	aa	so ; yeah I could perhaps draw this on the blackboard ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Bed011_465	%--	You could , ; but i but I I I think in the short run , ; And ; no , th the per
Bsr001_2515	b	Right . ; I guess we could write them down and then read them , ; but . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1039	aa	I just don't have time to do it now . ; I was these meetings I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation . ; So ; Yep . Yep .
Bmr011_271	b	so we all have big heads . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed002_665	s	OK . ; So ; Not from that data . ; But , um , since we are designing a a a an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,
Bmr011_1452	s	But they have several smaller meetings a week , ; So . ; and , uh , the notion was raised before that that could happen . ; And it just , you know it just didn't come together
Btr002_1626	s	I don't I don't wanna cause any partisanship here , ; but ; Wait , a favorite what ? ; A a fav a favorite t type of meeting that you like ,
Bmr014_298	%--	OK . ; Uh , is Dave ; I don't know if Dave is on the list , ; if he 's invited to these meetings ,
Bed013_1064	qw	So we need to find out what the " where is X " construction will give us in terms of semantics ; and Simspec type things . ; Just ; OK . Just " where is X " ?
Bmr008_431	b	I like it . ; I think it 's softening . ; I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's an important point the other way ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1110	s	No . ; It 's too much ? ; Yeah . ; Well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT ,
Bmr005_662	aa	So my my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , beginning and end point . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1223	s	and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . ; Of , ; uh , you know , get a t a p tentative format for it , ; let 's say XML , that says , l you know , " These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . "
Bro027_877	s	So ; And from the other side it 's forty - five . ; So , d i It 's forty - five . ; So it 's you have seventy - three features ,
Bmr022_768	ba	So what I was thinking is , we could get a few more of the Sony ones ; and just unplug them and plug them in . ; And the only thing is that when you fill out the digit forms , you have to be sure to indicate which mike was actually used . ; So , I mean , that 's easy to do .
Bmr024_266	b	Yeah , I mean , I guess the So the difference if if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ? ; Got a good core group now . ; Again . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2564	b	you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro012_923	s	So . ; Well . It 's just to ; Yeah . ; the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM with these two kinds of parameters .
Bed002_882	b	Yeah , and and we will record both sides . ; I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard ; Uh - huh . ; Uh - huh .
Bro017_603	h	You can remove it from the vector , it doesn't hurt . ; Really ? ! ; That has no effect ? ; Um .
Bmr023_337	bd	so it makes sense . ; Uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . ; We 're really lucky the two that we kept . ; And , um Well , I don't mean I don't mean anything against the others . What I mean is we 've got a good cause a good core . No . We had a good core
Bro017_289	s	It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , time t ; Yeah but what 's the number ? ; Is it just the ; It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy ,
Bmr020_1821	b	But but if if out of context , they can't tell if it 's a channeled speak uh , you know , a close - miked speaker or not , then that would be confusing to them . ; OK . ; Right . ; OK .
Bro012_293	b	And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed006_941	s	Then we have real means of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our elements here ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and link it to another one , and this not only within a document but also via documents ,
Bmr005_138	x	but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in in in this stuff . ; So . ; And I imagine that transcripts of speech I mean text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . ; I I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .
Bmr016_744	bk	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits , ; so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on . ; Oh right .
Bed002_426	s	And , if things are obviously closed , then , you ; People won't want to enter it . ; Pe - people don't wanna enter them . ; And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .
Bro028_887	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; whether it was some , uh , on - line thing , or whether it was a second pass , or what . ; But but they That that was sort of the idea .
Bmr014_745	s	Yeah . ; I guess ; Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . ; I guess an email OK is alright .
Bro016_97	%--	But it is interesting . ; You say you you have for the noisy ; How about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions ? ; Have you ?
Buw001_101	%--	getting people to do summaries afterwards . ; Um . ; Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , um , ; i uh , if he I , um
Bns001_1773	s	So it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when I am leaving ; and if I stay longer of course we can go on ; but nevertheless I rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody , ; and it 's in their own interest
Bed015_1675	s	it 'll be one or the other . ; Yeah . ; It 's like , oh , actually , it 's the same same operation . ; Oh , OK , so this this is worth some thought .
Buw001_1725	s	So , sure . ; OK . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , ; I need to email him , uh , my shipping address ; and you need to email them something which you already did .
Bmr008_1236	s	Interesting . Good . ; And systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful . ; Nope . ; Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise ,
Bmr023_1115	b	So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1269	b	Yeah , ; I agree . ; just for sort of diversity , ; Yeah .
Bmr008_207	ba	How about Yeah , how about Post - PHD researcher or something ; So if if we can put something ; and Or maybe Post - doc change " Post - doc " to " PHD " ? ; Yeah , that then then I think what you have is great .
Bed003_1432	s	huh ? ; just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , ; you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . ; It 's amazing what human beings can do .
Bro017_1002	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then do a whole bunch of those . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1672	s	In in our phone call , uh , before , we we , uh It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , uh , ; And then ; And , uh ; and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape
Bmr008_271	%--	I think it 's fine . ; So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler ; even though I know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who 's doing research in in this area ; I uh The the the thing making me lean toward simpler where possible is that uh the more a thing
Btr002_874	bk	What do you mean by " expand " ? ; Oh , uh , in terms of , um , if , uh if it 's it 's if it 's cut off , ; like the beginning of an utterance , ; OK .
Bro028_544	s	Correct ? ; And the baseline , eh ; Accuracy ? ; Uh , error rate .
Bro008_481	s	well ; Actually , this is tha that 's why we ; well , it 's a different kind of data . ; We 're not we 're not used to work with this kind of data .
Bro007_125	s	So filt is what that is ? ; Filt , yeah ; Yeah . ; Um yeah so it seems f for the the well match and mismatched condition
Btr002_2500	s	Right . ; and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like ; I don't know , like , um Hhh . ; I would say " tongue click " for that .
Bmr015_867	%--	in in , uh , ; what domain ? ; I mean this is this is in in in in bands ? ; Or or
Bmr016_847	%--	Oh I see . ; OK . ; Alright , I did know that . ; Um , so the the only question is how much of it
Bmr016_1001	s	but . ; Yeah and they don't . ; Two gig ? ; So we 're also looking at these in Waves like for the alignments and so forth .
Bro017_268	b	Hmm . ; Because if you run this uh recognition , you get you still get about twenty percent error ; uh twenty percent correct . ; Hmm .
Bsr001_1939	bk	So it 's it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task . ; Oh , I I uh ; sure , sure , sure , sure . ; I see .
Btr002_154	b	Hmm . ; I wanted to bring an example where th ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bns003_547	s	Yep . ; Is it another thing we have to ? ; Yep . ; So it 's just a su suggestion
Buw001_1166	aa	Um , what what 's the plan for this discussion ? ; We should ; Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , ; At least . Yeah .
Bmr016_1947	s	Um , now th Then I have these numbers that have quotation marks around them . ; Um , I didn't want to put them in as gloss comments ; because then you get the substitution . ; And actually , th um , the reason I b did it this way was because I initially started out with the other version ,
Bro003_1934	b	Fact , most confusions are within the phone phone classes , right ? ; I think , uh , Larry was saying like obstruents are only confused with other obstruents , et cetera , et cetera . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_752	s	yeah . ; Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms . ; RSMP . ; Yeah , I don't really .
Bed016_652	s	there are idioms ; and my guess is that 's one of them , ; but , um I don't know . ; All contact .
Btr001_872	b	i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes ; and I 've run across that also . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_756	s	I see . ; We had we had initially we 'd started discussing the " out of film . " ; Right . ; And there 's a lot of " out of " analysis ,
Bmr025_793	s	Yeah . ; How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? ; so . ; I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally
Bns001_1010	s	but that 's all what 's uh ; It 's not IP at all . ; Right . ; Because there is a gateway , you can access with almost the same microbrowser ,
Bmr031_827	bk	or completed transcription , ; and it also includes , uh , checked . ; So it includes a lot of categories together . ; I see .
Bro004_688	s	Right . ; Right . ; And Pratibha did something different is ; that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance .
Bed014_674	bk	Yeah . ; Well , and and and the simple idea is that it 's on it 's only for m for the current uh , tourist e entity of instre interest . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1055	s	Amaretto ? ; Amaretto . ; OK . ; Amaretto has a different one .
Bed006_1081	s	you know from the other ; But you know that 's just That 's just me . ; Like I I ; Well , I think we 're gonna hit a lot of interesting problems
Bmr003_1092	b	They w they 'll refuse to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; We 'll have to mix them . ; Right .
Bed015_1856	aa	i isn't that part easy though ; because in terms of the s simspec , it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it , ; and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony ; Yeah .
Bed015_1457	s	So and , um , ; Mats Gould . ; And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart . ; So he 's not there anymore .
Bro007_559	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; The fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising ; most improvements aren't enormous
Bed015_352	bk	I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of of phrase structure . ; Right . ; But , uh , ; Right .
Bro027_367	s	So this is now it 's it 's compiled under Solaris ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; Because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for Linux and all those .
Bmr027_1345	ba	Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . ; But of course the fiscal year starts in October , ; so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July . ; She 's either really late or really early .
Bmr011_1169	s	I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , ; uh , where we we , ; uh uh , ; we have all the data transcribed
Bro019_1590	b	How did ; But ; But but mostly they are . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1453	%--	Comments . ; you know ; oh , yes , ; there was some
Bmr009_1503	b	It 's really bad . ; It 's So , it it 's the redrawing of the w ; That 's a consideration . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_232	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; and that would help keep them from getting lost . ; And , um , so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps
Bmr026_703	s	I think it must be uh nearing the end of the week . ; Um . Yeah . ; I You know , I I 've heard some comments about like this . ; That m could be .
Bro027_964	b	Um ; Well , we might uh , we might have to experiment with , uh better training sets . ; Again . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_902	s	Brian himself downloaded So So , um , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded ; uh , cuz , you know , I mean , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . ; He downloaded from the CD onto audio tapes . ; And apparently he did it one channel per audio tape .
Bro021_1067	s	I see . ; No ? ; I see . ; OK , I understand now .
Bmr014_1180	s	Mm - hmm . ; but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant . ; I don't know how to notate that . ; Sarcasm ,
Bed013_359	s	Well , um , I don't have much experience with uh , conference papers for compu in the computer science realm , ; and so when I looked at what you had , which was apparently a complete submission , I just sort of said ; what just ; I I didn't really know what to do with it ,
Bro027_1685	%--	Yeah , yeah . ; Right . ; Um ; instead of just h having c uh , those cleaned up t cepstrum , sh should we feed some additional information , like The the
Bsr001_2400	ba	Treat especially ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Cool .
Bmr008_834	s	I mean . What you said . ; you know , " where where wh where did you live ? " , ; or uh , what you were saying , " Languages in the home " . ; But I think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful
Bro028_973	s	but you could using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions ; which have a lot longer time scale ; and , um , some which have a lot shorter , ; and so it would be like a set of multi - scale features .
Btr001_775	%	usually that doesn't happen ; but this time it did . ; So for the non - linguists , what 's a fricative ? ; I
Bns003_538	aa	Yeah but this will be then down on the button of the page anyways . ; Yeah , maybe we can have " updated on " , you know the button itself ? ; So ; Yeah ,
Bdb001_1083	2	So that would be i directly , ; Yep . ; um ; Easy easy to map .
Bmr011_1105	co	We 'll have to talk to Brian . ; um , ; yeah , I 'm sure they will ; and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it .
Bed002_966	s	the The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , ; and set the context , ; and know what language was used . ; So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data .
Bmr028_4	%--	So the only status ite ; well , first of all we h haven't decided whether we 're Meeting Recorder data issues , or recognition this week . ; I think we were recognition . ; Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the
Bmr011_933	b	Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . ; I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . ; And I I mean , I know you . I know what your voice sounds like . I 'm sort of familiar with ; Yeah .
Bmr018_760	s	Well less than a week . ; So um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point . ; Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ? ; Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say .
Bro017_1119	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1347	s	I don't even know how to pronounce that . ; Well , yeah . Now that that s only occurs once , ; Yeah . ; and I 'm thinking of changing that .
Bmr024_166	s	Yeah . ; That 's what I thought . ; so . ; I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio device gets hung for a second ,
Bed002_1187	s	And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . ; Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , ; and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . ; I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site
Bed013_1175	qw	or li characterizing them like that . ; Cuz you don't It seems like in the general case you wouldn't know how how to characterize them . ; You wouldn't . ; I mean or , for when .
Bro008_295	h	I mean , we tried a lot of things in a hurry , ; and , uh , if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something , and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint , what what you think would be the best thing to do . ; Uh , well ; Hmm
Bns001_420	s	That 's the only senseful application . ; From my understanding , that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers , ; which you also mentioned as a USAIA architecture . ; and uh then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh , transparently to this application , between those uh these both technologies .
Bed002_314	qw	First of all , ; very important , ; and um , that I 've completely forgot that when we talked . ; This is of course a crucial factor , " what type of object is it ? "
Bed014_927	s	Whatever . ; No , that 's fine . ; I mean that ; The I 'd like to have them all in one day ,
Buw001_1464	b	And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . ; Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_214	s	Oh , OK interesting . ; That that Right ? that that , um ; Yeah . ; here 's a relatively short meeting ,
Bro003_1788	b	and getting to ninety - four really really hard . ; Mm - hmm . ; Another year . ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_1090	b	I see . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_175	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And now we do . ; So will the neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction ? ; Well , so so so argu arguably , I mean , what we should do
Bmr002_424	bk	I 'm not using them anymore . ; I used to use them . ; So they 're currently set up for Shift , Control , and Alt . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_207	s	That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later . ; Yep . ; And then I wanted to talk about but as I said I we may not have time what we should do about digits . ; We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed .
Bmr026_786	bk	Just with ROVER ? ; t ; With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_668	qw	so . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um ; where did six come from ?
Bro003_836	%--	Sp - Not Spanish stories ? ; No . ; Spanish ; No . Albayz
Bed014_176	s	The the little Smarticus ; Smarticus sounds like a murderer . ; Oh . ; That 's good to know .
Bro011_181	aa	right ? ; And this machines are busy ; and you 're busy ; Yeah .
Bmr013_680	s	With the recognizer ? ; Yeah . ; And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . ; Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine ,
Bed011_161	s	And um I can report a so I did this but I also tried to do this ; so if I click on here , ; Isn't this wonderful ? ; we get to the uh uh belief - net just focusing on on the g Go - there node .
Bro017_1275	cc	Ah yeah . ; because I think he started first just with a plain C C or C - plus - plus or something before ; Mm - hmm . ; I I can check on that .
Bmr011_465	no	I think they are . ; Oh , cuz what what I had read was , uh , they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , ; both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . ; Well , I 'm I 'm I 'm not sure .
Buw001_74	bk	yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . ; Yeah . ; That 's good . ; OK .
Bed005_832	s	Nancy , it looked like you were s ; Oh . it 's just that that the goals are g very different to cases ; So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain , actually , ; was that most of the things we talked about are our story understanding .
Bro024_753	g	Mmm . ; So . ; Yes . ; Stephane also has the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right ?
Bmr016_2006	b	Mm - hmm . ; but ; Good . ; Great .
Bmr031_134	s	What pie chart ? ; Pie ? ; Oh . ; He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page ,
Bmr007_1079	s	" Sorry , I 'm just I 'm just going to sleep . " ; But then there 's just one @ @ , like . ; Yeah . ; Actually , I saw a uh a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone speaking Japanese , and was bowing .
Bed009_764	b	because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere ; OK . ; what 's in the latches from the speech recognizer ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_996	s	So yeah . ; And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address . ; But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all . ; It 's l just a thirty - bit number
Bmr015_86	b	My opinion is , um , we should just throw them out completely , ; and have them read again by someone else . ; You know , the grouping is completely random , ; Uh - huh .
Bro023_222	%--	And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , " excuse me ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; uh , ; or some
Bro004_660	b	So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization ; and straight features to HTK . ; And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK . ; Yes .
Bed012_552	aa	Then you would have to make a decision , ; " OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which decision nodes do I query ? " ; Yeah . So you have to make ; Yeah .
Bns001_639	s	But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind . ; I see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of UMTS know how . ; Mm - hmm . ; And you need it definitely
Bmr019_504	s	which is which is , you know , a ; But but but how did we get the how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ? ; In the H L T paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned , ; which is now h being changed in the transcription process ,
Bro018_978	b	and compare that directly to ; Well , it 's not precisely . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed005_1378	s	This is with the whole thing , ; we may have to build another data stru ; Yep . ; Conceptually , we know what should be done .
Bro004_562	aa	oh I well , wait a minute . ; You have this here , for the Italian . ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_276	b	Right . ; The ; It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution . ; Right .
Bns002_1097	s	Mm - hmm . ; Maybe two - B or three - B ; Yeah , but nevertheless this guy is a is an gateway in the router for for this packet , you know . ; And they remove itself from the header .
Bsr001_712	s	the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not . ; I mean , our approach , somehow , I mean , I believe it 's probably , you know , complimentary in many ways , is to focus on the actual deep technology that we have somehow in speech . And basically , make progress on , you know , the algorithms . ; Right . ; And then , you know , it will run somewhere .
Bmr029_106	qw	Yeah , but we also have to do this other processing , so having a smaller training set , ; if it 's only a few percent difference , it might be be worth doing it . ; Oh , I see . ; But - m How big is the small training set ?
Bns001_1108	aa	Sure . ; But usually that 's not the reason to have UMTS . ; No , not not if you have a big uh web pad or something . ; Yep .
Bmr010_1433	bk	OK . ; And so those are the putative places where he tries . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_210	b	They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . ; Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , ; and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1243	s	He ; Yeah . ; Well , he can y y ; Well , Dan 's got an open notebook , too .
Bmr003_1495	s	Huge amounts . ; It was at the beginning . ; Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things . ; But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap
Bro010_392	b	Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . ; And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . ; And if the neural net is better than this ; Hmm .
Bmr024_612	aa	The English system ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr018_1074	b	If you ; And that we know , I mean , we have that . ; And it 's about roughly two - thirds , I mean , very roughly averaged . ; Yeah .
Bro014_592	%--	but this e ; Well , for the baseline . ; Yeah . ; So so if you use other features then y
Bns001_1501	bk	And it 's more related I believe to the skills ; to what is available ; and and currently as I see what uh will be available within the NSA group . ; OK .
Bed013_133	%--	What it would be the the prior intention . ; So let 's uh uh , let 's say we have this ; Well we 'd have to seed that , ; I mean .
Bmr020_651	s	It 's a very ; Oh ! ; So , exactly what you describe , ; but for Japanese .
Bed017_427	s	basically giving this um Uh ; so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , ; and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again . ; And , using this and some some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some some simple inferences .
Bro021_1345	s	Yeah . It 's quite complicated . ; Yeah , OK . ; No , I won't ask the next question then . ; Oh , it 's it 's the for me it 's the first time that I am working with VTS .
Buw001_1854	no	but a at least it 's worth trying . ; Mm - hmm . ; What is it ? ; We don't know .
Bmr013_97	b	Oh , OK . ; Um , it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . ; But , either way . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1248	s	And , um , did you I thought you might have done that , Joel . ; Did you also ? ; Nn - nnn . No . ; So , two people did that , i um , I thought .
Bmr007_574	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , I mean you could do that . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1455	s	Yeah . They can still check it out ; Yeah , cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies . ; Right . ; And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all .
Bro024_992	s	So the fifty - one point O nine has become forty - eight point O six , ; which is like three percent relative degradation . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I have like the fifty - one point O nine
Bdb001_1094	bk	Yeah , ; any kind of annotation that , like , isn't already there . ; Uh , you know , anything you can envision . ; Yeah .
Bro023_850	b	Yeah . ; So there is also a threshold , of course , ; because after subtraction you can have negative energies , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1252	b	Sort of . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's still ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2170	b	I mean , both I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this . ; No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts for Mari . ; And if Mari 's too busy then ; Mmm .
Btr002_429	%--	" Pss " . ; like " groups of " ; Yeah , because it 's , um , bilabial too . ; " Fff " . you know , you 'll
Bro004_873	s	Old one . ; yeah . ; So it 's using all the nets for that ; but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference ,
Bed015_886	no	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture . ; Yeah , so b b but I think the poi ; I 'm not sure I understand
Bmr011_1293	s	but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , ; and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others .
Bmr009_315	s	Mm - hmm . ; And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same . ; e Actually , I was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap , ; but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker ,
Bmr007_39	bk	So we all forgot . ; Uh , ; From last time I wanted to Uh The An iss uh one topic from last time . ; Right ,
Bed010_725	s	And they do fine . ; If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , ; they can't . ; There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that .
Bmr028_975	%--	Yeah . And then put it in correctly and see how much that helps . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I was just thinking , do the one that 's easiest first ,
Bmr028_1127	b	That 's ; OK . ; Wow . Interesting . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_499	s	guy , uh , ; Jeremy ? I think . ; Mm - hmm . ; Anyway , yeah that 's that 's all I was gonna say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice
Bsr001_558	b	So it just depends . ; I guess , you know , I 've been using in - the - ear Walkman headphones , for you know , a long time , ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr024_1012	bk	So . ; It 's just the general ICSI back - up system is becoming saturated . ; Right . ; OK .
Bed013_1248	b	Mm - hmm . ; The next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh ; I don't know , maybe we wanna observe the uh , um , uh the length of of the words used , and , or the prosody ; Mmm .
Bro005_501	b	OK , go ahead . ; Yeah . ; And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1668	g	it 's just that it ; Uh - huh . ; But what if you wanna edit it ? ; Right ?
Bmr008_99	qw	Less . ; Less . ; Less ? ; What would you suggest as a as a change ?
Bmr024_241	s	You know , I mean , she 's going through and doing these kinds of checks . ; Uh - huh . ; And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . ; I sort of thought if I do it in sets groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current .
Bed003_314	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . ; Yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here .
Bns002_1536	s	Perez . ; Not Parez , Peire . ; PEIRE . ; Paez .
Bmr011_1513	aa	Yeah . Exactly . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1604	bk	Oh , plus the delta , ; right . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr025_583	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oops . ; Um the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on
Bro022_480	s	Yeah . ; So was that was that everything , Dave ? ; Oh . ; And I also , um , did some experiments about normalizing the phase .
Bro003_510	s	Yeah . So . ; I was just wondering because that test you 're t ; Uh - huh . ; I I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech .
Bmr029_417	%--	On the far - field ? ; Right . ; Right . So ; OK . Well , I 'll I can get started on the
Bmr015_574	ba	Yeah . ; And , uh , ; Uh - huh . ; that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up .
Bro026_958	no	because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . ; Right . ; But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . ; And so that feels I don't know how to get out of this .
Bed010_955	b	or ; So , she 's she 's now out here ; she 's moved , ; OK .
Bmr009_1368	s	Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , I shouldn't say that . ; I have no clue . ; I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City .
Bns003_962	s	and that means we have to drop Multicast from the proposal . ; Any comments ? ; Oh , not really , you know , ; uh , I I I I think that Well , in the future , somebody will come to the NSA group
Bmr031_1041	b	rather than " uh - huh " . ; I 'm ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1305	bk	but it constrains the words to lie within the t the time bins of the reference . ; Within the segment . ; Yep . ; I see .
Bed013_902	b	And it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces . ; OK . Eh I have taken care that we actually can build little interfaces , to other modules that will tell us whether the user likes these things and , n the or these things , ; and he whether he 's in a wheelchair or not , ; OK .
Bed016_573	s	Mm - hmm . ; So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal ; and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar . ; And it is the same grammar .
Bro010_1123	bk	I 'm definitely interested in this area , too , ; f uh , acoustic feature stuff . ; Uh - huh . ; OK .
Bmr023_539	b	Mm - hmm . ; I agree . ; Mmm . I totally agree . ; Uh .
Bro018_697	s	So . ; Did you find any more mistakes in their tables ? ; Oh ! ; Uh I haven't gone through the entire table , yet .
Bmr024_1309	s	Um ; Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations . ; Hmm . ; Uh , in this case four .
Bro012_843	s	Mm - hmm . ; you know , you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the variance is just sort of like the next moment ,
Bmr005_1311	s	We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to . ; Then , having the data is very valuable , ; cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it . ; It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data .
Bns003_339	s	I don't know , I t I tried to set up everything by today for this page ; cuz I 've started with this , ; um , if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you then just let m ; cuz I have some points like um I don't know f yeah , like Pacific Bell ,
Bmr020_1619	s	And to to re - run 's ; Eh , um . Yeah . I 've got a a P - a method with loops into the cross - correlation with the PZM mike , ; Uh - huh . ; and then to reject everything which which seems to be breath .
Bed006_403	s	Well , so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words . ; Hopefully . ; t That they 'll be here ? ; Yes . In a sense that 's exactly the the the idea ,
Bmr008_1267	b	So . ; OK , enough on forms . ; OK , so we 're running kind of late , ; OK .
Bsr001_1288	%--	Uh um . ; And it ; I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on " ; or ?
Bdb001_1013	b	Sure . ; So this would be like for the F - zero ; I mean , if you do " man P - file " or " apropos P - file " , you 'll see a lot . ; True .
Bro023_65	s	Oh , OK . ; and then , um , we can go on . ; So . ; So , um , since we 're looking at putting this , um mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , um , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , um , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean .
Bmr026_148	b	Uh The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . ; And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . ; So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more . ; Right .
Bmr001_407	s	Well no I mean it 's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes . ; That 's forty minutes ; Right . ; So , six gigabytes .
Bro022_186	s	So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio . ; Um . ; And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio ; and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background .
Bro017_1212	s	Maybe we can set that up . ; Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered , ; right ? ; but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something .
Bmr009_424	b	If there 's time . ; Yeah . ; Then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or ; Yeah .
Bmr010_451	s	That 's right . ; if , uh that that , uh , as the point person on it . ; But ; Yeah , I think that 's right .
Bro028_797	s	or ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . I just saw the Eurospeech ; We we didn't talk about it at our meeting
Bro007_277	b	Yeah . ; The number of of sentences , no it 's the number isn't . ; Yeah sure sure . ; Yeah sure .
Bro028_972	s	um , and that 's our time scale for features , ; but you could using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions ; which have a lot longer time scale ; and , um , some which have a lot shorter ,
Bns001_869	s	I do not know exactly um uh what he is doing , ; but , he 's also interesting in some kind of collaboration . ; He 's also a professor in the UCB . ; And uh many universities
Bed002_1029	s	OK . ; Well , anyway . f Get one . ; OK ? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , ; doesn't matter which one ,
Bro014_161	b	So , together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments . ; Mm - hmm . ; So . ; Hmm .
Buw001_550	b	because that 's just one person 's perception . ; And , um , ; you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_233	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Did you happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ? ; Yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what I meant .
Bmr020_1695	ba	Oh , I 'd be delighted . ; Yeah . ; And there 's there 's one point which I uh yeah , which which I r we covered when I when I r listened to one of the EDU meetings , ; Great .
Btr002_1841	%	" Eech - eech " , or something . ; he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ? ; " Whee - whee " . ; What ?
Bmr018_1011	s	You s I thought you said Ryan . ; And it 's like , " Who 's Ryan ? " ; OK . ; Yeah , good question .
Btr001_1197	aa	This is fine with me . ; OK ? ; That 's fine too . ; Yeah .
Bed006_252	s	um " take in uh a batch of art " ; um ; " visit ; do some sightseeing "
Bed003_1386	%--	Yeah , that 's what it 's called . ; and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution ; and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . ; So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know ,
Bmr029_268	s	No . It 's because for all the for the adaptation and normalization steps , you cannot ; you have to d you have to , uh , um , ; you cannot chop it up into small pieces . ; So , you 're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker , uh , is s speaking .
Bro010_1196	%--	Do y do you know any references to any ? ; Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . ; Uh , ; I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do
Bed015_2018	aa	But whatever . ; Uh , those are over rated . ; Yeah , no , no , no no . ; Right .
Bro019_386	%--	to see that how much the baseline itself improves ; by just supplying the information of the I mean the w speech and nonspeech . ; And uh , ; I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh .
Bed006_645	s	OK . ; Then uh on to the modeling . ; Right ? ; Yeah , yeah , I guess .
Bmr003_969	b	So . ; So I I need to we need to look at what what the final output is ; but it seems like we it doesn't it seems like it 's not really not that hard to have an automatic tool to generate the phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_409	s	Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years . ; Anyway , it 's fine ; I don't know . ; Well , the thing abou the reason , uh , one reason for putting " Optional " might be if it uh , made the form seem gentler and k and not as intrusive kind of thing .
Bmr002_1195	qy	OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that . ; The question is , " is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval ? " ; Uh - huh . ; So , w will the application the Meeting Recorder application , work ?
Buw001_618	s	We sh we should ; I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , ; Well , I don't know . ; and and instrumented rooms .
Bro018_807	b	Right . ; and you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done . ; And I was asking if you were going to do redo it uh for PLP with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1156	ba	So s ; I know I know Ch - Chafe dealt with ; And then it 's got all it 's a verb now . ; That 's cool .
Bmr003_1782	s	Well that 's you know , I mean I that 's why I didn't I didn't do it ; n I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and and re - ev ; Yeah , yeah . ; and it didn't do I didn't do it in ten times the the time .
Bsr001_2388	aa	Oh , right , ; just look at the very last look at the very end . ; Just from that . ; Right ,
Btr001_1849	aa	Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances . ; Mmm . ; Right .
Btr002_816	ba	But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ? ; Just to jump it back . ; Yeah . ; Interesting .
Bmr024_419	s	Well , yeah . ; So this is just partly to inform everybody , um , and and of course to get , um , input . ; Oops . ; Um , so , uh , we had a discussion Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with Don 's work ,
Bro027_473	qw	That 's great . ; So it 's it 's not bad , ; but the problem is still that the latency is too large . ; What 's the latency ?
Bro023_66	s	and then , um , we can go on . ; So . ; So , um , since we 're looking at putting this , um mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , um , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , um , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean . ; So , I did a test , um , where I used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , um , calculate the mean .
Btr002_480	s	Do they ? ; I mean , maybe they don't really realize that you 're supposed to split it up . Or something ; like , they maybe think , " Well , I hear it just as clearly ; I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly
Btr001_1695	ba	like as though you 're gonna start speaking , ; Yeah , ; you 're about to s speak . ; which I feel is important
Bed003_1603	b	confused . ; In which case you 're supposed to alert the authorities , and see appropriate action . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_934	s	Just ; You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . ; And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . ; And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .
Bmr007_478	b	but w we ; Wh - yeah , I I agree I agree with Adam . ; But yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1630	aa	and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions . ; So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . ; Oh . I think that My understanding from Yen ; Yep .
Bmr019_1797	%--	Oops . ; get our last bit of , uh , Jose 's Jose Jose 's digit ; or ? ; You eh
Bns002_973	g	it could be , say , this stingy mechanism to trying to avoid to use any extra space is also leading to a higher level of interference at the receivers . ; So , uh ; at the end of the road , we have to uh look for some trade - offs to avoid too much uh interference at the receivers . ; OK ?
Bed010_790	b	Mm - hmm . ; Very kind of you stop back and suddenly it goes away ; and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1128	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . ; We have different languages , ; we have different different noises ,
Btr001_706	b	and then the time bin starts . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that happens a lot . ; Yeah right .
Bro024_1802	%--	Up at D I copy one of the bad result . ; So you ; And ; There . You know , this .
Bro013_713	cc	um and um ; we don't really know how fast the um the reverberation response is varying the Meeting Recorder data ; um so um we we have this um block least squares um imp echo canceller implementation ; and um I want to try finding the the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller
Bro010_246	no	so ; we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance .
Bmr003_289	ba	That 's right . ; Yeah . ; I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there . ; That would be kind of fun .
Bmr014_413	b	but but in addition ; yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly .
Bro018_185	s	because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this ; you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net
Bmr024_170	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Some latency or something . ; Hiccups .
Btr002_492	b	They probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting , or w anything . ; Yeah , it 's really a an odd task in in a way ; because they 're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1216	s	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report . ; Lucash , I think , uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system . ; reasonably uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel ,
Bro014_1144	b	Oh ! OK . ; Yeah . ; and that 's that should be flat for ; Yeah .
Bro017_37	s	Like the voice activity detector , ; Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector . ; Right . ; And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " .
Bed003_174	%--	Hmm . ; but not a landmark at all . ; Not a landmark at all . ; There 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for
Bmr005_701	%--	OK . I I I I w I I wanted to ; Do y do you think that would speed it up ? ; Uh , speed up your your your marking ? ; nnn , I don't understand very .
Bro015_25	s	Yeah , I mean it may not happen . ; I mean he wants uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's he 's uh thinking of going someplace , ; Mm - hmm . ; but it 's I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here .
Bro015_76	%--	They they t I think they will tend to go this way , but hmm . ; Uh . ; Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also ; So @ @ it was t
Bro028_63	b	Yeah , uh - huh . ; Yeah . We probably should do that pretty soon so that we don't get used to it being a certain way . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_838	s	We could I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the MFCC 's and just try them with the ICSI uh front - end . ; Yeah . ; Because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um to the PLP c ; Yeah , Dan added that in ,
Bsr001_805	s	Mmm . ; Exactly . ; So . ; I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID .
Bmr002_494	s	Yeah , absolutely . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But um , yeah , that 's quite you know we 've That 's been done .
Bed010_1074	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh . is it a take - home final ? ; Yeah .
Bed006_330	s	No ? ; No more questions ? ; So what 's the s this is what you made , Fey ? ; I 'm not sure I totally understand this
Bmr028_109	bk	And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . ; So there 's a little user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution . ; Great ! ; I see .
Bed009_348	s	and ; OK so , th that uh , ; Yes . ; We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .
Btr001_2578	%	Let 's do simultaneous digits . ; No , let 's let 's not . ; Let 's do simultaneous digits . ; We
Bmr016_591	%--	So , we basically , um , did a lot of work on that ; OK then , it 's already been mailed . ; yeah . ; and it 's
Bro026_962	b	Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . ; Right ? ; Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_727	bk	these guys are doing eh what they call uh " B - connected networks " , ; they are trying all the network nodes to have at least two neighbors . ; OK , ; mm - hmm .
Bed002_431	bk	So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue . ; So if someone says something you could ask them . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro004_1126	s	The median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity . ; Mm - hmm . ; You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . ; And then it 's going through and just throwing the data away .
Bmr008_518	s	No , no . ; It would only be f if you said American English ; yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them ; then you 'd put the regions .
Bro023_1686	s	Yeah . ; Uh ; Yeah , so there are with this technique there are some ; I just did something exactly the same as as the Ericsson proposal
Bro027_21	aa	Um , I can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU . ; This is for ; ASRU . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1575	s	Um . ; But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits ; because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable . ; Uh , so I have to test it .
Bro004_1103	s	Yeah , it says what it is . ; But I don't how that 's different from ; From the baseline . OK . ; I think this was I think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in Oregon .
Bmr026_1225	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's negligible , OK . ; Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .
Bsr001_1012	b	Right . ; Hmm . ; I mean , could be reassuring , ; Yeah .
Bro023_1115	b	And they convolve the time domain signal with that . ; Oh , I see . ; And they do some smoothing on that final filter , impulse response . ; Hmm .
Bmr028_1017	s	Well , there 're different ways of thinking about it . ; I mean that that would be true if w you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes . ; But if you only had your PDA sitting in front of you ; Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much .
Bmr027_1136	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . That would be a shame if people said " well , I don't approve it because the it 's not what I said " . ; OK . ; Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,
Bmr006_1773	s	I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . ; I I agree . ; I I agree with Jane . ; For a bunch of reasons , legal .
Bmr001_52	s	OK , which is a a l a lapel , ; in fact it 's sticking through my lapel . ; Yes . ; OK so this is this is the PZM nearest the eh eh the machine room end of the table .
Bro011_694	s	if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Doesn't have to go down .
Bed002_190	bk	so don't have them use this one . ; It 'll just be sitting here . ; Input ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_799	aa	I mean I mean adjust . ; So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . ; So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , ; Absolutely .
Bmr031_942	qw	Yeah , we have new hardware . ; So , I want to set it up at some point , ; so I just wanted to know what meeting schedules were . ; What new hardware ?
Bro017_398	b	like because uh uh ; Latency and things . ; latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1020	b	well , I guess they have the NYC , ; but New England has a bunch of very different dialects ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1202	s	But not much on the in the other cases . ; Yeah . ; And ; if we have no , uh , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , um , i the system is Uh , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before ,
Btr002_996	s	if I was just at school , and I come here , it 's just ; Oh yeah . ; or vice versa ; it 's just , uh it 's like I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different ,
Bro010_716	s	sure . ; It 's the same . ; I I know p I don't know if people tried this for Aurora . ; Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme
Bmr031_151	s	Wow ! That 's getting pretty good . ; And I haven't actually caught up with , uh ; since I got back so recently from my vacation . ; Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone .
Bmr001_378	s	So we can do some more recordings but there 's there 's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month , say . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely . ; So , um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all .
Bro019_723	aa	Perfect to match . ; Yeah . ; because it 's artificially added noise . ; Yeah .
Bro013_161	s	uh ; let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case .
Bmr007_629	s	If if the goal were to just look at overlap you would you could serve yourself save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words . ; but ; Yep . ; Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics , on the close - talking mikes ,
Bed014_687	b	For But ; Right . ; You could just hav uh , just basically , ob it It observes an er , it sets the a node for " entered " or " true " or something , ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1205	s	Is it S - diff ? ; Yep . ; Mmm . ; Something like that ,
Bsr001_2285	b	Yes , ; in the other meetings we have . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_514	bk	That 's alright . ; See you . ; OK . ; See you .
Bed013_642	s	w and a week of business in Germany . ; I should mention that for you . ; And otherwise you haven't missed much , ; except for a really weird idea ,
Bmr024_39	b	Oh . ; Files and directories ? ; Files and directories . ; Yep .
Bro025_150	2	Mm - hmm . ; I I I don't have a sense of ; It 's just one percent off of the best proposal . ; Best system .
Bed015_228	bk	Minor min problem ; Minor point . ; Extremely . ; OK .
Bed006_678	%--	the fact that we 're calling this " action schema " right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this " action schema " . ; But what that means is we have here first of all ; on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of Source - Path - Goal actions ; Actions that can be categorized with
Bmr012_1037	bk	Wow . ; And we just need one more so so ; Yeah at least w we got the good ones . ; Yeah .
Bed011_702	%--	Everywhere . ; is it like ; you can't get to the Philosophers ' Way very well , ; but ,
Bed012_68	ba	To convert it into the Java Bayes for format ? ; Yep . ; OK . ; That 's That 's no problem ,
Bed009_1000	s	Ah . ; Uh to the form of of uh conceptual grammar that that w we have in mind for this . ; Mmm , ah . ; It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning .
Bmr024_1091	%--	My intention is to do a script that 'll do everything . ; I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ? ; No . ; Or s ?
Bns002_1599	ft	but um eh I have to also figure out everything from the scratch . ; I am not a total expert for for the future wireless networks . ; OK . ; Then I would like to thanks everybody
Bro024_1736	aa	Yeah . ; Uh . ; s So to summarize the performance of these , SpeechDat - Car results is similar than than yours so to say . ; Yeah ,
Bmr031_620	bh	Or is the breathing and things ? ; We already do that . ; Shorten does that automatically . ; Yeah ?
Bmr022_659	%--	In order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against . ; So ; It 's just an idea , if if it turns out that ; I mean , I also like this idea of high and low beeps , or
Bro016_734	%--	Mmm . ; Wh - ? ; But let me ask you this . ; What what 's the , um ?
Bmr025_819	s	by whispering " one , two , three , four " onto the microphone ; Hmm . ; and uh , you know . ; Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end
Bro016_304	%--	Maybe we 're not . ; You know ? ; As for these other things , it may turn out that , uh , it 's kind of reasonable . ; But then
Bns001_127	s	Mm - hmm . ; Thank you . ; So , thanks , Miguel . ; Yeah , we m discussed it yesterday that you 'll maybe will have a talk next Tuesday
Bro003_872	b	from Paris , ; OK . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed003_1113	bk	Uh , yeah . we do ; Does he ; I I saw directory called " source " , ; Oh .
Bed013_415	s	Good . ; Was he supposed to harass me ? ; Yes . ; Well , he just told me that you came looking for me .
Bmr011_243	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; So we might as well get it as uniform as we can . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1438	s	Speaking of dance , ; Dance Dance Revolution ; I can't believe I 'm ; It 's a it 's like a game , but it 's for , like , dancing .
Bmr007_1098	s	Yeah , I think th ; Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting . ; I think it 's a great idea . ; That could be fun .
Bed017_69	ba	That 's for the data collection . ; As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , ; which as of this morning should be resolved . ; Good .
Bed015_1796	ba	I 'll tell you how . ; When we 're not on tape . ; I 'd love to know . ; Oh , man .
Bed010_248	%--	Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where
Bro022_413	bk	So , what w ? ; With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? ; And ; Yeah .
Bmr010_835	b	And that and what they 're doing is in both cases just saying " curly brackets laughing " a after the unit . ; As as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words I think that 's sufficient , ; Yeah . ; Good .
Bed010_629	b	which is you You 're familiar with th with the " origo " ? ; where that 's the center " Origo " is the center of the f frame of reference . ; And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized . ; Hmm .
Btr002_3122	bk	Hmm ! ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1565	s	You could do that . ; for instance , um ; So , I guess , ; it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing .
Bmr007_90	%--	So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , ; so Basically , um as you know , uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap . ; It 's not indicated with , um uh , tight precision , it 's just indicated that OK , so , It 's indicated to to so the people know what parts of sp which which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others . ; So , I used this mark and , um and , uh uh , divided the
Bed016_613	b	The b the the double arrow . ; Yep . ; So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away . ; No .
Bro011_401	s	Um , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . ; I can't remember what his name was . ; Dang . ; Now I 'll think of it .
Btr001_1620	b	Mm - hmm . ; It 's like kind of , you know , somebody 's helping me a little bit , ; but I 'm actually doing the work anyway , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1808	s	If we put everything , we improve a lot u the spectral use of the VTS ; but the final result are not still mmm , good like the Wiener filter for example . ; I don't know . ; Maybe it 's @ @ it 's possible to to have the same result .
Bed003_312	b	that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . ; Inferred from the other ones ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed003_1063	ar	or whatever you call it . ; Anyway , there it is . ; So this is sort of LISP - y ? ; No .
Bmr024_536	%--	Synthesis system . ; Yeah . ; Um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that . ; And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is
Bmr026_271	s	But it it seems to me that I c ; And ; It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . ; So yo It seems to me you could do images .
Bmr018_1019	s	Yep . ; we need to get a decent f ; OK . ; That 's what my hope has been ,
Bed010_46	s	Yeah . ; So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a er in XML ; and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . ; And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form .
Buw001_1407	b	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; Well , and and also ; Hmm .
Bmr024_441	s	it does all the work for you . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring .
Bro028_512	s	But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is . ; Uh , they on their web site they , uh , did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task . ; And , um , the Mississippi State system using a bigram grammar , uh , is at about eight point two percent . ; Other comparable systems from , uh were getting from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight percent .
Bro021_225	b	So , I mean , again , if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise , you 'd you know , given enough training data you don't do b do badly . ; The reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because it 's different in training and test . ; Even if the general kind is the same , the exact instances are different . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_527	b	Yeah . ; W wel I mean I A quick conversation with Brian would be good , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro004_542	s	It 's the same ; uh Aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test
Bmr011_1406	s	And Mari 's also interested in it , ; Andreas as well . ; So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , " well " , and that " well " is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag . ; Uh , and things like that ,
Bed014_1206	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , um . ; And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , ; the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to uh , indefinite pronouns
Bro027_499	s	or ; No , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . ; Um ; then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames .
Bdb001_1183	b	uh , ; Well , all the Switchboard in it . ; utterance types . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_999	no	Or even , you know , I mean , some people who just don't change much in their ; So , ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I 'm I don't know .
Bmr028_803	s	Uh - huh . ; And at some point , I 'd like to get back to , uh , porting Quicknet to the multiprocessor Linux box . ; Yeah . ; You know , I I have forward passes working , but I haven't done training yet .
Bro017_812	s	But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model . ; You train it on the original vector . ; But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model , ; and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data . s by the same amount .
Bed002_1105	x	For example , this th th the dialogue history is is um , producing XML documents . ; M - three - L of course is XML . ; And the ontology that um , uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . ; And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from .
Bed015_391	b	OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair . ; Yes . ; Instead of just the meaning . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1588	s	Oh , yeah . That 's OK . ; That that 's the sort of w we keep you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances . ; Yeah . ; Th - That that would work .
Bro004_676	b	Uh ; So it adapts more quickly ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2519	bk	Like I 'll go ; I would too . ; Yeah ? ; Oh .
Bmr030_294	b	Well , sure it is . ; But ; Well ; Yeah .
Btr001_1266	aa	Yeah . ; If ; but . ; No .
Bmr027_502	b	But , um , the attorneys , I uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with ; and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , ; but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact O K 'd it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_328	b	so . ; so basically you treat backchannels l as nonspeech , as pauses , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1477	b	I I I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech ; or , of the foreground speech with background speech . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_307	s	Yeah . Um ; I mean in particular I would I would really hope that when we do this DARPA meeting in July that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates .
Bmr003_2469	s	Absolutely . ; Yeah . ; Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time . ; I I I I 'm I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people ,
Btr002_59	s	I have one in front of you which is the one where , ; um , um , u ; Leah Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the transcriber interpreted it as " twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this " , ; and , um , actually what I meant to say was um , " so you 're saying groups of different sizes ,
Bns002_762	g	Let 's let 's ; no but ; Yeah but , i let 's say you have one kilobyte . ; OK ?
Bmr016_565	%--	Mm - hmm . ; since I think that 's more important to moving forward , ; but I mean Morgan has this paper copy ; and if people have questions ,
Bro007_46	b	Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation . ; Yeah ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1326	%	And so but he 's only here until until one ; and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time ; so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . ; S
Bmr028_679	s	I thought he I thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time . ; So I think he ; Yeah . I think ; Y yeah . He just didn't say when .
Bmr007_190	%--	and it 's um you you can't impose a model of there of the ideal being no overlaps , ; and you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , ; so it 's now , universally a ag agreed with . ; And and , als
Bmr018_533	s	I find it really convenient the way the way it 's set up right now . ; Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly " well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan " , right now , you have to go up to the menu , ; and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below , ; and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below .
Bns002_567	s	But I 'm thinking about this example you gave before . ; Maybe maybe you are right . ; S ; So what what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals .
Bmr014_1201	%--	Or if for ; leave it on their voice mail . ; Any sub - word level thing . ; Any sub - wor
Bmr015_197	s	The the problem also is she did want to stick with digits . ; I mean I 'm speaking for her since she 's not here . ; Yeah . ; But , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .
Bmr007_864	s	but eh I I I think , eh when when , y I I saw the the the the speech from PDA and , eh close talker . ; I I think the there is a a great difference in the in the signal . ; Oh , absolutely . ; So s my intention for this is is as an aide for ground truth .
Bed014_629	%--	Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming ; Yeah . ; which probably will blow all our theories , ; but but skipping that
Bsr001_2472	aa	Maybe we know them . ; Yeah . ; That 's like the TIMIT sentences . ; Right .
Bmr021_249	b	Ah , I see . ; because uh it 'll it 'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_219	s	Well it might be just good to know what it looks like . ; Yeah . ; Cuz ; That 's That 's uh cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right ,
Bro025_716	s	So , I 'm I 'm , um , taking a look at some of , um , Sangita 's work on on TRAPS . ; She did something where , um w where the TRAPS learn ; She clustered the the temporal patterns of , um , certain certain phonemes in in m averaged over many , many contexts . ; And , uh , some things tended to cluster .
Bmr003_1096	g	Yeah . ; And then there 's the problem also that ; No , but I mean , they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material . ; That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ?
Bro014_1298	bk	so , ; So you don't have one for unvoiced picture ? ; Uh , not here . ; Oh .
Bmr024_901	b	Year or two ? ; Yep . ; Wow . ; Hmm .
Bmr031_1657	ba	and other conditions it doesn't . ; Mm - hmm . ; And now we 're understanding trying to understand what those are . ; It - it 's it 's it 's fun .
Bed009_1048	s	Mmm . ; and so s ; So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level . ; And from there to the appropriate decisions .
Bro023_255	s	I mean , I know in the large vocabulary stu uh , uh , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass ; but other people didn't and had multiple passes . ; And , um , ; the argument , um , against multiple passes was u u has often been " but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response " .
Bed009_492	b	I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant . ; Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention . ; And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_261	s	Mm - hmm . ; But , the machines that don't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , ; Mm - hmm . ; they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . Automatically .
Bro010_567	s	and , uh , ; so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . ; And then you look over the whole thing ; and now you have a noise spectrum .
Bro021_1068	ft	No ? ; I see . ; OK , I understand now . ; Alright , thanks .
Bed003_1667	s	Yep . ; Ah , interesting . ; Why does SmartKom need a network ? ; Um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a DHCP request ,
Bro010_410	b	Good good to know . ; But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , ; so you just kind of , uh ; Yeah .
Bmr009_274	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; eh in the middle eh a zone of overlapping with mmm less energy ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_178	s	So I 'm I 'm going to start thinking about um ways that the ph that the phase could be used . ; Um . ; Si - if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive . ; So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would would help .
Bmr018_1409	2	actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this , ; but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that , uh , you know , got our interest , ; and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference , ; Present .
Bdb001_728	h	So . ; That 's good . ; So you gave some examples like ; Well ,
Bsr001_1369	bk	Yeah . ; I mean , that 's the question . ; If if we are collecting these at different sites , different kinds of tasks , different people , what is there that 's gonna be uniform about this collection ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_872	bk	Or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ? ; For each frequencies I a I 'm adding some , uh , noise , ; but the a the amount of the amount of noise I add is not the same for all the frequency bins . ; Ah !
Bmr011_1815	s	for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , ; because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .
Bmr010_591	s	Well , just talk to him about it . ; Yep . ; Good . ; I mean , you know , basically he 's he just studies , he 's a colleague ,
Bro023_1510	s	and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima of the energy . ; And then average these minima and take this as an an energy estimate of the noise for this particular frequency band . ; And there is something more to this actually . ; What is done is that , uh , these minima are computed , um , based on , um , high resolution spectra .
Bmr014_235	bk	No ? ; we 're having the them do it . ; So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it . ; Oh .
Bmr025_653	b	I see . ; Cuz th they they fail after a couple years . ; OK . ; Alright .
Bed005_734	b	Nuh . ; Right . ; and all those things . ; Right .
Bed015_346	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but that 's OK . ; I mean , we we we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh with , a p
Bro026_371	%	Yeah , so I I think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . ; Uh , they have some cepstral modification , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2092	s	Occasionally . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored .
Btr001_158	s	And so if if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine ; That 's right . ; Oh . ; and if it w was bigger , then it was like torture ,
Bmr019_723	b	and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed signal " ; and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying " mixed " ; I think , Morgan . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr013_289	b	Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . ; And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr021_427	b	Right . ; So we could leave those as they are . ; Well , I mean , it just depends on how much disk space is a problem . ; Right .
Bmr018_1188	s	OK , Andreas is leaving leaving the building . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; See ya .
Bmr020_1460	s	Send it to them . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And , you know , then they 'll send us back what we w what what they send back to us ,
Bed011_153	s	oh , I see , we have to ; Yeah , it 's tricky . ; We 'll let 's let we 'll do that off - line , OK . ; Yeah , but I i i it 's happening .
Bmr018_1131	%--	Yeah , for Eurospeech we want some results ; if we can get them . ; Well , yeah , it it 's probably wouldn't make sense , ; Or some or some
Bro010_162	%--	Yeah . ; Um , ; But , well , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright . ; We would be at six
Bmr001_344	s	uh there 's I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; Well we 've got we 've got Right now we could have two more people on wireless ,
Bmr021_24	ba	They don't work for me very well . ; That 's right . ; Yeah right . ; I much prefer these .
Bed002_396	%--	Um , the idea would be that you , uh , take your ; You 're editing your slide ? ; Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , ; uh w uh .
Bmr030_41	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; And to do research on the meetings . ; Cool .
Bro013_47	s	So . There is one difference ; Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . ; So there is ; It 's their complete system and including on - line uh unsupervised adaptation .
Bro027_326	s	So they are actually trying to , uh , fix that those values using the clean , uh , training part of the Wall Street Journal . ; Which is ; I mean , the Aurora . ; Aurora has a clean subset .
Btr002_989	b	I totally do that now . ; I don't think I 'm that bad , ; but ; Yeah , yeah .
Btr002_875	b	Oh , uh , in terms of , um , if , uh if it 's it 's if it 's cut off , ; like the beginning of an utterance , ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1707	%--	If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in . ; I like how we 've you guys have successfully narrowed it down . ; " Is one of you going to be the subject ? " ; Is one of you
Bro018_886	b	Yeah . ; So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_646	no	if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe , like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to uh , speakers of the same sex . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I don't know .
Bmr018_470	b	a at some point ; No , I mean the individual channels that were chopped up that ; it 'd be nice to be able to go back and forth between those short segments . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_1401	s	Or can they ? ; I don't know . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's linearized .
Bro027_636	%	The hundred milla ; mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . ; It could be eighty ; and and probably do @ @
Bed015_571	b	we we 're ; Yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed010_183	s	Hmm . ; Oh OK . ; And , ; so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .
Bmr028_1673	qw	What does it put out ? ; Really ? ; Johnson noise ? ; But then how are y how are you detecting during a meeting ?
Bro018_1100	s	I use that to normalize the s the current center frame by mean subtraction . ; And I then then I move to the next frame and I I do it again . ; Well , actually I calculate all the means first ; and then I do the subtraction .
Bmr003_455	bk	is that right ? ; Uh , in fact we get it for free ; cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC . ; Oh .
Btr002_1332	s	I also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed , ; so I don't think you could use a string search , right ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked .
Bro003_12	t3	Alright ; Going again ; Uh So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do do our digits . ; Uh transcript one three one one dash one three three zero . three two three four seven six five five three one six two four one six seven seven eight nine zero nine four zero zero three zero one five eight one seven three five three two six eight zero three six two four three zero seven four five zero six nine four seven four eight five seven nine six one five O seven eight O two zero nine six zero four zero zero one two Uh Yeah , you don't actually n need to say the name .
Bed011_711	%--	but I think other things you can , if I remember right . ; So is like " biking there " part of like " driving there " , ; Yeah , um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component . ; or ?
Bro011_450	b	it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and ; Right . ; Um . So . ; Right .
Bmr014_52	%--	uh , it it could be a number of things . ; It could be touching and fiddling , ; Yeah . ; and the other thing is that it could
Bro005_893	%--	Yeah . ; So ; Yeah . ; But
Bed011_82	ar	mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all . ; OK . ; Or have you heard about it ? ; Not that much
Bed011_780	s	Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t ; Mm - hmm . ; If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ? ; And , Timing , uh , uh , Length would definitely be part of it ,
Bmr015_1087	s	Sorry , not being very fluent here . ; But , um , ; this the discourse side will have a script which will stri strip away the things which are non - communicative . ; OK . So then the then let 's let 's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths .
Bmr009_1048	s	Northwest ? ; Yeah . ; But ; Yeah , so this is a real problem .
Bmr019_1408	bk	I mean , you could you could do a paper on what 's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it . ; How well does an Aurora system do on on you know , on digits collected in a in this environment ? ; Different way . ; Yeah .
Bed015_2231	%	If it 's equal for all ? ; What should we do ? ; Yeah , it 's fine . ; Fine .
Bro004_438	d	So , it 's it 's three or three and four . ; Did you do different languages from digits ? ; Uh . No . ; You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ?
Buw001_1730	s	I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , ; um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up , ; The URL ; so they can click on an utterance and hear it .
Bmr005_832	b	Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . ; I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of ; That was that was exactly the notion that that that we discussed . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_45	s	And . ; But . ; So . There is one difference ; Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation .
Bmr031_1669	s	they actually put a bunch of fish in the lake for him . ; Oh . ; Really s really hungry fish . ; It 's part of the budget .
Bro024_1256	s	which ; Well , it 's not trained on Finnish . ; uh ; It 's worse .
Buw001_1188	t3	Is that OK ? ; We 'll probably hit horrible traffic . ; Sounds ; OK .
Bro027_1767	%	Uh , that 's similar . ; Yeah , ; I mean , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously , ; but it 's @ @
Bsr001_949	b	But yeah , they they have ; Uh - huh . ; And and it 's hard to even follow what they 're saying . ; Uh - huh .
Bro011_194	%--	and that 's probably the best thing to do . ; And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there ; in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something ; and in addition to
Bmr024_374	s	It 's pretty distinct . ; The beeps are pre - recorded . ; Yeah ? ; It 'll only be a problem for m for mine .
Btr002_1966	%--	That 's really funny . ; Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that . ; Well , it is There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type , ; um , i when I was sitting here and we were doing
Bro003_460	aa	Yeah , ; right ? ; Which is PLP , or something ? ; right .
Bed008_178	%--	so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . ; Yeah . ; Right ? ; And then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences .
Bmr023_924	s	The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , ; so that it 's irrelevant . ; Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . ; We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L
Bsr001_246	s	So , ; Yes , ; that 's right . ; I mean , this this thing of course is probably , you know , acoustically more challenging
Bed014_1343	qh	Mm - hmm . ; and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things . ; Right . ; But when it 's like , well , w how do we capture these things , you know , I think it 's definitely been Keith and I who have d you know , who have worried more about the
Bro003_301	b	Uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean " using the net " . ; but not trained on a ; So , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we 're talking about you can't do that . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1267	aa	OK . ; And and then ; Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Buw001_1061	s	Yeah , read the digits , ; do the summary . ; Right . ; But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay .
Bed015_1774	s	Uh great word in the English language is called " about " . ; If you study how people use that it 's also ; What 's the word ? ; " about . "
Bed011_450	b	But were you saying that ; I need those back by the way . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_980	s	Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think , ; Yeah . ; because ; It seems to me that sending them email , saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,
Bmr001_478	s	Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use we 'd only use the distant mikes , ; OK . ; right ? ; Yeah so it might be four .
Bmr005_41	s	and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . ; So uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around ; and and uh sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things . ; Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events ,
Bro021_896	%--	and down here you have you you put the ; depends on T , ; w o ; but b all of this is just you just mean
Bmr001_681	s	I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case .
Bmr003_2358	bk	Yeah . ; Which is to say just laptop with a wireless . ; Yeah , yeah , ; Oh .
Bed002_876	s	Like , w ; what you 're doing now ? ; or ; Well , we 'll see what people do .
Bmr029_332	%--	two , th We have two , three , four , fi ; I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with . ; Four that you worked with ? ; I think it 's
Bsr001_1099	s	Right , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; So , on one question .
Btr002_526	s	Hmm . ; Because the acoustics of it it just fits into the hea a hearer 's range ; For announcements and things ? ; Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , um , better than a lot of female voices .
Bro003_1314	s	Oh , ; it 's not actually broader class , ; it 's actually finer class , ; but you mean y You mean more classes .
Bmr028_163	bk	just so we can play the audio file , too . ; Right . ; Um , with th with the display . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr010_381	s	Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer , ; Good . ; and since he 's not here , I 'll repeat it ; to at least modify Transcriber ,
Bed006_961	b	OK , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; OK .
Bmr015_1095	b	I mean , if you 're getting a breath several times every minute , ; Mm - hmm . ; and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate , to put the boundaries in , to to type it in , i it 's just a huge amount of time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_655	s	but ; He 's tethered . ; s ; basically , the the cube will have three dimensions .
Bmr005_1010	b	We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not . ; So ; Yeah and th the the other thing is I 'm not pos ; OK .
Bro023_1541	qw	So if you take these minima , it b they will overestimate the noise a lot . ; So you take sixty - four millisecond F F Ts and then you average them over five hundred ? ; Or ? ; Uh , what do you do over five hundred ?
Bed010_846	s	I ; Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh ; It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . ; So . It 's always been out of phase
Bed005_1430	%--	I don't know . ; That 's the question is " to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? " ; And I don't know . ; Well , no , but I mean What I uh the
Bro028_104	cc	Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ? ; I d I d uh , I I don't kn remember exactly , ; but Uh . ; Yeah , I c I I have to check that .
Bro023_414	%--	I mean , even the medium mismatch is pretty much the same . ; And the high mismatch was improved by twenty percent absolute . ; OK , ; and what kind of number
Bed003_1485	qw	But not transcontinentally . ; I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself . ; What ? ; Why ?
Bro019_1395	s	and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition . ; Um , ; and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events . ; And , um , so I I been I been thinking about that
Bed003_89	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; Uh I 'll also get rid of this " Click to add notes " . ; OK .
Bmr010_1476	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; we should at least look at the space and understand ; Yeah .
Bro017_737	s	Mm - hmm . ; If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know the the the the component which I I mean di dimension wh ; Mm - hmm . ; All of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to C - one , you put them to zero .
Bmr028_855	b	so maybe then , that wouldn't be so bad . ; But there 's a whole interesting discussion , ; cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either , ; Oh .
Bro026_87	bk	Right . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_626	s	Um , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? ; I don't know . ; You know ? The ; Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate a separate set up
Bmr016_260	qw	OK . ; They 're such major sources of variance that it 's it 's it 's uh ; Yeah I mean read versus not . ; What 's an example of a of m some of the other differences ?
Bmr001_550	b	I think it does that . ; Yeah , so , P Z ; Yeah , well . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1060	b	hand crafted , ; but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances , and from ontologies , ; and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces , in terms of output . ; Uh
Bmr014_231	ar	Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets ; meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , ; right ? ; Uh , no ,
Buw001_2102	aa	It 's those guys . ; I hadn't known that then they 'd done any more than that . ; Oh , they only did the far - field ? ; Yeah .
Bmr001_872	b	It 's interesting that um it m it 's not clear whether it 's better to have them written as as words or or figures . ; But , of course , to get zero and " O "s distinguished we you have to do it . ; That 's why , ; yep .
Bns002_793	%--	But , anyway , uh , well , depending on on the network , you now , the the the this ; I will have to translate this , ; uh ; It shou should be something ipsh
Bro021_702	%--	And then I in that process I messed it up somewhere . ; So . ; OK . ; So , it was real
Bro012_324	b	Seven seems like a lot to me ; and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time ; I mean to do one turn - around of the well matched case takes like a day . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_600	%--	that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; W
Bmr013_706	ba	but they might not be horrible . ; Yeah . ; So but I 'll let you know when we , uh , have that . ; OK , great .
Bsr001_920	aa	Right . ; Right . ; So they , you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this , you know , you 'd turn off your radio . ; Yes .
Bro025_726	aa	Mm - hmm . ; And , um , so , those are interesting things to ; So you 're now you 're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features ? ; Right .
Bro011_651	b	but just sort of eh you know you t you i z ; Yeah . ; The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1131	s	It 's ; Yep , ; So ch So every everybody ta Talk really fast . ; we have to have a short meeting .
Bed006_1124	s	and decide the level of of abstraction that that you aim at it kind of zero in on that , ; Right . ; Yeah . ; and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that that you want to constant draw from from sub - tasks um that are relevant
Bmr005_747	%--	right ? ; I 'm sorry . ; So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures ; such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as
Bmr010_817	bk	They are . ; um ; They 're putting Eh , so in curly brackets they put " inhale " or " breath " . ; OK .
Bmr016_2089	s	Percent 's easy to detect . ; Point however is is uh a word that has a couple different meanings . ; And you 'll find both of those in one of these meetings , ; where he 's saying " well the first point I wanna make is so - and - so "
Bed014_1057	b	Mm - hmm . ; I wo I would like I would sort of get a get a notion of what what you guys have in store for me . ; OK . I was actually gonna work on it for tomorrow like this this weekend . ; Yeah .
Buw001_554	bk	and and people have different major topics that they 're interested in . ; A ; So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , ; OK .
Bro023_289	s	Yep . ; Um , so , ; the last two weeks was , like ; So I 've been working on that Wiener filtering .
Bed009_1099	s	Uh , OK , ; th ; part of it comes from the ontology . ; The tower is this kind of object .
Bed006_1748	s	Why ? ; It happened to c be what it stands for . ; Well ; It just happened to be the acronym .
Bmr021_914	ba	I see . ; So , you know , the feature sets we had available . ; I see . ; And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level .
Bmr031_408	s	Yeah . ; S ; Yeah . ; Something like that .
Bed014_87	%--	and see if he has any something already . ; Sure . ; Hmm . ; That 'd be weird , that he has both the Java Bayes and the embedded Bayes in
Bed005_266	s	And so this means , um , ; Oh . ; " this " and " see " are not optional . ; " Want I like " is all maybe in there ,
Bmr006_302	b	Right ? ; That 's very easy , ; but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . ; Yeah .
Bro013_724	s	So let 's read our digits and go home . ; Um . ; S so um ; y you do I think you read some of the the zeros as O 's and some as zeros .
Bed006_238	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , um the problem with the re - phrasing , ; that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them , ; Right .
Bmr019_470	s	That factor of two . ; Mm - hmm . ; but for the everybody , it 's little under a factor or two . ; Yeah . I I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone ,
Bro024_614	b	" Training condition " ; Oh , right . ; So " clean " corresponds to " high mismatch " . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3212	bk	OK . ; m OK . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed006_192	s	Cuz I mean I I know how to contact our students , ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's generally the way it 's done . ; so if there 's something that you 're sending out you can also s um send me a copy ,
Bmr031_1454	s	Yeah . ; So th they gave me a lot of feedback . The labellers , after doing this , ; Uh - huh . ; told me what they wanted as categories .
Bed005_1419	%--	OK . Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's b It ; It 's an inter sort of a kind of a it
Bed014_1394	g	Mm - hmm . ; That it would still generate too many . Right ? ; it would still genera ; So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ?
Bro023_1358	%--	Right . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , ; b but I don't think we have to worry too much on that right now while you kno .
Bed005_149	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , the reason was that the parser i c completely ignores the verb . ; Hmm . ; So this sentence sentence is parses the p the same output ,
Bro014_1432	b	I I mean , if you were gonna ; uh , for for this purpose , that is . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_500	s	Maybe I should . ; We should we should find out . ; I mean , would the tools would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ? ; Um , th what would would would what would worry me is that maybe we might miss a little detail
Bro025_100	s	And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . ; Mm - hmm . ; Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals ; and you 're gonna end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce .
Bro018_922	b	um ; When you get the mel When you go to the mel scale . ; Right . ; Yeah ,
Bmr019_1352	bk	Uh ; There 's a special Aurora session ; and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May or something to turn in their paper . ; Oh .
Bmr018_1468	b	and that 's what 's was sort of interesting to me is that there 's different ways to do it , ; A judge . ; and ; Yep .
Bmr024_1585	b	Yeah . ; Oh , you don't . ; OK . ; Alright .
Bro027_1779	aa	But this other thing isn't perfect . ; Ah . ; So that you bring in some information from the net itself . ; Right ,
Bed008_1324	s	Yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; That 's the outcome .
Bmr006_1209	b	Yeah . ; No , it 's not it 's not that so much as ; And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_756	ar	Uh . Are your results are still with the bad the bad ; No ? ; With the better ; No ?
Bed005_1342	b	But what ; I mean , you y ; Well , that 's ; Hhh .
Bro015_112	bk	Um . ; Yeah . ; Right now , Sunil seems i is in India actually . ; Right .
Bed011_85	s	Not that much ; No . ; you didn't . ; OK . We were gonna put this in front of people .
Bro019_1139	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and another estimation of the var the variance of the difference for of the spec si uh , spectrum of the signal ; and and the spectrum of time after filt mel filter bank .
Buw001_2279	s	I 'd probably search for something like that . ; That actually has come up a couple times in queries . ; I was talking to Landay ; and that was one of his examples .
Bro026_292	b	so . ; Um , I think Tony Robinson used to do I was saying this before . I think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra . ; He used them as alternate features . ; Hmm .
Bro005_208	s	Yes . ; Yes . ; Th - Yes . ; Training of the net ,
Buw001_822	bk	And ; I 'm just The community ; If LDC collects this data u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . ; There you go .
Bro025_134	b	but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_284	s	In that case , um my c the coding that I was using since we haven't , uh incorporated Adam 's , uh coding of overlap yets , the coding of ; Yeah , " yets " is not a word . ; Uh since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet um then that would have fallen through the cra cracks . ; It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far .
Bro027_1551	%--	I mean , part of why ; I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? ; So you were just trying ; I think you r
Bmr023_980	bd	But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se . ; I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , unless you call well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more .
Bro019_646	s	Um , ; But ; but this is not significant . ; But , the problem is that it 's not significant ,
Btr002_182	s	you know , the content word will be substituted for another content word , ; and , um , ; It 's it 's not surprising that they would hear this . ; I 'm o I 'm often surprised by how how plausible something can be with without it being correct .
Buw001_2023	bk	but lessen it if if it 's desired . ; But if if that 's sufficient data ; I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . ; OK .
Bmr016_1154	s	because a a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that . ; However , things like " cuz " where you 're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable , ; and furthermore , it 's a form that 's specific to spoken language , ; those are r reasons f for those reasons I I kept that separate ,
Btr001_1853	s	Uh - huh . ; Um , ; I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . ; And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are
Bro023_670	aa	It ; It 's all pretty related , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1000	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Using wh using stone age ; using stone age tools .
Bmr018_978	s	uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker , ; so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop ; and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases , ; and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around .
Btr002_2653	bk	and then it 'll be " breath " . ; Oh , I 've ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2396	qy	I can't remember the name actually . ; OK . ; The the one that I 'm thinking of , ; i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , " Do I have time to do this ? "
Bro018_881	s	Uh - huh . ; so i I I don't know if that it probably doesn't mess it up , ; it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already in the right format or something ; but the the the two processes that happen are a little different .
Bro018_295	bk	Right . ; We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the the TI - digits . ; And now we have another noisy TIMIT also with the noise of uh Italian database . ; I see .
Bro024_601	ar	Oh . ; Still it still , uh that that 's still consistent . ; I mean , I get the best performance in the case of " Car " , which is the third column in the A condition . ; No .
Bed011_775	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; And if no no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important , no planner is ever gonna ask for it . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_539	b	Right . ; right ? ; Although the other issue is that the mixed close - talking mikes ; Yeah .
Bed009_322	s	So that 's a a discrete decision . ; Mm - hmm . ; There are only three possibilities and the uh ; what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner .
Bmr025_354	s	I mean , you 're looking at this now ; so . ; Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? ; Um yeah I 'm starting to
Bro024_1665	b	Uh Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_1014	bk	Yeah . ; Well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust . ; But it 's not popular it 's only p only ; Right , Right .
Bmr008_479	b	Are you saying that you have both ? ; Mm - hmm . ; that you 're saying , uh what is your ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_28	s	and Dietmar , maybe you then , also . ; What we have discussed , in principle , concerning the ongoing process with U USAIA and also this , uh , your current work , ; and from my point , it seems to be clear that I will go back ; definitely at tenth of December ,
Bns003_395	s	people ; normally that 's was my my , uh ; In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example ; when I tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working .
Bmr016_1703	%--	Y well , no , that 's r that 's legitimate . ; So now , uh , comments , you can see they 're listed again , ; same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . ; OK so , um , on some of these QUALs ,
Btr001_2636	bk	Oh , yeah . ; and then you can ; No , I totally agree . ; Yeah .
Bro023_979	aa	Well , yeah that 's that 's the opposite , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah .
Bmr019_1215	s	Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps . ; So , you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech . ; Right . ; Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also
Bmr016_1864	b	Um ; That 's it . ; Yeah , that 's that 's been changed . ; Yeah .
Bro012_862	2	but it may help ; That 's the first order but thing , ; First - order effects . ; And it may help to do the variance .
Bmr012_1372	s	That 's fine . ; OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . ; I 'm a Norwegian . ; Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley .
Bmr028_212	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; You just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_480	%--	different partitions of the same physical disk . ; Physical disk . ; Mmm . ; And it 's conceivable
Btr002_1086	s	Which is the ; The PC ? ; The PC one ? ; I would vote for the PC .
Bmr028_487	s	Um , a couple of them were , like , people at IBM who were here for one of the IBM meetings ; Yeah . ; and one a guy from SRI who was at one of the SRI meetings . ; And so , uh , those might be harder to track down .
Bro024_1015	%	What where was the , um the smallest latency of all the systems last time ? ; The French Telecom . ; Well , France Telecom was was was very short latency ; It 's
Bro023_841	b	Generally Well , I use , actually , a linear , uh , function of the SNR , ; Mm - hmm . ; which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the SNR is below zero DB . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_889	b	It means that at that particular frequency range you subtracted more energy than there was actually ; That means that ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro023_793	s	uh ; so the other the other thing is like I 've been I 'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum . ; So ; Tried this stuff on the mel as well
Bns003_919	s	because he 's a professor in uh , responsible for the infrastructure at UCB and he has some projects which are related to um , these these , uh , activities ; Landay . ; Ah . ; I would c c name it cor intelligent classroom .
Btr002_1039	s	Did it ; Right . ; Is that right ? ; Right . I I 'm used to it now too .
Bro026_550	qw	OK . ; Um . ; But , yeah , I think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . ; What about the , um uh , the new part of the evaluation ,
Bro021_214	bk	It 's I think , it 's whitening This the portion that are more silent , ; Cuz it 's ; as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy , it whitens everything ; Huh . Oh , OK .
Bmr016_977	s	extracts out the language , ; finds the time - marks for that particular one , ; do it that way . ; The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted
Bmr008_1628	b	because you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um , you should be much more sensitive to the to the overlaps then if you ; Yeah . ; you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2082	s	So there 'd be a subset of them used for obviously j just use the ones at this end for for this many . ; So ; Excuse me . ; you 'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on .
Bmr001_846	b	probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_991	b	and they 're ; they all have e a already background in using computers . ; They 're , um they 're trained in linguistics . ; Good .
Bmr026_685	b	Watch a ball game ? ; Yeah , real real real men " Real men do decoding " or something like that . ; Don't listen to this , Liz . ; Right .
Bmr022_981	%--	Right . ; and people would plug them in . ; You could use they could use their own . ; Oh , right . So they could use the
Btr001_734	ba	Shrink in them or whatever , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Nice .
Bro023_1474	b	Yeah , because ; I mean , the reason was like in TI - digits I don't have a lot . ; I had twenty frames most of the time . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1402	s	Mmm . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Yeah . ; You say arg - C and arg - V all the time .
Bro024_615	%--	Oh , right . ; So " clean " corresponds to " high mismatch " . ; Yeah . ; And " increase " ,
Bed006_1225	s	Oh , s so it 's sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that that is built elsewhere . ; derived ; I don't know if I u ; This is a cate this a category structure here ,
Btr002_1576	s	Nah . ; No ? ; But I did I was thinking i you know , it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings , ; and yet , i i it 's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone 's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns , I bet you , we would all agree on who it who it was .
Bed006_1806	s	I take that back then . ; It 's no problem . ; OK , well don't don't make it a high priority ; I In fact if you just tell me like you know like two examples
Bro016_1105	b	But there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of rapid changes , ; but ; It 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_243	b	And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound . ; Mm - hmm . ; Play the audio corresponding to that , um , um , feature file , ; OK .
Bmr008_288	s	OK , OK . ; So I 'm saying there are going to be What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data , a chunk of it will be uh , the same people many times ; So . ; and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people
Bmr020_1824	%--	OK . ; I don't know , ; I it doesn't ; I don't
Buw001_1656	b	OK . ; You could email to both of us , uh , just I mean , if you wanted to . ; Wh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_44	s	It 's the same , um , idea but it 's working on mel bands , and it 's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter , ; and there is also a noise addition after , uh , cleaning up the mel bins . ; Mmm . ; Well , the results are similar .
Bmr006_1506	%--	We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it ; Well , OK . ; going and dealing with it . ; It 's just
Bmr006_893	s	Is is is only ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah .
Bsr001_1514	s	Wha ; Is it the three , I see , ; Well , if you ha m u eh ; And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card
Bed015_1951	s	But anyway . ; So , is is that does that make sense as a , uh a general way to proceed ? ; Sure , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that ,
Bmr002_303	b	Yeah . ; Uh right . ; And so , one of the first questions is , " do you need help ? " ; OK .
Bed009_428	s	Clearly . ; So this i this is where I think this ; Yes . ; people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully .
Buw001_1902	qw	I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it . ; And if I get something , great . ; If I don't get something ; Who ?
Bns001_1436	s	you can have taken into account moving patterns , ; and and and whatever kind of things , ; but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance , ; and I see it as definitely is necessary to have this one
Bmr029_101	b	Actually , I did retrain ; I recently retrained , um , for another reason , on the full training set . ; And that took only I think it took only two days . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1398	s	Mm - hmm . ; and then would hash or whatever we do to say , " ah ! ; If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . " ; So , I I think we can handle that .
Bmr026_1157	qo	You gonna say something ? ; Yeah . ; I was wondering uh you know what size net I should ; Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?
Bro005_1234	s	You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , doesn't really help then we won't have it in . ; Mmm . ; If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . ; We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server .
Bed016_875	bk	Oh , I meant this , ; That 's that 's computa should be very computational , ; you know , like ; OK .
Bro004_343	s	is that JRASTA seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition . ; Mmm . ; I have a suggestion , actually , ; even though it 'll delay us slightly ,
Bro021_1053	s	Yeah . ; Capital Y . ; X . X . ; This is X , inside .
Bmr007_1281	aa	Yeah . ; Um I d I did before we do the digits , I did also wanna remind people , uh please do send me , you know , uh thoughts for an agenda , ; Agenda ? ; yeah
Btr002_2213	b	Yeah . ; Huh . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2420	b	That 's the reason , ; You should definitely ; Mm - hmm . ; uh - huh .
Bro008_533	b	Also , uh , I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . ; So one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other ; Well , i in fact , uh , m in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets , it was a single net that had different ; Yeah .
Bmr028_417	s	Uh , it 's really useful , tha ; Cuz if you 're only at part of a meeting , or something ; So , we have our first information retrieval example . ; It 's a regular expression
Bed008_1370	s	OK . ; So , ; alright . ; So this is uh step two .
Bsr001_1225	s	Right . ; Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless ; and can they afford the P Z ; and that sort of stuff .
Bmr006_764	bk	These will be assigned by hand ? ; a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , ; Based on the ; Uh - huh .
Bro004_202	fa	But ; So . ; Le - let me . ; I I I 'm sorry .
Buw001_996	aa	Without hearing each other though , probably . ; go around the table . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_46	bk	Is that what Situation is short for , ; shi situational context ? ; Yep . ; OK .
Btr002_631	b	I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1461	s	No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating . ; Well , it 's it 's ; I think you 're saying " in my experiment , I cheated in this way " . ; That 's what I was saying .
Btr002_1786	%--	and they hit the thing ; and the and there 's an error screen that comes up ; and it has this " doink " kind of sound . ; And it
Bmr026_453	s	It 's XH and D ; cuz I have four meetings on there , ; The b ; I 'm also using DG
Bro013_497	b	So it 's harder to distinguish ; It 's height . ; but it but it g ; Yeah .
Bro013_44	s	Yeah . ; And . ; But . ; So . There is one difference
Bmr023_843	s	Add all of them . ; I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight . ; Yeah . And now we have another percent with the V T ; That 's three point three .
Bed013_1086	g	actually ? ; Or , ; I mean , anyway , the node in the uh the ultimate , uh , in in the Bayes - net thing when you 're done , the the node that we 're talking about um , is one that says " request for location , true " , or something like that , right ? ; Um , and and exactly how that gets activated , you know , like whether we want the sentence " how do I get there ? " to activate that node or not , you know , that 's that 's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic - y side has to deal with , right ?
Btr002_1436	s	because I had the same problem . ; Yeah . That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave , ; It 's ; but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes I 'll s ry and be sc try to scan it ,
Bro024_1057	b	Mmm . ; they didn't include that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_1211	b	so . ; which is that as we 've improved our microphone technique , we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent , uh , recordings , ; so it 's in a way it 's an artifact that there 's so much on the on the earlier ones . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_851	bk	Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray , ; right ? ; but it was ; Yeah .
Bro005_1400	bk	Al - actually I should mention ; So if um , about the Linux machine ; " Swede . " ; Yeah .
Bro022_137	cc	and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . ; Uh , ; and for that ; for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer
Bmr012_773	b	I I only downsampled them first cuz I was ; I mean that 's just one line that 's one line of code to comment at ; Well ; yeah
Bro023_801	s	Mm - hmm . ; Ma ; So just th ; Makes sense .
Buw001_98	s	Uh , especially for querying . ; Especially for querying . ; So , getting people to do queries afterwards , ; getting people to do summaries afterwards .
Bro024_1116	s	alright . ; Uh ; So you have to take the whole the five . ; There should be five sheets .
Bmr005_886	aa	Nah . ; OK . ; Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think I think it 's ; Yeah , he 's it it doesn't take a long time .
Bmr002_1376	b	your you you stood up and walked around . ; None of the rest of us have . ; And so we could have wired mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal . ; Oh .
Bro017_945	b	Just adjust the model , ; yeah . ; to get uh this uh this the effect I think that you 're talking about , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2594	b	PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff . ; Yeah . ; And that 's about cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the ; Right .
Btr002_1978	b	Mmm . ; But - but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels , ; Uh - huh . ; Right .
Bmr018_922	bk	Yeah . ; Cuz then then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time . ; that you 're not gonna miss something , ; yeah .
Bed008_414	aa	Basic ; you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ? ; if we ; Yes .
Bro017_472	b	If if you are interested we eventually can tell you how " , but uh we can get fifty percent improvement . ; Mm - hmm . ; Because people will s will be saying it 's impossible . ; Hmm .
Bmr018_1137	aa	These will be things that are particular things , ; aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it . ; Detail , ; Right , right .
Bmr008_882	s	because ; Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form , i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak , ; OK , ; It 's It 's a sub - categorization .
Bmr002_511	aa	So that ; Oh , it 's very common . ; So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them ; Yeah .
Bmr019_643	s	We do we tend to do that anyway . ; OK . ; Oh . ; So , although you you can pipe it as well , we tend to do it that way
Bro013_205	s	And I could easily see that difference coming from this huge amount of data that it was trained on . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's ; You know , I don't think there 's anything magical here .
Bns002_45	bk	well , the research topics at this moment is uh , I P - eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and em eh tool developing tools uh for quality of service , eh performance analysis . ; That 's eh And we have several projects eh both Spanish and European projects , ongoing ; eh in this area . ; OK .
Bmr027_1101	s	or the exit unknown , ; not the internet unknown " . ; And it it comes through as " in the core network itself of the access provider , ; not the internet backbone core " .
Bns001_272	s	Um What I told Joachim yesterday was that , uh uh for my company the company I work for , they are more interested in in an explicit service , than in core technology . ; u ; Me , on the other hand , I 'm more interested in uh , core service , or c core technology , myself . ; So I 'm u I was thinking about uh , how I could combine the both of them .
Bed012_580	aa	In the case ; Cuz if you needed an If y If Go - there was true , you 'd wanna know what endpoint was . ; And if it was false , you 'd wanna d look at either Lo - Income Info - on or History . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1359	s	But I think Fudge is pretty fast too . ; Yeah , I mean you can check with uh Dave Johnson . ; I mean , it it 's I think the machine is just sitting there . ; And it does have two processors ,
Bmr001_322	aa	That 's right . ; Three , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr005_436	b	Yeah . We just w ; I I don't know what eh will will happen with the ; So there 's a lot of overlap . ; Yep .
Bmr024_576	%--	And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense . ; O ; Just just reboot it . ; Abort
Bed010_852	b	and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing , ; OK . ; and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_389	s	Yeah . ; and so either ; it might not be integrated ; but it it could potentially be in it .
Bro021_144	bk	and Yeah . ; In my idea , I I was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means . ; Um ; Yeah .
Btr001_170	bk	Hmm . ; So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back . ; Right . ; Oh , yeah .
Bro019_150	qy	and uh , ; uh I fired off a training job , ; and then I fired off a recognition job ; and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , " uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously
Bro005_60	aa	uh when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta ; and eighty - nine with the delta . ; a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance , ; Yeah ,
Bmr021_20	bk	Yeah , I do too . ; Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape . ; So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings . ; I see .
Bro023_138	s	The other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds , ; and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , ; and when you were six ; and you basically build up to the twelve seconds .
Bed010_254	s	Mm - hmm . ; you know what do the constructions look like , ; what 's the execution engine look like , ; mmm lots of things .
Bro017_336	s	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing . ; You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening
Buw001_2259	%--	But , um , it 's definitely something I would want to do something on . ; I wonder if work 's already been done on it . ; Like e expert systems and stuff , ; or ?
Bro007_557	b	But ; rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_277	b	Yeah , ; I I 'm not sure how that works . ; Uh , it seems like Andreas did something for that . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2171	bk	Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording . ; Alright . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro014_1011	ba	So it 's ; so , ; uh , ; I think it 's a neat thing .
Bed002_230	s	But you cannot enter or do anything else . ; Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . ; It 's just a dark alley . ; But you can touch it .
Bro004_271	aa	Um ; Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task . ; Yeah . ; Yeah sure .
Bed005_1242	s	It I mean you you can always uh see easily that that I 'm not grasping everything correctly , ; but what seemed attractive to me in im uh in the last discussion we had , was that we find out a means of of getting these point four , point five , point one , of C - four , ; not because , you know , A is a Landmark or not , but we we we label this whatever object type , ; and if it 's a garden , it 's point three , point four , point two .
Bed003_183	b	we meant , uh , touristic reasons . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bro011_321	s	Oh . ; So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? ; I see . ; But that 's uh uh all that 's is a a certainly relevant uh study
Buw001_1993	s	cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we can get anybody in EE , uh , over ; and and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW .
Bmr003_2132	aa	That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , ; Is it a speed bump ? ; So that the wires go through here . ; yeah .
Bmr008_761	t1	You know , people would say Boston , and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it was ; Interesting .
Bro024_1447	b	Right . ; OK . ; Good . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_102	b	Because uh we would fight for that , really . ; uh but since uh u u n u ; at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car ; Hmm .
Bed011_1134	qh	Yes . ; And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that module a dis disc dialogue manager , ; Right . ; and wouldn't it make sense to do this here too ?
Bmr028_627	ba	Mm - hmm . ; and in one of the one of the early meetings , one pers particular person , almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was " yeah " , " uh - huh " . ; It was just a whole list of them . ; It was very funny .
Bmr011_1267	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , ; Excellent .
Bro016_753	s	MSG is very different from both of them . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if it 's very different , then this is the sort of thing ; I mean I 'm really glad Andreas brought this point up .
Bmr031_181	h	How do you transcribe that ? ; How much do we need transcribed before it 's worth doing some trainings ? ; Oh . B uh ; Mmm .
Bmr007_357	ar	because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice , ; Mm - hmm ? ; so that so the issue is in in a situation where th that 's ; Well , it 's not really " nice " .
Bro023_219	qw	OK . ; OK . ; you know , they 'll say something first . ; And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , " excuse me ? "
Bro004_1324	bk	No ? ; Oh , that 's good . ; It just died . ; OK .
Bro004_726	s	No , ; or ? ; I we plan to start this ; uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these
Bro024_228	s	Uh - huh . ; Uh , ; and , um , ; that 's sort of what we 're doing in this Aur - Aurora stuff .
Btr001_1906	b	Yeah yeah . Yeah . ; Nice guy . ; I just wanted to know what Liz looked like . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_202	aa	The ; The train the training of the HTK ? ; Yes . ; Yes .
Bmr006_1004	b	look at at som some picture that shows you , " Here 's These things uh , uh are offer some separation . " And , uh , in LPC , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , uh , the residual ; Yeah . ; Um So . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1167	b	Mm - hmm . ; If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk . ; Right . ; OK .
Bns003_396	b	normally that 's was my my , uh ; In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example ; when I tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_738	bk	And is there any um i ; are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ? ; There are lots of w there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on , ; OK .
Bro019_1556	g	cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , ; So you just You typically just get a few roots ? ; but . ; You know ,
Bro028_521	no	but they they don't have a whole lot of it filled in ; and and I didn't notice until after I 'd printed it out that , um , they don't say here what these different testing conditions are . ; You actually have to click on it on the web site to see them . ; So I I don't know what those numbers really mean .
Bmr028_831	ba	Um , I think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do , um , a recognition , uh , pass on one of the PZM mikes for these s same meetings that you 've been gi n gi bi ; For the meeting ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's gonna be terrible ,
Bmr008_752	s	and I guess it could be done inductively , ; but if you have a bunch of , say , R - less dialects and uh you know , if they ; But even you know in Switchboard , I I remember looking really carefully at ; They have information sort of like TIMIT
Bro012_1361	b	the example that you you just ; And and it may not have been noisy conditions . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1581	b	I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels , ; Yeah . ; if that 's OK , ; Mmm .
Bmr002_1188	qw	Close mikes . ; I mean I ; yeah , I feel like that What we 're actually going to do with these data is very unclear to me ; Why ?
Btr002_576	%--	Oh . ; Right . ; Hmm . ; And , w uh v I asked c a couple of people and they c answer came back that
Bsr001_1960	b	I mean , ; except ; Anybody else want to work on this by the way , Horacio ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_785	b	Yeah , but mmm , I mean , the ; the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network ; and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . ; Right .
Bro010_184	s	What were they thinking of changing it to ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low uh , very very very narrow , uh , latency bound . ; And the people who have longer latency don't .
Bmr005_34	%--	but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . ; Yeah , I I 'd I think it 's some ; After I just printed out a zillion of them . ; Yeah , well , that 's
Bsr001_252	ba	Yeah . ; but I like this . ; Oh , yeah . ; But this is very comfortable .
Bro027_1156	bk	So the net saw all the SNR @ @ conditions . ; Right . ; Now after cleaning up it 's a different set of SNR . ; Right .
Bed013_397	s	" we wanna also do that " . ; Which is not too good . ; Might be more interesting to do something like let 's assume um , we 're right , ; we have as Jerry calls it , a delusion of adequacy ,
Bmr030_54	b	Well , the the sort of general idea was , you can think about meetings at lots of different levels , ; all the way d from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue , discourse , topic . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro016_598	b	Maybe . ; I don't know . ; I was just wondering if there was other information we could exploit . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1989	aa	yeah . ; where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents , ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr001_165	bk	So . ; But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible . ; Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say " yes , this is where we do such - and - such " , and then be able to see uh , you know , some kind of I mean it 's less important than doing what we 're doing right now ; Right .
Btr002_1378	b	Hmm . ; Because you end up p p p ; if you try to n go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge huge space of time ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1496	b	And otherwise they should mark it so that we can check . ; Mark it . ; Sure . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1175	b	Little bit of treats . ; Hey , they would . ; Oh that 's true . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1700	ba	N no nets , ; No net . ; Yeah . ; That would be great !
Bdb001_1199	2	Yeah . ; and uh , sort of like th uh , you know , you have this thing in UNIX where you have , uh , diff . ; Diff . ; W - diff or diff .
Bro024_1388	s	Yeah . ; Um . ; And eh , hhh ; actually when we look at at the VAD , for some utterances it 's almost perfect ,
Bmr015_579	s	um , ; once I test them . ; And then we 'll we 'll need to specify that somewhere . ; So I was just gonna do a fixed list of , uh , microphones and types .
Bmr028_1542	b	Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection . ; But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck , ; even though automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_1105	b	O or when it 's true ? ; but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_317	no	Well like ; Oh really ? ; so ; I didn't know that .
Bro021_365	%--	Sure . ; But on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth , it might be good to standardize on the piece that we 're not changing . ; Right ? ; So if there 's any particular reason to ha pick one or the other ,
Bmr006_1087	b	Yeah . ; I now have ten likely candidates . " ; And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_844	aa	The the ; I think so . ; Yep . ; Yeah ,
Bmr018_1010	bk	Oh , Brian . ; You s I thought you said Ryan . ; And it 's like , " Who 's Ryan ? " ; OK .
Bmr026_307	s	But , ; um Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in to people . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics
Btr002_370	aap	I mean ; Mmm , not " twosome gruesome " . ; No , not " twosome gruesome " . ; Sometimes ,
Bro004_1427	s	And you can parallelize the training . ; And run it on several machines ; Aha ! ; and it just basically keeps counts .
Bmr013_710	s	How many minutes would you want from ; I mean , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . ; And then , ; should provide this .
Bed004_372	qw	and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot . ; What 's " tourbook " ?
Bed016_421	s	Yes . ; I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , ; so . ; It 's it 's certainly related ,
Bro021_283	%--	Uh - huh . ; Right ? ; Uh - huh . ; And then
Bmr003_1370	s	So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in . ; Yeah , I do too . ; Mm - hmm . ; Their pre pre - lay .
Bmr014_1234	%--	Yeah , OK . ; How about them energy crises . ; Yeah . ; I think we 're uh
Bro013_24	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And uh it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends on on the uh uh , with the SRI system . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I th I think that the
Bmr028_1348	s	It 's even more than that . ; I think it it really gives a very strong perspective , that you know that what you were doing is not an un - biased experiment . ; If you don't say that , then people think " oh , they did that and they threw that , but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world " . ; But if you say " we did a n cheating experiment " , which is really the standard way you 'd say it , it says you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something .
Bmr010_1487	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; So those are all things that should be there .
Bmr016_2108	s	The word " seven " , OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I 'd so " I 'd like I 'd like to talk about point five " .
Bmr007_975	s	Uh Suppose you don't use any of those things . ; You say you have looked for acoustic change . ; Well , what does that mean ? ; That that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something ,
Bro012_868	%--	OK . ; because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B ; Mm - hmm . ; if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something ,
Bed004_742	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So I think that 's OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that is um ,
Bmr024_1287	s	Yeah . ; So there must be some something else going on . ; Well , what 's the standard ? ; Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males .
Bmr028_1275	s	Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem . ; It 's ; No . But if you w just want to see what ; Like , suppose you fixed some typ No , Jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the word error ,
Bro028_306	g	There 's two problems there . ; I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation . ; Uh - huh . ; Right ?
Bmr026_1170	x	So So I think it 's uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours . ; Thirty hours . ; Thirty hours per gender . ; I 'm not sure what this 'll mean .
Bmr026_239	%--	oh Nope . ; But I definitely will do that . ; So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this ; Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the
Bro023_1596	b	Right ? ; Mmm . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro023_174	bk	you do you mean in my tests so far ? ; Ye - yeah . ; Most of the silence has been cut out . ; OK .
Bmr008_413	%--	kinder and gentler . ; Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd I shouldn't say that . ; Yeah . ; They uh that , you know , i if you say " Optional " then it 's sort of
Bmr027_1144	%--	and I don't want them to do that . ; Yeah . ; And then I also the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones ; C
Bmr006_1029	b	You can find the nnn , the the acoustic change . ; But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . ; because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_1550	s	Mm - hmm . ; But I 'll keep working on it . ; But the what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll Absinthe will be a good machine . ; Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors .
Bro005_1057	%--	or ? ; but on the other hand they did it before . ; Mmm ? ; Um the
Bro005_1209	%--	Yeah , so I don't know . ; Yeah , but I li ; But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we ; Well , I think My impression
Bmr031_518	s	but it was smaller than ours . ; Well , that might help a bit . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , actually I think at NIST they were ta there were there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too ,
Bmr003_1656	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by part of the part of the script or something more ; Uh , yeah , ; it seems like
Bmr025_533	co	on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , ; Yeah . ; Right . ; you actually have to say which one .
Btr002_1316	bk	Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them . ; Hmm ? ; Cuz I would get the whole tr I 'd get the whole transcript of the meeting ; Oh , that 's right !
Bmr019_1220	%--	because even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ? ; You have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition . ; So , ; you know , it 's it 's sort of
Bro017_1044	b	Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was , ; but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company ; and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer . ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_57	s	I 've never taken classes on it or anything , ; so . I found that really hard . ; And I remember transcribing and having a bunch of ; You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was .
Bro024_1528	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and then , must choose them somehow to give on average the best results for a certain range of the signal - to - noise ratios . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1772	bk	Yeah . ; There 's tea , also , though . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro003_710	aa	Or is that ; you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ? ; Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra , ; Yeah databases .
Bmr009_1180	b	because you have ; I mean some of them are very obvious . ; If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know . ; N m Yeah .
Btr002_2693	b	because we 're capturing then the communicative level . ; Yeah . Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . Exactly . ; Right .
Bmr009_1078	s	But I I 'm s I 'm now that you mentioned it though , I am really am confused by " Northern " . ; Yeah . ; I agree . I agree . ; I really am .
Bro023_1151	b	Yeah . ; I mean , they they sound bad . ; But we 're not listening to it , usually . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1762	s	go on with considerations and potential ; and and uh ; um we didn't make s much progress today in the meeting , ; but anyway this kind of activity lives from all , from the input of all .
Bro010_1219	b	um ; The first paper on this is gonna have great references , ; I can tell already . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_981	s	So ; uh , ; it I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together . ; That 's fine .
Bmr028_820	t3	Yeah . ; So it 's just , uh ; Five more processors . ; Oh , I know what it was
Bns002_765	bk	OK ? ; One kilobyte is uh eight uh bits . ; OK ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2551	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; It 's like a m sort of more surprise , or engagement ? ; Yeah .
Bmr008_863	bk	You ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect style . ; Right . ; Right , the way the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking cuz it says " Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region " . ; OK
Bns002_693	g	Of course we can choose uh our transmission values longer enough to reach from so the nodes from this area will be able to reach the nodes on this other area . ; OK ? ; But , again , we can assume that eh if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen . ; OK ?
Bed010_240	bk	Well d we we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're ; Uh - huh . ; Indeed . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_940	aa	You don't have to ; The transfer function is less errorful , ; yes . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr024_510	qy	Yep . ; um , ; Yeah . ; do those actually go down or not ?
Bro016_1092	s	Good . That 's great . ; And , uh , ; um , ; called them " avents " ,
Bro011_460	s	I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions .
Bed009_279	b	Mmm . ; Yeah ; That 's what it should do . ; Right ,
Bed014_871	%	Oh ! Oh , OK . ; Bullet - proof . ; That 's the word I was looking for . ; Both proof .
Bmr001_234	s	This happened . ; Do they mean omnidirectional , ; is that their point ? ; I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions .
Bed005_791	%--	Whether it 's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this . ; Hmm . ; But the whole i is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with , sort of , questions ? ; Uh , you know
Bmr020_580	ar	Made the font smaller and the narrows longer . ; Font smaller , ; yeah . ; No , no .
Btr002_2494	b	Mm - hmm . ; And so that ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr003_1189	s	That 's right . ; Yeah , I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard ; Six . ; but there is a standard pay scale
Bed006_1170	bk	um uh ; Every SPG every SPG action either is an Enter or a View or an Approach , ; is it change ; Right , right .
Bmr026_467	b	There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button . ; Just press Press each meeting saying " we need more disk space " " this week " . ; The " more disk space " button ? ; Yep .
Bed005_1191	s	whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . Right ? ; So you have to have just three N ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So , this is much smaller than that .
Bed009_558	aa	Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner " ? ; You have to ; Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner ; That 'd be nice .
Bed015_1166	s	so for instance , um , ; some of them seem more inherently static , OK , ; like a container or sort of support - ish . ; And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic
Bmr005_1213	s	Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . ; Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up ; and we don't have any say about it ; and it 's typically one microphone ,
Bro011_271	ba	u ; Delegate . ; That 's good . ; It 's good to delegate .
Bmr002_1424	b	Good . ; Well , I hear what you 're saying . ; I 'm glad . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_915	s	Eh , not @ @ I ; Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the ; Yeah . ; but eh I I don't co eh I don't count eh the the overlap .
Bed002_849	g	OK . ; sort of . ; So ; Yeah ?
Btr002_476	%--	or just something bizarre like that . ; Yeah . ; Um , so . ; Well , maybe it 's because they don't realize that you 're supposed to sp
Bsr001_1748	b	Really ? ; that 's pretty ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr029_317	%--	Yeah . But if you So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day . ; We also have more machines now . ; Right . Right . So that 's why I 'm saying I 'm not sure how they would scale with more machines . ; well
Bro019_138	s	there 's a lot of nice features to it ; and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines ; and uh , ; right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it
Bro012_769	s	So you have the C - zero parameters for one uh Italian utterance . ; You can @ @ . ; And I plotted this for two channels . ; Channel zero is the close mic microphone ,
Bmr007_1083	b	Yeah Yeah . ; you know , profusely . ; Oh , yeah , that 's really common . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_934	bk	There 's a little b bulb ; Yep . It just ha just hangs down there . ; Yeah , that I 've seen . ; Yeah .
Bed015_55	s	OK , so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota ; it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . ; And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . ; There there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth .
Bed012_488	bk	Ge ; Mm - hmm . ; well the the intent , here , was Where - Is " , ; OK , right .
Bro026_620	bk	And we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with ; Yes . In this case , ; that 's right . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_704	bk	But that 'd be great if if you 're marking those ; and um . ; Great . ; OK .
Bmr026_1229	h	Uh - huh . ; Uh . There 's uh ; How bi how big ; Let 's see .
Bsr001_2289	b	And they 've been collecting digits too . ; OK . ; So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_1192	b	but there is a standard pay scale ; I just don't know what it is . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1051	aa	So , ; if they occur to you . ; So , like " did the French system use Tcl ? " ; Right .
Bmr005_391	s	and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . ; How many events would that be ? ; So - I don't understand . ; So , two people are talking , and then a third person starts talking .
Bdb001_1327	qw	Sure . ; But they could have changed it a little . ; The the point is , that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript , ; so how do you merge it back in ?
Bmr010_1075	b	I I don't wanna say that by fiat . ; Hmm . ; I 'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful . ; Yeah .
Bro026_1030	s	Right . ; If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters Uh ; Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i ; Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true .
Bmr020_528	%--	uh , and and and particularly at the interruption points . ; And uh , we found that there is a marked difference ; so ; that for instance after
Btr002_2138	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate .
Bed009_160	bk	He 's off off on his trip already . ; but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer . ; Thilo . ; OK well yeah
Bro019_1191	%--	sometime it 's a little bit better , ; but not significantly . ; And ; Uh , is it with TI - digits , or with ?
Bro026_696	s	So it it 's ; OK . ; So there 's ; So , training the recognizer ,
Bro017_847	aa	uh , no , no I don't think that it would be the same . ; I mean , no , the If you set it to a mean , that would ; No , you can't do that . ; Oh , that 's true ,
Bmr028_1473	b	And so it 's just a way of putting it all out on the table , uh , as opposed to ; Uh , and it 's used for a lot of different types of data . ; So , segment whether you have segmentation or not , is it male or female or not Um , do you know the signal - to - noise ? ; Yeah .
Bed012_635	b	We we we have Actually what we have is this line . ; Right ? ; Uh , what do the , uh , structures do ? ; Hmm ?
Bmr011_140	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , yeah . ; Right .
Bmr010_1138	b	or ; Mm - hmm . ; whatever . So , um . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro011_517	%--	From uh canonical mappings um at first ; OK . ; Yeah . ; and then it 's unclear um eh
Btr001_2601	co	Kinda early on . ; No , ; because it 's it 's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface . ; I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it ,
Bro024_498	%--	I mean , some intermediate result , because it 's not optimized for anything . ; So the results The trend the only trend I could see from those results was like the the p the current noise estimation or the , uh , noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing . ; Because I 've the only only p very good result in the TI - digits is the noise car noise condition for their test - A , ; which is like the best I could see that
Bmr009_939	t1	I 'll catch up here . ; OK , I see . ; " South Midland , North Midland " ; That 's the old and that 's the new .
Bed009_453	t3	Right . ; and I 'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration . ; OK . ; Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?
Bmr006_1355	b	But if you h put a third in , you could put in the other axis . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover ; Once you got two ; Interesting . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1786	s	Well , our tradition here has always been to focus on the mismatched . ; Um the ; Cuz it 's more interesting . ; Mu - my mine was it too , I mean .
Bmr010_739	s	I mean , have someone do some routine whatever , ; and and then see if when they 're breathing it 's showing . ; I don't know if the if it 's ; I mean , when when it 's on , you can see it .
Bro016_651	s	Yeah . ; But as far as , ; I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back . ; Maybe other people did too .
Bmr006_559	s	Yeah . ; Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also . ; Yeah , OK . ; So . And that takes a while .
Buw001_1582	qy	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . yeah . ; Sure . Can you hand me my note pad ?
Bro021_507	%--	Uh , wh are you gonna do digits ; Yeah , ; m ; or ?
Bmr002_1010	b	and I will check it and try to download it ; Right . ; And uh see what it looks like . ; Good .
Bro005_557	b	Maybe . ; Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , ; but but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . ; Mmm .
Btr001_1744	s	or when it 's a laugh . ; Yeah . ; I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd it would si say " breath " , ; but it it w it actually seemed more like a laugh .
Bro022_1163	s	It 's quite a lot It 's a lot of work . ; Well , it 's not too much , ; Uh - huh . ; but this it 's work .
Bro003_2046	b	So that 's that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got got all the phones right . ; Right . ; So , if that doesn't help , there 's ; Yeah .
Bro019_886	s	It 's a it 's a cascade of two s ; Yeah , in general , you don't ; that 's right ; you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy .
Bed015_1669	b	And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever , um , you you you 're scope is m might extend out to the the base one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_936	t1	Yeah . ; There we go . ; Oh , yeah . ; I 'll catch up here .
Bmr010_1120	%--	Yeah . Yeah . ; No . You 're right . ; It 's i it would be too taxing . ; But , um , they 're putting in a lot of
Buw001_793	t3	They were they were not moving or anything . ; Couldn't find it ? ; And stored it on analog media . ; Hmm ?
Bmr003_2069	bk	let let the record show that this is exhibit two B . ; That 's right . ; " Or not to be " . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro018_804	b	Right . ; So we talked on the phone about this , that that there was still a difference of a of a few percent ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro024_1152	s	Um , ; so , ; there is u normally a figure for the Finnish and one for Italian . ; And maybe someone has two for the Italian
Bmr008_357	b	And having a little instruction sheet and say " If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . " ; I see . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1150	bk	And then it never ; Right . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr030_45	aa	Yeah , it was specifically on the meeting . ; Not great . ; So , d was that the one that was the meeting maps ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_754	s	With fricatives a lot . ; Yeah , with fricatives and with like , uh ; Mmm . ; I mean , like i it doesn't happen with , uh , like " buh " so much
Bdb001_317	%--	Man - pages and , uh , source code , and me . ; So , ; I mean , that sounds good . ; I I was just looking for something
Bmr026_67	s	Right , s ; So . ; Yeah . ; So So it 's basically one channel to transcribe .
Bmr015_776	aa	No . ; To get the pitch , yes . ; I don't use . ; To get the pitch , yeah .
Bed015_299	s	So you could say " construct of type whatever designates something " . ; Yeah . ; But that was mostly for reference purposes , ; just to refer to the meaning pole .
Bed011_1023	s	Right . ; Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . ; I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from sort of as general as argument structure constructions . ; Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase .
Bro026_593	cc	and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak Joe about or whatever , ; because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . ; OK . ; So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding .
Bro005_840	b	What what do you mean ? ; Uh , mmm , uh , I mean , that the the fact that s Well , for for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best , ; which is the English net . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1269	%--	to just trying to get the best from this this architecture . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get
Bro023_1645	s	um ; Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping ; because , um , you could just put the threshold and say that " below the threshold , I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum " . ; And above this threshold , uh , keep the same spectrum .
Bsr001_2281	t3	We ; so I didn't . ; no ; Yeah , in general
Bro024_126	bk	And and then there was two research questions from that . ; And one is the k does it still work if you just use the past history ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Alright ,
Bmr007_843	no	Um looking for uh whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places . ; And what looks like it 's happening is that the even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job . ; Who was it trained on ? ; Uh , I have no idea .
Bmr015_489	b	and then ; and and , uh uh , ; then there 's a third who 's doing a project here , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_204	s	Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when ; Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice . ; Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis ; and it would be very hard to tell .
Buw001_991	s	Yeah , I 'm thinking that ; People in the meeting . ; Yeah . ; You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go ,
Bmr022_34	s	So it didn't align . ; And that 's exactly what I was afraid of . ; And I went in , and more or less by hand , corrected it , by loading it ; I wrote a script that will convert it to the multi the Channeltrans format , looked at it in in Channeltrans and found the places where it got a unsynchronized ,
Bro008_223	aa	Yeah , so there are two more columns in the sheets , ; Oh , I guess it 's the same sheets , ; yeah , ; two . Yeah ,
Bmr003_1160	fa	What Well , it was thirty times ; Three hundred . ; Three hundred dollars an hour . ; Oh , I 'm sorry ,
Bro025_708	aa	I think you can you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech . ; But we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place . ; So , it 's ; Right .
Bmr015_35	s	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Do we have an agenda ? ; Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't uh , can't come .
Bro012_1362	no	And and it may not have been noisy conditions . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I don't remember the example
Bmr007_660	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , I don't know . ; To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls ; but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can .
Bed015_1566	b	for instance , um ; So , I guess , ; it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_233	aa	but I 'll test it , uh , sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works , ; cuz I have an extra Shure in my office . ; The Andrea mike ? ; Yeah .
Bed014_368	ba	Did it did it at once . ; So maybe maybe it 'll be a similar thing . ; Yeah . ; Cool .
Bsr001_908	s	or , uh ; So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition . ; Hmm . ; And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on this data .
Bro004_967	s	I mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four , basically . ; Yeah . ; And you have the original features . ; Which are PLP , or something .
Bed013_89	ba	What would that give us ? ; Would A be something completely weird and strange , ; and B , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions , ; That 's good .
Bro012_1485	b	Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; So you it goes " digit " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_185	b	Right . ; and so then that would be , you know , three more . ; Right . OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_658	bk	but it 's not end - to - end quality of service . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; It is only um what the gateways get . ; OK .
Bmr007_946	s	and apply another another algorithm , another approach like , eh eh detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to to consider that , eh that , eh zone . of s a small silence between speaker , ; or another algorithm to to process , eh the the segment between marks eh founded by the the the BIC criterion and applied for for each frame . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think is , eh nnn , it will be a an an a more general approach the if we compare with use , eh a neural net or another , eh speech recognizer with a broad class or or narrow class ,
Bro018_286	aa	Ah ! ; Oh . So , this is trained on TIMIT . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bed003_43	s	OK . ; Introduce . ; OK . ; Yeah , um Well , " the search for the middle layer " .
Bro022_335	2	Uh , no . ; I mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing , ; Nuh - huh . ; The mean .
Bmr024_221	s	OK . ; Hmm . ; maybe he 's gone , ; I dunno .
Bns003_172	aa	and the alumni page , in principle , we have to , ; you know , but it 's primarily my job , I believe , uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis ; alumnis , ; yeah .
Bro019_1039	2	Yeah , I don't know . ; There are they have there is no ; I don't know if they are converging on HTK or are using some Mississippi State , ; Mis - Mississippi State maybe ,
Bmr026_455	s	The b ; I 'm also using DG ; I got that confused . ; three or four meetings .
Bmr010_1330	b	I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall . ; But given the limitation in time and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists doing this sort of thing , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_861	s	And uh we could play the same kind of games with the ICSI front - end . ; Right . ; Uh , actually , the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role . ; We used to use a narrow bandwidth
Bro019_91	s	And um , ; uh , we ordered uh , SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , ; and um , ; I 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in ,
Bmr001_760	qw	Yeah . ; Right . ; So the only thing we 'll have to be careful with is that they 're ; well , what are they listening to ?
Bro027_106	aa	From zero to four K . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz . ; Right ,
Bns002_679	s	First point , what we have proposed is a way to obtain the transmission range uh for uh for an escenario where we know the number of nodes ; and the area of deployment , we have a a fixed area , where we deploy all the nodes , ; we have a fixed number of nodes , ; and , uh we assume that these nodes are moving freely around this this area
Bro019_1583	aa	This is from synthetic speech , ; or ? ; It 's Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1967	b	Like ; Yes . ; Hey , what a good idea . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1933	s	Together ? ; I mean , at the same time ? ; No . ; Oh , you haven't !
Bro011_600	b	So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . ; So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from . ; Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_1084	%--	So , um , we 're supposed to ; I mean we 're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location , right ? ; actually ? ; Or ,
Bed008_939	bk	Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ? ; Could be , ; yeah . ; Right .
Bmr001_302	aa	Well . ; Yep , yep . ; For those those we can make several several more of these and then we can have actual recording with you know three P D ; Yeah .
Bro005_978	b	So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this this could be could help could help perhaps to reduce language dependency ; and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . ; So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1735	%--	That might be a little unfair . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; I 'm sure if we uh ,
Bmr010_1248	b	More data is good . ; OK . ; So so I 'd like to do that . ; Yeah . Sure .
Bmr016_2068	ba	It would probably be safer , if you 're willing , to have a separate tag ; just because um , then we know for sure . ; And we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing . ; But you 're right ,
Bmr014_1134	%--	and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line . ; Well I s ; But I don't know how else to do it . ; I also have this
Bro003_1186	s	because , well , the TI - digits test data is about , uh how many hours ? ; Uh , th uh , thirty hours of speech , I think , ; It 's a few hours . ; something like that .
Bns002_371	s	OK ? ; but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet between neighboring nodes , ; Yeah . ; and you send afterwards the data .
Bro025_625	%--	So it 's , like , where do we want to put the VAD ? ; Uh , it 's like ; Can you use the same net to do both , ; or ?
Bmr013_18	b	Filtering for what ? ; For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . ; It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . ; Uh - huh .
Bed014_1443	ba	and they tell you what ; It 's amazing . ; It 's so much fun . ; Yeah , it 's so good .
Bmr005_1453	s	And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio . ; Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but ; Mm - hmm . ; You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .
Bns002_1582	s	and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS . ; There is no so much different . ; Um . You always have the SGSN and UMTS , ; they are called three - GSGSN .
Bmr003_1715	bk	Right . ; Good . ; And then , uh , let 's see what else . ; Oh , yes ,
Bmr030_382	s	Right . ; The idea is that we 're taking less time of the linguists . ; Right . ; Of the transcribers .
Bmr024_1583	bk	or ? ; I dunno . ; Yeah . ; Oh , you don't .
Bns001_1321	%--	So that 's the basic idea . ; But really it 's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it . ; That 's the point . ; And if we get some funding back ,
Bmr020_1379	b	Right . ; and then we can flag those later . ; They they ; Yeah .
Bed010_583	b	I think ; Carroll , ninety - three . ; Um . I There is a a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem . ; Hmm .
Bmr011_1664	bk	" If you 're really angry at someone use our conference room . " ; Uh , the business school might be good . ; I actually spoke with some students up there ; Oh , OK .
Bro019_1504	%--	You you actually been ; Uh , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were you were mentioning . ; Is that that something worth talking about , ; or ?
Bro005_734	no	or just like nnn , no high - pass filter ; Yeah , probably . ; or Mmm . ; Yeah . My But I don't know .
Btr002_1813	%	No ! ; Let 's not make things hard on ourselves later . ; I know . ; Yeah .
Btr001_72	b	Is ; Yeah . ; also . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_91	aa	We 're recording , ; OK . ; OK , ; so we are recording .
Bmr002_218	co	OK . ; So , I 'm I 'm on uh number four with the microphone around my neck ; and I will read these . ; So you wanna pause briefly between each one
Bns003_142	bk	Full . ; but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know . ; A restricted in . ; Not .
Bro024_1507	s	But maybe if you does do it before you get less of these funny - looking things he 's drawing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; So before it 's like adding this , col to the to the o exi original
Bmr029_795	b	and then I thought I was doing the wrong thing ; and I stopped . ; And it shouldn it shouldn't take that long to do . ; Mmm . OK .
Bmr028_441	b	Yeah . You can search for " beep " or " bleep " . ; So . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bed009_1004	b	But let me give you a very short version of this . ; So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning . ; It 's called the " route planner " or something . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_567	%--	but they keep , uh , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech . ; And they keep the speech pauses also . ; Um , ; and the overall improvement over the MFCC baseline
Bro012_1148	%--	Right . ; But , ; yeah . ; When you have noise there is no
Bro012_22	s	But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there . ; So . ; So there was a question of whether we should change things here , ; whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that
Bmr016_2245	b	Yeah . I 'm doing it myself . ; I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels , ; like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information . ; Mm - hmm .
Bdb001_1227	aa	But this is exactly what I mean , is that that the problem i ; Yeah . ; You just have to know wha what to tie it to . ; Yeah ,
Bmr007_430	s	Well , here I have a question . ; that would be interesting to know . ; See , I mean , i i le let me t ; I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? "
Bmr028_1540	s	Interesting . ; Actually , I think of cheating as a way to do some work , where you can't address all of the computational tasks . ; Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection . ; But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck ,
Bsr001_1851	b	Yeah . ; Yes , ; absolutely . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1537	b	Huh . ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro027_198	s	Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , ; seventeenth ? ; Yeah , I don't know if he 's before ; It might even be in a week .
Bro024_1324	aa	Yeah . ; We we had another system with u ; So it was a f f a phonetic classification system for the Italian Aurora data . ; Yeah .
Bro018_46	%--	Mm - hmm . ; and also R - zero , ; the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function . ; That is like the energy with these three feature ,
Bed005_239	s	Sorry . ; And , um ; you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ? ; Yeah , I mean I changed those sentences to make it , uh , more , uh , idiomatic .
Bed003_1742	qy	You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something . ; Although he might cause problems ; but . ; So , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection totally ready determined ?
Bro024_1718	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah , ; or some silence probability from the VAD if you have
Bmr025_698	s	Um . ; But ; My opinion on it is , ; first , I never take notes anyway
Bro028_259	s	because then in some cases we have the same noises in for training the network than the noises that are used for testing , ; Right . ; and ; So we have t n uh , to try to get rid of these this problem .
Bro024_499	s	So the results The trend the only trend I could see from those results was like the the p the current noise estimation or the , uh , noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing . ; Because I 've the only only p very good result in the TI - digits is the noise car noise condition for their test - A , ; which is like the best I could see that ; uh , for any non - stationary noise like " Babble " or " Subway " or any " Street " , some " Restaurant " noise , it 's like it 's not performing w very well .
Bmr009_1435	s	N E ; Yeah . ; You could say Liverpool . ; Liverpuddlian .
Bro016_808	qw	So your your ; the values that are are actually being fed into HTK . ; Mm - hmm . ; What do they look like ?
Bmr028_1458	s	It 's almost like , you know , resentful of the data , resentful of the , um , the hard work that 's going into preparing the data ; Well ; is ; No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating .
Bro024_1621	fa	Mm - hmm . ; d Does latency ; i ; Sorry .
Bed011_622	s	Yep . ; OK . ; Um . ; I mean this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing .
Bsr001_364	t3	It 's kind of , uh , ; and . ; I mean , ; apical - alveolar kind of thing .
Bmr010_1143	aa	I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do , ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1270	s	There will be a fifth generation , I 'm sure . ; And then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network , ; if you ever really full I uh uh full I P , end to end . ; But nevertheless you can only not only focus on " OK , I provide this mechanism "
Bro012_1206	s	you from that you you estimate ; or you estimate fine harmonic structure , ; whichev ; ei either way ,
Buw001_1833	%--	We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . ; And so it depends , ; w e e e ; they 're you know , they 're p m
Bmr011_424	s	So those are just a little couple of news items . ; Can I ask one thing ? ; Uh , so , um , ; Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , uh , microphone arrays .
Bmr016_1270	%--	and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . ; So then it just an ending curly brace there , ; or is there something else in there . ; Oh yeah , so i e this would
Buw001_1338	s	Well , I That 's hard to generate ; Do we ; Mm - hmm . ; and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for .
Bro014_1047	b	So we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank , ; mmm Yeah , it 's linear . ; Mmm . ; Oh .
Bmr018_1455	s	So . ; yeah . ; Well , I like the idea that Adam had of of , um , z maybe generating minutes based on some of these things that we have ; because it would be easy to to to do that
Btr002_3173	b	Right . ; Does have a meaning . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_796	%--	Or , " having " is also , um , associated with location , ; Yeah . Yeah . ; right ? ; so if the film left ,
Bed006_727	aap	This is ; Right . Currently . ; OK . ; Currently .
Bro005_242	b	Ninety . ; Yeah . ; Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_272	d	I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list , ; and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff . ; I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that . ; TI - digits was ?
Btr002_2808	s	Uh - huh . ; Uh , and also I I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying . ; Hmm ! ; A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something that , uh , will not really be heard .
Bed012_506	s	Right ? ; But in this case if we say , " definitely he doesn't want to go there . He just wants to know where it is . " ; or let 's call this this " Look - At - H " ; He wants to know something about the history of .
Bns001_371	%--	But nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible , that you could set up a certain kind of mini - database how to deal with all these kind of things . ; I think that 's not a problem . ; But uh what I I would like to ask Wilbert here , and we discuss it yesterday , " Is it only the usage of that PCMCIA card where you have instead of GSM today , UMTS , and instead of wireless LAN today also wireless LAN . ; Remember your four and one card uh concerning um ,
Bed008_98	b	because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance ; but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro014_1434	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_670	s	How about you , Sunil ? ; So , um , I 've been , uh , implementing this , uh , Wiener filtering for this Aurora task . ; And , uh , ; I I actually thought it was it was doing fine when I tested it once .
Bmr015_686	s	Yeah . ; I I 'm continue working with the mixed signal now , after the the last experience . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; And and I 'm tried to to , uh , adjust the to to improve , eh , an harmonicity , eh , detector that , eh , I I implement .
Bmr003_1161	s	Three hundred . ; Three hundred dollars an hour . ; Oh , I 'm sorry , ; three hundred .
Bns001_332	s	If connection is lost , I am I 'm not sure if sometimes you 'd simply have to drop a connection . If you have outstanding connections . ; What ; Yeah . ; But that 's uh one thing of the internet ,
Bed015_473	bd	you know , having it both ways , right ? ; Yeah . ; So , i i ; Yeah . No , I think I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details
Bmr019_1137	%--	But but that just ; Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a the word " spurt " originally , ; Here @ @ ; and so I
Bed010_624	s	Um . If you wanna have a ; This is usually um ; I should there should be an " L " , though . ; Well actually you have only have two choices .
Bro026_944	b	I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . ; Yeah . ; And you 've been thinking about it more now , ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1260	s	It um ; Uh , we should count out ; how many more digits to forms do we have back there ? ; There were quite a few .
Bed011_707	b	I mean there are hikes that you can't get to , ; but ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr007_542	s	huh ? ; Um no , when when when there 's backchannel , I mean , just I was just listening , and and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like , um the backchannel happens when , you know , the pitch drops and the first person ; Oh . ; and a lot of times , the first person actually stops talking and then there 's a backchannel and then they start up again ,
Bmr003_540	s	Let 's . ; OK , ; so since that 's what we 're talking about . ; What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called " Transcriber "
Bmr014_403	b	right ? ; It 's one token from the from the corpus . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_2059	d	Do you want to say something about that , that it works , right ? ; I was just checking like , when we wanna , um , get the posterior probability of , like , variables . ; With the ; You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ?
Bns002_1330	s	So the main idea , the driving force here , is to uh try to obtain uh , let 's say , hybrid mode ; which allows an adaptor to work either in the access point or in the eh in the ad - hoc mode in a seamless way . ; and to include in every single node driver , ; this forwarding or helper uh forwarding mechanism that will allow to extend the wireless coverage without a need of buying a lot of access points
Bmr010_508	s	Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is , ; But . ; Mm - hmm . ; but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the on the overall
Bmr018_477	s	and , ; um , might be nice , cuz we save those out already , um , to be able to do that . ; Yeah . ; But it won't work for IBM of course ,
Bro023_368	s	No , what 's what 's the number ? ; Uh , so I I don't have that number here . ; OK , OK , OK , ; I have it here .
Bed010_325	s	The answer seems to be uh , " no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do " . ; And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . ; So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , ; and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh hopefully a belief - net that does these things .
Bed014_1277	s	Yeah . ; I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , um , Keith and Keith and me , ; but um ; like in th the meeting I mean , he sort of I thin like the last meeting we had , I think we were all very much part of it
Btr001_1199	b	That 's fine too . ; Yeah . ; OK , good . ; Hmm .
Bro022_327	b	OK . ; Well , I don't understand then . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bro010_707	s	What do you mean ? ; Just cheat ; You 're saying , cheat . ; But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm .
Bed014_1121	qh	And , um . ; Sounds good . ; Someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the " where is X " construction , ; which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ?
Buw001_2257	s	so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it ; because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project . ; But , um , it 's definitely something I would want to do something on . ; I wonder if work 's already been done on it .
Bro019_905	s	Oh , the colored noise ; Yeah . ; uh ; the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices .
Btr002_2707	s	So . ; Yes they do . ; Yeah , the shyer ones sometimes will laugh i with the breath - laugh . ; And you can see it .
Bed015_660	s	Anyway , so ; I think the the " designate " that we have in terms of meaning is really the " highlight this thing with respect to everything else " . OK ? ; Right . ; So this is what what it means .
Bed002_1353	s	and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . ; We can do that as well . ; Uh , is that OK ? ; Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower .
Bmr015_221	aa	but ; Not very frequently ; but th ; no
Bro018_26	s	And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that ; and only have result with with the MLP with the three output . ; And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output . ; And , well , the result are li a little bit better , but more or less similar .
Bmr019_439	bk	It 's great . ; So the To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this . ; No this way . ; Yeah .
Bed011_737	s	right , ; Right . ; anyway . ; Scooters ,
Bro014_1276	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; but whenever you smooth you lose something , ; so the question is have you lost something you can you use ?
Bed015_1486	b	and the ; Ah ! ; Right , so the constructions might of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_431	g	but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed . ; Mm - hmm . ; that 's very nice , ; huh ?
Bro018_542	bk	You know . The idea is with a with a very simple statistical structure , could you could you uh at least verify that you 've chosen features that are sufficient . ; Yeah . ; OK , and you were saying something starting to say something else about your your class project , or ? ; Oh .
Bro021_0	bk	 ;  ;  ; OK .
Bed017_394	s	and uh , ; I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems ; and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that ; and uh As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes ,
Bmr027_1006	s	Right ? ; Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five . ; D d So , does Washi - does does UW wanna u do this wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ? ; Uh , for recognition .
Bmr024_272	%--	I mean Correcting . ; Correcting . ; We 'll we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections . ; And I you know , I 've also d uh , discovered
Bmr026_1059	b	I mean . I think I agree with Ad ; I mean basically you would then You proceed with the embedded training . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_1690	b	So actually I 'm not sure ; I would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system . ; Like I know the whole thing is like intention lattice , or something like that , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1595	bk	Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . ; eee , ; OK . ; OK .
Bed011_696	%--	H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ? ; I mean in terms of the interesting bits . ; There 's lots of bits where you don't really ; I 've only ev was there ten years ago , for a day , so I don't remember , but .
Bro022_111	cc	Look at ; then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . ; That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . ; And then and then reiterate .
Bro003_547	t3	Oh , ; um , right . ; Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six . ; Sixty - one .
Bro004_1062	no	uh for example , LDA filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . ; Yes . ; And maybe for the Italian , for the TD TE on for Finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set . ; Yes , I don't know .
Bed005_159	aap	That 's what you need . ; OK . ; And the t and the time , right ? ; If if you 'd add add Today and Evening , it 'll add Time or not .
Bmr027_207	qo	So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record . ; We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released . ; Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult . ; What else can we do ?
Bmr025_652	b	but burning them for backup is not a good idea . ; I see . ; Cuz th they they fail after a couple years . ; OK .
Bmr008_1659	%--	And and what this says is that th that without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And so I mean coming back to Jose 's question ,
Bed011_832	b	or you say " I just want to spend enough " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2792	bk	Yes , ; Right . ; there you go . ; OK .
Bro004_1311	%--	We ; Yeah . ; Yeah , well . ; But
Bmr003_605	s	And I think that 's probably the right way to do it . ; Um , it will require a post pass , ; I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly , ; but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one .
Bmr024_951	bk	I think th ; um , ; we can already put them on tape . ; OK .
Bmr012_482	s	Uh - huh . ; Like Trent Lott must have been from ; uh because ; I guess Switchboard was before
Bed014_1183	s	Yeah . ; So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , ; but I mean obviously like these the the question one , ; since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um run with that ,
Bed003_1316	aa	Um , nothing comes to mind . ; Without thinking too hard . ; Um , maybe , ; yeah of course ,
Bed015_1852	co	y uh , no end of things th that that , you know , we don't deal with . ; But it ; And ; Go ahead .
Bed013_271	%--	You know ? He - he 's usually here . ; Tsk . ; Here in the group ? ; J J Jer - Jerj
Bmr010_537	s	so types of overlap ? ; What you you ; Yeah . ; Um , so at a meeting that wasn't transcribed , we worked up a a typology .
Bns003_46	s	Uh I will ; So so the first , uh uh , box , this morning . ; I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box , ; and I 'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box .
Bmr002_703	bk	Well , to get to get the r to get the actual transcript , I think we 'll do OK ; because of because of the separate channels . ; Oh , that 's true . ; Right .
Bro019_1540	aa	Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle , ; don't they , ; to sort of ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
Bsr001_1818	b	yes , @ @ you 'll be fine . ; I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1310	ba	Now , you were saying that they they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff . ; Yeah . ; So we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech - nonspeech detection works well , ; But EDU is great .
Bsr001_1060	b	But we really should move into the you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real scenario . ; Hmm . ; And that that 's a way to improve . ; Right .
Bns001_1637	s	that it is a little bit more evol evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network , I would like to say . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet . ; That 's the basic idea ,
Bmr020_1873	bk	Yeah . ; OK . ; Sample it , rather . ; Alright .
Bmr011_37	s	OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . ; OK , so let 's talk about that a bit . ; I mean , that was ; Uh , @ @ tuss close talking mikes ,
Buw001_394	b	Well ; But , I think it would give ; That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_870	b	Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it . ; Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , um , is in the record . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1020	s	What 's th u w in what respect ? ; Loading the long ; They loaded they loaded the long long files into X Waves . ; No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem .
Bro024_565	s	Uh , actually the noise compensation whatever , uh , we are put in it works very well for the high mismatch condition . ; I mean , it 's consistent in the SpeechDat - Car ; and in the clean training also it gives it ; But this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech .
Bro005_238	s	Oh this is accuracy ! ; Yeah . ; Oy ! OK . ; Uh , so we have nine nine let 's say ninety percent .
Btr002_1046	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1439	%--	we should go beyond , uh , ICSI ; but , I mean , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's just
Bmr024_1479	%--	I 'll re - generate my initial alignments . ; Then I 'll get much better models at the end . " ; Made no difference whatsoever . ; It 's I think it 's eh , i
Btr002_277	b	I might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt interrupted or something , ; Mm - hmm . ; or I would maybe even act as though they were , um , just trailing off . ; Right .
Bro019_1413	s	Yeah . ; So , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is ,
Bed002_474	b	No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th ; What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . ; All it has is some really crude stuff saying , " A person wants to go to a place . " ; Right .
Bmr023_1232	bk	cuz I need to save the data and , um , get a call . ; Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Buw001_542	b	I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing ; because writing takes time ; and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_525	s	Not not unless you really really want to . ; They 're very dependent ; Not unless you really want to . ; And they 're both nice guys
Bmr022_1251	s	If they 're ac if they 're so closely linked that they 're actually modifying transcripts and " key " files , then they could do it by , you know , secure - shelling into ICSI , under RCS , at that point . ; Ye - well , I don't see a real difference between RCS and any other system . ; I mean , it 's just mechanisms . ; The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying
Bmr010_1156	s	Cuz this is , you know we 've got a good interface , ; we 've got great headphones , m ; um ; It could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something .
Bmr003_322	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , ; the the acoustics of this room . ; Including the fan .
Bmr012_1280	%	OK . ; So maybe we could they could have a meeting more or less without us that to do this and we should record it ; and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you know could tell us about it . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_941	s	This this is the idea . ; And if , if you do that , eh eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh of distance in a first step , and then you , eh you get the , eh the hypothesis to the this change acoustic , eh to po process ; Right . ; Because , eh eh , probably you you can find the the eh a small gap of silence between speaker with eh eh a ga mmm , small duration Less than , eh two hundred milliseconds for example
Bmr014_510	s	And um , ; and so they 'll be a difference in commas , ; but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . ; And I have t ten minute stretch where I can where I can show that .
Bed005_1204	ar	I don't know . ; So , really , i What a A Noisy - OR seems to kind of " neural - net - acize " these Bayes - nets ? ; Eh well to some ; No , no .
Bsr001_2566	g	Mmm . ; Right . ; It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way . ; Doesn't it ?
Bdb001_900	s	Mm - hmm . ; like the slope of something . ; But ; you know , we 'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh , either at the word - level or at the segment - level ,
Bmr016_1761	qw	Well both . ; We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model . ; Oh lan Oh OK - we OK ; Add what , Liz ?
Bmr009_1195	b	But is Boston New England ? ; And they 're proud of it . ; day o ; Yeah .
Bns002_1180	s	and in this second case , communication happens f eh um from one computer to the other at the link ly layer . ; OK ? ; So , if I want to connect to uh , let 's say , Miguel 's , uh Michael 's , uh I I will send him a packet , ; and he will receive it , and that 's it .
Bro024_327	b	Well , they have companies ; and they don't tell other people exactly what they do . ; But but I mean , when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this . ; R right .
Bro018_663	aa	or ? ; Oh it i ; Oh , so it is a sigmoidal . ; Yeah .
Buw001_934	s	That 's true . ; So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . ; Yeah , I 'm not sure . ; I think it it it will again depend on Landay ,
Bmr007_1177	s	Wh - what is " audio pixelization " ? ; Uh , audio pix wh he did it , ; so why don't you explain it quickly ? ; It 's just , uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting
Bmr001_310	%--	Right . ; Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh ; uh OK maybe you th you 're the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart , ; but what if you have two of these things ?
Bmr018_1060	g	Oh . ; I don't think that would work , ; No , it ; right ?
Bmr005_277	s	you know . ; Yeah . ; Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark ; Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .
Bro005_805	bk	Um . ; Yeah . So , the the reason Yeah , the reason is that the perhaps the target the the task dependency the language dependency , and the noise dependency ; So that 's what you say th there . ; I see .
Bmr008_1508	b	because it 's it 's this this has to do with these questions of harmonicity , and so forth , ; OK . ; So if we could , or if you could do some of it , ; Yeah .
Bro024_167	s	Uh , I wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds . ; And it seemed like he chose it a bit informally . ; So , um , ; with the with the HTK set - up I should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length ,
Bro010_1002	no	I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . ; The - these same people ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't remember that .
Bmr019_789	s	G given I I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better . ; Mm - hmm . ; I looked at them . ; I spent two days um , in Waves
Bmr005_804	b	It 's OK . ; and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple . ; It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_610	s	Yeah . I think it 's better . ; and when there is s something in between , I con I I do not concatenate them . ; Oh , right . Oh , that 's ; The longer is better .
Bmr027_1148	s	because of the problem of low gain in the originals . ; And and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , ; and actually I I mean , I I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . ; We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets
Bed004_769	%--	And I don't yet see how that goes . ; Alright . ; There 're no primitives upon which uh ; u u What are the primitives , and how do you break this
Bed012_699	bk	Pasta . ; He 's just visiting . ; Hmm ? ; Right .
Bed003_822	%--	Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ? ; Whether it 's practically speaking enterable , or actually physically enterable or not ? ; It seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wanna go into it or not . ; y y If If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m
Bed005_964	s	so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , uh , what he 's doing . ; It 's just a little embarrassing ; cause all this was in his thesis ; and I was on his thesis committee ,
Bed010_173	bk	So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . ; And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement . ; That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months , ; Oh OK .
Bed009_1094	b	OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place ; and that 's their goal ; and there will be additional situational information . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_428	s	So . ; It 's but I don't know how high , in fact ; Well , here I have a question . ; that would be interesting to know .
Btr002_1897	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I was like , " I don't know if you 're saying " a " or " uh " anymore " . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1131	b	Yeah . ; And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . ; And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much ; Yeah .
Bed011_469	b	the person don't get it . ; I mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - A and three tasks for part - B a ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed005_597	s	Does this does this make sense to you guys ? ; It I mean you 're you 're doing the the interaction ; but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh , something where you , um ; And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it .
Bro018_341	b	Yeah . ; Oh , at the front it says uh " log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two " ; This ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1314	s	and just use , those meetings to to to send to IBM and , do the other ones . ; Release to begin with . ; How interesting . ; What 's the problem the l I forget .
Bro007_27	ba	Yeah . ; The graph , ; yeah another one . ; Yeah , that 's good .
Buw001_2263	s	Hmm . ; Uh - huh . ; Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics ; and not any of the facts .
Bmr010_101	s	So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth . ; Nnn , yeah . ; And you you might ; So there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion
Bmr029_178	fa	Yes . ; Uh ; Uh , David just ; Um , I 'm sorry .
Bmr011_274	b	Yeah . ; Uh , ; OK , second item was the , uh , NIST visit , and what 's going on there . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_565	aa	I I could get you on the notify list if you want me to . ; I 'm already on it . ; For that directory ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_840	qy	Spanish something . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; Did the Aurora people actually corrupt it themselves ,
Buw001_1855	bk	Mm - hmm . ; What is it ? ; We don't know . ; Oh , OK .
Bro012_1507	%	Yeah . ; But I just thought that was a little odd , ; that there were no two or three long ; Sorry .
Bmr029_699	s	cuz I need while I 'm running it cuz I need to create this intermediate set , um , of these big files , ; Yeah . ; and then create the finally , the mean subtracted , um , little files . ; And then I can get rid of the big files .
Bro016_180	s	Yeah . ; I mean , it 's more directly like the the language scaling or the , uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling , ; That 's interesting . ; but you know that those things have kind of a similar effect to the insertion penalty
Bro017_228	s	He 's a kind of like young faculty . ; pretty hard - working so he so he 's so he 's looking into that . ; Hmm . ; And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .
Bro028_462	s	Maybe maybe , uh , uh , without that , it 's it 's not possible to do a whole lot better than we 're doing . ; That that could be . ; Yeah . ; That 's what I was thinking by doing this es experiment ,
Bro022_703	%--	Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ? ; Um . ; Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet . ; So we don't
Bro025_233	s	So there 's the neural net issue . ; There 's the VAD issue . ; And , uh , there 's the second stream thing . ; And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on .
Bsr001_684	b	Yeah . ; I I mean , ou uh we we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago . ; and you 'll do the recognition . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_230	s	So if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this . ; Right . ; Um , yeah like you say , I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set 's OK . ; It 'd be nice to get , you know , more later
Bro027_250	ba	And , uh , they added me to the list ; uh , the mailing list . ; OK , ; great .
Bro014_734	s	r ; uh , y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , this new system is is is better ,
Bsr001_621	s	I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , idea of the the the meeting the the mediated spaces idea in general ; Mm - hmm . ; and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting , ; and will be like two kind of eh , f main functions .
Bed009_726	s	you can access this ; S so uh y we we looked at the e current pattern matching thing . ; Hmm . ; And as you say it 's just a surface pattern matcher .
Bro012_3	s	Hello ? ; OK . We 're on . ; OK , so uh had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis . ; Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also
Bsr001_2030	%--	Well , but that 's that was coincidence , right ? ; So , ; But that ; Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz
Bro005_500	s	So , an anyway . ; OK , go ahead . ; Yeah . ; And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven ,
Bmr008_76	2	So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels . ; and may need some help to translate what that means . ; How fine a resolution do you need on that for this ? ; Is the question .
Btr001_1198	ba	OK ? ; That 's fine too . ; Yeah . ; OK , good .
Btr001_1848	b	I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances . ; Mmm .
Bro026_456	s	It 's depending on the same data as the other . ; Same data . ; OK . ; So it 's in parallel .
Bmr002_192	co	So I 'll go ahead and start . ; And This is Adam on mike number two , ; So . If you could just fill out the form , ; and then later on we 'll read it , with pauses between .
Bmr001_275	s	By the time We 'll have we 'll have data so we can actually you know , demonstrate that . ; Yeah . ; Well . ; Hopefully .
Bmr003_2347	bk	I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ? ; Oh ! ; Or just something . ; Oh .
Bro003_903	s	If Not if it 's unseen . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . I mean , i i i i it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that 's at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of noise
Bro012_439	%--	and ; yeah . ; What 's a little bit ? ; Like
Bed009_219	qw	Does he wanna go there to see it ? ; Does he wanna go there now ? ; Later ? ; How does the person wanna go there ?
Bmr015_233	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while ; and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions ,
Btr002_2013	aa	Takes a long time . ; Are ; They take longer to do . ; It takes a long time , yeah .
Bro024_1436	aa	So so that means the only thing ; So so so these numbers are simply ; This , we have to ; Yeah .
Bmr023_202	b	Mm - hmm . ; So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation . ; We should we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . ; Mmm .
Bed002_228	s	Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . ; And touch it . ; But you cannot enter or do anything else . ; Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there .
Bmr008_1601	s	but I mean , if um u ; Yeah . ; as I understand it , you have you have some regions that uh um are marked , as ; You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold ,
Bed010_959	bk	and she 'll be a student as of then . ; And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , ; so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that . ; OK .
Bro014_127	b	But , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; um , but it 's so much faster . ; Hmm .
Bed016_329	%--	now I 'm not going to bring that . ; So that 's basically what I have , so far , ; and the rest is for airplanes . ; So X - schemas , then , I would like to do
Bmr011_1301	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah ; and hopefully someone would make use of it .
Bmr005_331	no	And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session ; and I I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , ; eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , ; eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech
Bmr029_820	s	which is that the you also are losing on Again , because you don't use all the data you have for one speaker . ; So , the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be , uh , crummier than they would in the large training set . ; So , um , I have to So , to make it really a matching experiment , I have to find ; uh , I have to use short models that were trained on normalizations that were also only estimated on the short set .
Bmr019_1195	s	and we kept the and disfluency dashes uh , kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; So so those are actually sort of retro - fitted into the time alignment .
Bro025_435	b	Well . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . And it ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1180	s	I mean , is there ; I know this sounds tough but we 've got the room set up . ; Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use ; well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes .
Bro004_1288	s	And now we 're seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh , look at stuff and and and compare things . ; So I think that 's that 's pretty good . ; Um I don't know what the ; One of the things I wonder about , coming back to the first results you talked about , is is how much , uh things could be helped by more parameters .
Bed013_1164	s	Or or asked for ? ; b Both sides , right ? ; Yeah , you don't need to even do that . ; It 's just sort of what what would be @ @ observed in uh in that case .
Bro017_1301	s	Yeah . ; I don't know . ; I never checked carefully these sorts of ; I know there was some issues that initially of course we d do all the development on Linux
Bns001_1421	b	So . ; It 's clear . ; Now from my point of view in the beginning , one more time , if I see the four building blocks , and eh I could speak only for my skills , I believe to derive a certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance scheme Much more uh general as it is done for for USAIA , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_252	x	Mm - hmm . ; Right , so between one and sixteen . ; See the I mean the reason I 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ? ; Mm - hmm ?
Bdb001_149	%--	That 's , the who that 's why you do that extra level of indirection . ; So that you can just change the time - line . ; Except the time - line is gonna be huge . ; If you say
Bro021_729	s	So , uh , I 'm actually , uh , thinking of using that also in this , uh , W Wiener filtering ; because that is a m modified Wiener filtering approach , ; where instead of using the current frame , it uses adjacent frames also in designing the Wiener filter . ; So instead of designing our own new Wiener filters , I may just use one of those Carlos filters in in this implementation
Bmr010_1586	bk	Y do you know where his software is ? ; Have you used it at all ? ; I yeah have . I have . ; OK .
Bed002_854	s	unless we would ; We can show it walks to , you know . ; We can have movies of walking , ; you walking through through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there .
Bed015_414	s	Uh ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So , uh , the the mental space thing .
Bro027_1773	t1	you want to train on on the nonspeech also , ; because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , ; to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . ; Speech .
Bed014_1080	s	s You said you 're busy over th until the weekend , right ? ; Yeah , sort of through the weekend ; because Kate has a photography show . ; That 's fine . So we might continue our email thing
Bed015_1061	s	like situation context , ; you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . ; And you might that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . ; And I changed to " reference "
Bed014_1149	s	Cool . ; Right , a little substi substi ; You know , that 's what text substitution uh macros are for . ; Yeah . It 's good for you .
Bed013_383	bk	So it 's sort of cognitive , psycho , neural , plausibly motivated , architectures of natural language processing . ; So it seems pretty interdisciplinary , ; and I mean , w w the keynote speaker is Tomasello ; Right . Oh , yeah .
Bmr020_1224	s	and just put them on the table . ; OK . ; Thanks . ; We start with the presegmented version
Buw001_157	qy	Liz , on channel one . ; Mari on channel zero . ; Katrin on channel two . ; Should we have used pseudo - names ?
Bro025_376	qw	And , um . ; Were you thinking of the two - fifty or the one - thirty when you said we should have enough for the neural net ? ; Well , it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all . ; I mean , how much effort do we put into making it causal ?
Bns001_1382	t1	eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible , ; Modernistic stuff ! ; nothing nothing that great , ; Completely useless !
Bro017_171	s	Mm - hmm . ; But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I don't think we did .
Bed006_243	s	and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions ; and sort of to act upon those , ; and um ; there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job
Bmr020_233	b	Also , I in the Levinson , the pragmatics book , in you know , uh , textbook , there 's I found this great quote where he says you know you know , how people it talks about how uh how how people are so good at turn taking , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed011_435	s	Whatever it is we 'll we 'll deal with it . ; Yeah , it 's not ; OK , so that 'll be that 'll be um on on the web page . ; And it 's fun .
Btr002_2932	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm ! ; It 's only been like twice .
Bed010_751	s	So . ; Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . ; Not indirectly , ; but you actually can feel the tip .
Bed016_1089	s	Uh - huh . ; Right . ; you know , whatever . ; Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits ,
Bro014_1012	%--	so , ; uh , ; I think it 's a neat thing . ; it seems l you know
Btr002_1058	s	Amaretto has a different one . ; I i ; Linguine is Basmati have the same . ; Right . And it 's and I always use I tend to use Linguine .
Bro023_914	s	and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , uh , be negative in some places . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Uh , on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake
Bro024_1946	bk	Yeah , ; got them . ; Uh , why don why don't we do it ? ; OK .
Bro027_816	s	Mm - hmm . ; That 's great . ; Uh , yeah , the next thing is , I started to play ; Well , I don't want to worry too much about the delay ,
Buw001_2077	s	Actually , th @ @ the CMU folk have collected a lot of data . ; So . ; Is that is that going to be publicly available , ; As far as I know , they h have not .
Bmr016_363	s	and so you don't get ; Same same acoustics , ; same microphone , ; same channel .
Bmr012_1269	s	Oh . ; Have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me ; that would be great . ; like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does
Bed010_986	co	I 'm not sure . ; It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . ; S so , we 'll see . ; And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it
Bro003_1899	%--	Right ? ; I mean , if if in fact that is a better thing to do , should we leverage that , rather than doing , um , our own . ; Right ? ; So , if i if if they s
Bns003_724	b	and they are they are starting as , uh , researchers , ; aaa , but this is only connected to your own funding ; so if you if you have projects you can have , uh , people working with you . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_608	s	I mean we most of our meetings are uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people ; Should we really try to have some two - person meetings , or some three - person meetings and re record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on that ? ; That 's a control . ; Well , it seems like there are two possibilities there ,
Bmr008_881	bk	I don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now , ; because ; Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form , i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak , ; OK ,
Bdb001_281	no	I haven't seen this particular format , ; I mean , I 've I 've used them . ; but ; I don't know what their structure is .
Bmr007_1146	s	What was that called ? ; The , uh say again ? ; I well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence . ; Something like that .
Bmr010_1520	2	I I still have a hunch that there 's it 's in there some place , ; but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it . ; Yeah . ; To overrule , yeah .
Bmr022_1045	s	Hmm . ; Because it it 's non - interactive . ; And so the only way to do that is with , uh S - hosts , ; which is insecure .
Bmr018_1013	ba	OK . ; Yeah , good question . ; Well , Ryan could come . ; Uh , no , that 's a good point , though ,
Bed015_2119	s	that once you ; we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , ; so we write it down . ; You query it .
Bmr003_756	b	Although I was I you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , recently was , um that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time i t pre - marked ; Yeah . ; cuz it does take time to put those markings in . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_499	%--	That was the kind of dispute I was making before . ; Mm - hmm . ; I remember that . ; But , um , the attorneys , I uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with
Bmr006_1393	b	uh , you know p tens of microphones , ; and and uh ; Oh ! I saw a demo . ; Oh , right , oh , yeah .
Bmr024_714	b	They 're actually talking ; So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ? ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2439	s	I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port . ; Yeah , ; I think what ; I think you I think it just plug plugs in a PC card ,
Bmr008_854	s	I mean , I think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now , ; di ; the whether they picked it up at the one age or another . ; pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not .
Bed005_1375	s	Yeah . ; Anyway . So we may have to ; Yep . ; This is with the whole thing ,
Bed012_277	d	Indeed . ; OK . ; So you 've been working with these guys ? ; You know what 's going on ?
Bmr014_441	%--	you get a whole list of things that say " curly bracket laugh curly bracket " , ; Mm - hmm . ; then y you know it 's it 's ; You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space ,
Bed010_718	ba	But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . ; That , you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , ; and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . ; But here 's the the amazing result , um , they say .
Bsr001_2524	%--	drag them in here , ; and have them read digits for me . ; That 's right . ; Oh , can you bring them up from the
Bmr026_951	%--	Yeah ; yeah . ; But then ; And then something
Bro021_127	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I I thought , Morgan , you brought it up a couple meetings ago . ; And then it was something about , uh , some
Btr002_531	s	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; And so that 's why they use male voices . ; We were just talking about that .
Bmr029_760	b	That 's right . ; OK . ; So so , um when you You did some TI - digits t t experiments training on Macrophone . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_850	b	OK . ; And I looked through them ; and they mainly had to do with this , um , this , uh , tree structure , uh , annotated tree diagram thing . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_586	s	Um the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on ; Speaking of which . ; the thing . ; There 's a little level meter
Btr002_405	t1	" gruesome " . ; g Group . ; OK . ; " Groups of " ,
Btr001_935	s	And then in the brackets , what it ; how it 's pronounced . ; Uh - huh . ; So i you know , " OK " is a very e easy example .
Bro014_1547	b	and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing ; and and then figure out if there 's some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed008_1491	ar	is that it ? ; Hmm , I guess not . ; Yeah , that 's ; No .
Bns002_879	bk	and finally , these neighbors that are in the in the frontier of your of your coverage area . ; OK . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro026_358	s	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .
Bmr007_352	s	Mm - hmm ? ; So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting , ; and it may be a lot more but i it may it may not be . ; Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,
Bmr009_1003	%--	Well just a little ; You know , it doesn't have all the detail , ; but you sort of ; But what if you moved five times and and uh
Bmr028_1775	bk	OK . ; Yeah . So you 'll have si ; So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh , simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks . ; A simultaneous digit . OK .
Bmr022_761	2	Which one is these ? ; There were a few people you , and like , three or four people who really like them . ; The uh ; The Crown .
Bro021_312	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Yeah . So may ; Well , the this threshold is still a factor that we have to look at .
Bed006_841	%--	And then G the same about Goals . ; OK . ; So I guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out , it 'll be under action schema ? ; Those are
Btr002_3202	bk	Oh , I don't get that one . ; Uh - huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr020_1184	cc	and she 'll just add an S . ; And in the other in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash , ; and I 'll go through and it and um , you know , with a with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category . ; I 'll just , you know , recode them .
Bmr030_200	b	or ? ; Oh ! OK . ; So . ; Hmm .
Bmr019_112	aa	You don't move much during reading digits , I think . ; So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_984	s	Yeah . ; but jus just a couple of places , ; Mm - hmm . ; and embedde embedded in overlaps .
Bed009_96	b	and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best . ; Mmm , ; yep . ; Great .
Bro024_1854	b	Using the clean filter . ; Yeah , ; d uh , it 's much better when you we used the clean derived LDA filter . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_931	s	So , ; that 's good . ; So , why don't we just , uh , um ; I think starting starting a w couple weeks from now , especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while , we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory .
Bmr003_343	s	y Absolut ; things after the f then ; Yeah . ; This fan 's wired backwards by the way .
Bed003_1395	b	We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn ; and and the turn before that or you know ; how deep we want to search ; OK .
Bmr015_328	b	Yeah . ; It 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_925	b	and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer . ; Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to English . ; Right . ; Right .
Bns002_321	qw	OK ? ; Yeah . ; I didn't get it . ; Um , what happened when I sent an RTS packet ?
Bmr030_333	s	And ; but the actual coding of the ; And the ; the math was done somewhere else .
Bmr027_1033	b	You know , she was uncertain about that . ; OK . ; So she 's right to be uncertain . ; Oh . OK .
Bmr013_960	s	I mean it 's probably good enough for force - alignment . ; If it 's not then we 're really then we def definitely ; Yeah . ; uh , but for free recognition I 'm it 'll probably not be good enough .
Bro013_756	s	they they write down OH . ; or they write down ZERO ; a and they and they each have their own pronunciation . ; Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the " O " .
Bns002_852	s	because eh usually when you send a a a a frame , you will want to some kind of acknowledgement back . ; So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS , well , this takes longer than just a link layer uh , extra packet . ; That , of course uh is also contemplated in this eh packet length length or included in the RTS and CTS packets , ; so , eh , you know , everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted by the receiver .
Bro022_667	s	So ; Yeah . ; The only difference is the features , right now , ; He 's doing some different things .
Bmr024_102	b	Sharing them with the UW folks . ; Sharing them . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr003_373	s	that 's right . ; Or ; Yeah , sort of r r ; got to finish this meeting .
Bmr006_523	%	So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , ; I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh , Broadcast News . ; and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it . ; Eleven ?
Btr001_284	bk	Oh . ; So . ; Oh yeah , ; OK .
Bmr029_119	s	Well , that 's only male . ; Or or or was that only male ? ; Uh . Actually , I don't know . ; I 'd I I can look it up .
Bmr026_892	%	That 's right . ; But um . ; So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1556	s	and the one we came up with is Friday two - thirty ? ; three ? ; What was it ? ; You have class until two ,
Bmr024_631	%--	What they ; or , is is that our data which we are collecting here , ; We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did . ; or ?
Bmr005_986	ba	uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , ; and we 're recording those , ; uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded , ; Great .
Bns003_44	s	Yeah ! ; Yeah . ; Uh I will ; So so the first , uh uh , box , this morning .
Bed003_1531	s	Yeah . ; So by the way tha that structure that Robert drew on the board was like more um , cue - type - based , ; right , ; here 's like we 're gonna segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse
Bmr027_1182	s	but I can tell you what I recommend . ; But if you need it , just get it . ; I just ; Come on .
Bmr008_1666	b	I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is , how do you how do you W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it by ? ; Yeah . ; And and uh , that 's that 's something to think about and experiment with . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_1213	bk	to have that be the ; Well yeah , but you can't dep ; I mean , most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though . ; Yeah , OK , fair enough .
Bmr015_1228	s	I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation . ; We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all , ; but , I mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible . ; OK , and it 's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other
Bro003_1904	qy	And now we 're saying , " Well , how do we handle cross - language ? " ; And one way is to come up with a superset , ; but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered , ; and do we think there 's something wrong with that ?
Bmr026_327	b	Mm - hmm . ; and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms , ; An ; Right .
Bmr006_1537	%	Oh . ; Ugh ! ; That 's a good point . ; Now , if you want to , you know , I mean , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except
Bro027_1880	b	Yeah . ; Well , we just started working with it . ; But these are these are some good ideas I think . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2161	bk	OK . ; Th ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Btr001_1332	s	Mm - hmm . Yeah , I didn't g ever get one of those . ; So you didn't get one ? ; Oh , interesting . ; No . I 'm glad I didn't .
Bro007_44	b	Aha ! ; aha ! ; Adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation . ; Yeah ?
Bmr003_1753	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; How often does that happen do you think ? ; Hopefully not very much .
Bro018_678	no	Hmm . ; but there 's you know , it was th reasonable . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I don't remember anymore .
Bro026_914	s	Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do .
Bmr011_1735	qw	It 's like like ; Right . ; Right ? ; And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by , uh by any room acoustics
Bmr012_1334	bk	Oh , where you 're gonna meet ? ; Here mostly ; but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration . ; OK
Bed002_936	b	And is a linguist st ; and , so ; So . That 's So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_508	s	Mm - hmm . That 's a good idea . ; And , uh ; And then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us . ; I mean the o the other problem is you would wanna r do it on an unloaded machine .
Bro025_234	qw	There 's the VAD issue . ; And , uh , there 's the second stream thing . ; And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on . ; What was the issue with the VAD ?
Bmr023_870	b	So that 's why I wanted to look ; I still haven't looked at it yet . ; I I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_393	%--	Yeah . ; But in sort of honing in on these different types ; I don't consi Now I don't consider that possibility . ; and So maybe
Bro027_471	s	Yeah . ; Um ; That 's great . ; So it 's it 's not bad ,
Bmr006_1626	s	Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . ; Yeah , I think ; They can't do that . ; because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person .
Bed008_743	%--	Oh but the thing is that we uh uh we had some things that uh ; That don't . ; that don't ; The user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke
Bmr006_1197	b	Yeah . ; So , this is all pretty early stages . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1327	s	So um so I had two thought just glancing through this . ; So , one is one is that um that uh we might wanna talk about normalization . ; I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use . ; Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done some kind of normalization
Bmr021_1016	aa	We we already have visual feedback , ; right ? ; You can see whether your mike is working or not . ; Right .
Bmr031_1166	s	Yeah . ; It 's actually not a bad idea to say " beep " as a word ; because you can search the transcripts , y you know , for for that , to find these places . ; For " beep " .
Bns001_1330	qh	so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do . ; So my question is , what we want to do is ? ; Let 's assume that we have the funding . ; What will be our first and or or and second steps ?
Bmr020_219	s	Um , ; and found that the , ; uh , ; you know , as you might expect the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap
Bmr031_1528	s	and , uh , using that . ; Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um , the high like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band . ; And the third is just , um , taking a slope , um , of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that . ; So , those are the three three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers .
Bro012_1177	bk	Well . ; So . ; Uh yeah . B We should let him finish what he w he was gonna say , ; OK .
Bmr013_349	b	I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , ; Yeah . ; because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . ; Yeah .
Bns001_87	ft	so first I would like that Miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background . ; OK . ; OK , ; thank you Joe .
Bed011_369	s	I mean I j I uh e We don't have any huge time pressure . ; It 's just when you have t ; How long will it be ? ; Um I I would say maybe two weeks .
Bmr012_734	s	Don did this . ; because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly ; um ; so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand .
Bmr018_1219	bk	and I think Morgan was saying it ; Well , but I had it on I had it on this morning and it was fine . ; Can I see that ? ; Oh ,
Bro014_728	%--	Mm - hmm . ; But it has the , uh ; the latencies are much shorter . ; That 's
Bns002_1272	b	working at at eleven megabits per second , you cannot you cannot switch to another thing , to another slower thing . ; But uh even when they are using the same the same uh , um area of a s a spectrum , ; because Bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits , ; Yeah .
Bmr013_248	%--	M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . ; Well . ; Yeah . ; Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that
Bmr014_1143	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know , shouldn't borrow trouble . ; Mm - hmm . ; What it comes down to but
Btr001_2338	%--	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that . ; There 's some there 's something there about
Bmr016_2153	s	so you have that data don't you ? ; Yeah , that 's the training data . ; And he requested that there be , uh , similar , uh , samples done for five minute stretches c involving a variety of speakers and overlapping secti sections . ; He gave me he did the very nice , he he did some shopping through the data
Bed014_269	b	Hmm . ; That ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed012_584	qw	That 's true , I guess . ; Yeah , so , in a way you would have that . ; Also , I 'm somewhat boggled by that Hugin software . ; OK , why 's that ?
Bro014_822	co	something like this , ; which is should be high for voiced sounds . ; Uh , ; Wait a minute .
Bro017_1248	b	And they wanted uh to to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment ; Hmm . ; they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh including ICSI software uh not for training on the nets ; Hmm .
Bmr011_324	s	now which is just , uh , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . ; This is good . Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file ; but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels .
Bed015_1316	b	uh , event two " , ; and ; Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1412	s	I 'm still trying to you know , to get used to the uh all the ideas ; and to see that all the things are really connecting ; because this the eh most difficult thing I see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align . ; So that 's why I was proposing this this question .
Btr002_1356	s	I 've forgotten who who else did that ? ; Did anybody else here do that ? ; OK . ; I feel like I did a little checking or something on that .
Bns003_832	b	So it 's at least it 's in the same topic . ; And progress , it 's going on , ; but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_675	s	Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . ; So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . ; First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , ; there are that use bad on - line normalization ,
Bmr020_1110	s	Yeah and hopefully the new meetings which will start from the channelized version will will have better time boundaries and alignments . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But I like this idea of uh , for our purposes for the for the IBM preparation , uh , n having these joined together ,
Bmr022_942	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , something like tha with their cell phones , ; Yeah . ; it 'd be really great , I think , if we can argue t that
Bmr022_1044	s	Yes , except that the command has to not take a password . ; Hmm . ; Because it it 's non - interactive . ; And so the only way to do that is with , uh S - hosts ,
Btr002_758	aa	Yeah . ; Right . ; You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah . ; I think you could , yeah .
Bed010_485	ba	right ? ; You remember that one . ; OK . ; That 's important , yeah .
Bed002_1297	b	You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , ; some now do the house number . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_1160	b	Mm - hmm . ; um , it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , um , de - convolution by filtering ; um , except he used a longer time window , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_730	s	thanks . ; So ; Yeah . ; so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter .
Btr001_2799	s	Alright . ; Ready , ; set , ; go .
Bmr012_587	s	or i have someone look at the alignments ; uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are . ; Yeah . ; Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good
Bmr010_370	s	Someone else pays him . ; So ; Isn't that great ? ; But about the need for transcription ,
Bro026_961	s	And so that feels I don't know how to get out of this . ; Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . ; Right ? ; Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly .
Bmr002_704	s	because of because of the separate channels . ; Oh , that 's true . ; Right . ; We could just do it through these .
Bro012_18	qo	So . ; And then we had this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range , ; cuz I know , although we start off with thirty two bits , you end up with uh sixteen bits ; and you know , are we getting hurt there ?
Bmr024_101	bk	Showing them ? ; Sharing them with the UW folks . ; Sharing them . ; OK .
Bro027_1555	aa	I mean , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect ; but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_522	s	Yeah . ; And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . ; Yeah ; They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory .
Bmr003_1602	bk	but I just thought ; I see , ; I see , ; OK .
Bro018_592	%--	Let 's see . ; Uh . ; Yeah , that 's a good question . ; I
Bed006_1228	aa	This is a cate this a category structure here , ; right ? ; Action schema . ; Right .
Bsr001_1901	b	That 's not hard . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think the hard part is getting enough training data and ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_926	b	Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that . ; We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L ; but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency , ; Hmm .
Bed010_474	b	but is there a um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the with the system ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1441	s	Right , it 's because they make people feel like television stars . ; Do you feel like a television star ? ; So you can charge more for it . ; That 's probably why I thought he was the chairman .
Btr002_2631	b	I I used to , you know , back in the day back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh ; Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ? ; Yeah , that 's what I used to do too . ; Uh - huh . Yeah , yeah .
Bmr020_1289	b	But ; But then we could just use the the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to I B ; Without having her check anything . ; Right .
Bmr019_634	bk	Yeah . ; and Um . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr030_718	s	and give you a a list of all the disks that we have ; and then , uh , what 's on each one , ; and then it shows how big the disk is ; and what percent full it is .
Bro019_495	b	so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement ; where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace ; and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_783	s	at Tuebingen I thought . ; Yeah I d I don't remember . ; was Do you know something about that ? ; Tubingen was at least involved in putting the chunks together
Bed009_422	s	OK ? ; And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out OK . ; But I think that um ; when so , when you get to the tourist domain it 's not just an information retrieval system .
Btr002_2389	s	Yeah . ; Oh , how interesting . ; Yeah , just kind of , um ; And , uh that 's another thing like I I realize I do that too .
Bro024_1439	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But this number .
Bro026_209	b	Yeah , prelims , right . ; Pre - prelim hell . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_966	s	Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN . ; We were playing with putting um pitch into the Mandarin recognizer . ; Mm - hmm . ; And this particular pitch algorithm um when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros .
Bed016_174	s	OK . I will . ; OK . OK . ; OK . ; But for this it doesn't matter .
Bed004_232	ba	she a actually was uh , more uh , present and stuff than than she was in conversation , ; so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just talking to her . ; Yeah . ; So I think that 's great .
Bmr019_302	s	OK . ; The key ; So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names . ; Right . I saw that .
Bmr028_1514	2	OK . ; And I mean , and the whole point of it was , not that it was good to increase your error rate , but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things , and trying Because there 's this notion of a local minimum , that if you just have some system that 's very complex , ; and you t you you turn some knobs to try to make it better and better , you 'll never get out of this local minimum . ; Fine - tune little bits .
Bmr010_461	s	I mean Dan Dan is very interested in doing some other things , ; Right . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same .
Bmr014_28	s	OK . ; I wanna ask about um , some aud audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment . ; In particular , the ; well uh , that 's just what I wanna ask .
Bmr023_930	s	like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . ; We had something more fancy . ; It was later on ; it didn't have that .
Bmr016_1164	%--	" going " uh , " gonna " is another one , ; with just the assumption , again , that this th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider expect that a pronunciation model , to handle . ; And Chuck , you in you indicated that " cuz " is is one of those that 's handled in a different way also , didn't you ? ; Did I
Bro027_1122	aa	Mmm . ; I mean , earlier you never had any compensation , ; you just trained it straight away . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_59	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , they 're still not decided . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro015_145	ar	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; I uh , I g so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it , and upgrade it ? ; No .
Bro027_34	%	um , ; a fair amount of ; You mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ? ; k
Bro018_618	s	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; And th the ; You know , um neural net approach uh or Gaussian mixtures for that matter are sort of fairly brute force kinds of things , where you sort of you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters
Bro010_1085	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; So where it could help is maybe at a higher level . ; Like a understanding application .
Bed005_277	s	" This is the one I want to see " ; or whatever . ; OK . ; " Action watch " ,
Bro021_912	s	The ; Yeah . ; And then , ; And the noise signal .
Bmr024_1127	bk	OK . ; What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ? ; Um , it 's it 's just it 's just a utility which queues up . ; OK .
Bed011_947	bk	something like that . ; OK . ; Uh But , Eh - uh this is actually a conversation you and I have to have about your thesis fantasies , and how all this fits into that . ; Got it .
Bmr024_778	s	Good point . ; That 's that 's a ; Good point . ; But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things .
Bmr006_645	s	And so we have some room again . ; And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , ; so , you know , we have a couple weeks . ; Uh , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .
Bmr028_1091	b	since I think he did it in Matlab . ; Uh , well , he can do it in something else . ; Hmm . Interesting . ; Yep .
Bro024_530	s	which is still very imbalanced because there are like fifty - six percent on the SpeechDat - Car and thirty - five percent on the TI - digits . ; And ; uh , ; ps the fifty - six percent is like comparable to what the French Telecom gets ,
Btr002_2809	s	Uh , and also I I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I 'm saying . ; Hmm ! ; A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something that , uh , will not really be heard . ; I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance ,
Bed011_972	2	Those files that you sent me are the user side of some interaction with Fey ? ; A little bit of data , I ; Is that what it is ? Or ? ; With nothing .
Bed009_112	b	w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ? ; It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand uh better what 's going on . ; Yes . ; Hmm .
Bed010_611	b	So . ; Cool ! ; I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works . ; Oh .
Bro018_480	%--	And um then just use that in a very simple HMM ; and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or ; I mean , it 'd be on the simple side , ; but
Bmr015_149	s	Four thousand lines ? ; I didn't I didn't compute the average . ; I think the average was around four or five . ; So that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably .
Bro022_281	no	Mm - hmm . ; I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , ; because yo ; Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .
Bed016_885	qy	Totally weird stuff . ; I mean the the old bakery example might be nice , ; but , uh ; " Is there a bakery around here " .
Bmr007_62	cc	Sort of off - topic I guess . ; Cuz that 's Cuz that was all all about the , uh ; Oh , OK . ; I I I can chat with you about that off - line .
Btr002_1190	b	Mmm . ; pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one , whiche whichever it is . ; Oh , that 's true . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bed016_569	b	Yeah . ; And it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists . ; So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2304	bk	but it 's I think that we 've unless you think there 's anything else , I think that I 've covered it . ; Yeah . ; I can't think of any of the other ones . ; OK .
Bmr006_1823	s	It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , ; Oh , yeah , sure . ; and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , ; and then you come directly into this confronting this problem .
Bro014_1096	ar	Uh - huh . ; at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically . ; Like which of the ? ; No .
Bro022_1037	s	So we 'll have , like , a few results where the ; estimating the ; the More smoothing is helping . ; But still it 's like it 's still comparable to the baseline .
Bmr020_573	s	and then we started cutting furiously ; Oops . ; and threw out half of the material again , ; and uh played with the LaTeX stuff
Bed016_550	s	That 's not about that , ; Yeah . ; is it ? ; No , it it it s says it
Bmr011_1733	aa	I 'm bad ; t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . ; It 's like like ; Right .
Bmr016_1026	aa	In the in ; Yeah just to load a transcription ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bed004_874	s	Right . ; so far I think it was nice as a visual aid for some things and and ; Oh yeah . ; No I I think it 's worth it to ass to meet here to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at .
Bmr003_2572	%	using using these ; And it and the f the five thousand for the wires , ; so if I 'm gonna do ; No .
Bmr012_1045	b	Oh . ; believe it or not ; and Sony only sells this headset . ; Mmm .
Bmr012_954	s	Well but he has fewer ; he he won't have more than eight ; and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , ; so that sounds interesting .
Bed010_596	b	That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bro025_710	b	So , it 's ; Right . ; Yeah . So , um , a better way would be something more more data - driven , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_133	qo	Yeah . ; That wasn't what I was saying ; but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do . ; No I was just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?
Bed009_283	b	yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Huh .
Bmr015_1154	s	Yeah , you 're saying it 's uncharted territory . ; So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words . ; That sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise . ; Yeah , and that 's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech - nonspeech detector ,
Bro016_253	s	So . ; Um . ; Um . ; We do have to do well over a range of different conditions ,
Bed005_0	s	 ;  ;  ; Yeah , I think I got my mike on .
Btr001_677	bk	Wow . ; Oh . ; Oh , wow . ; Right .
Bro012_420	%--	but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . ; Oh . Oh , I see . ; Yeah . ; If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent ,
Bmr006_613	s	I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . ; And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . ; And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . ; And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .
Bro028_783	b	Mm - hmm . ; and and , @ @ uh , possibly coming up with something that would , uh , uh , fit in later . ; Uh , I saw that other mail where he said that he uh , it wasn't going to work for him to do CVS . ; Yeah .
Bro012_243	qw	you know get stuck in some local minimum ; and this thing throws you out of it I guess . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ?
Bro023_1357	bk	Uh , y actually , it 's it 's l it 's three percent . ; Right . ; Mmm . ; Yeah ,
Bsr001_2115	%	You were also thinking about the same tool ? ; That 's interesting . ; Yeah . ; It 's
Bro027_947	%--	But but it 's It doesn't necessarily work that way . ; Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I wonder ,
Bmr028_1065	s	Yeah . ; But Anyway , I I 'd it 'd be neat to have that , ; because you know we 've been at this for a little while ; and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance .
Bro016_406	b	and ; something like that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_254	%	Huh . ; evening " Abend " to " evening " ; Capitalized as well ; Hmm .
Bed015_1822	b	Oh , yeah , do we have any ? ; Oh , shoot . ; Here it is three - fifteen already . ; Mmm .
Btr002_245	qw	" so . " ; " So . " ; And how does it change the meaning ? ; What 's what are the two different meanings there ?
Bed017_619	b	well , except for the sponsors maybe , ; but ; Right . ; Anyway .
Bmr007_1321	ft	But I I just worked off of my ; OK , go ahead ; It 's really neat . ; Thanks .
Bro003_1402	b	because they have one program , Feacalc , ; but no , l LabeCut , ; l LabeCut , but don't doesn't , eh , include the HTK format to convert . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_835	s	Yeah . ; Do you see this word " application " related to a network ? ; Or do you see this word independently ? ; That was never discussed in detail .
Bmr003_2353	ba	And how do we want to do that ? ; You mean like see see meter readings , from while sitting here . ; J just so we see something . ; Wow .
Bmr030_169	s	Yeah . ; That 's not a bad idea at all , ; so that , uh ; He 's got the memory for it .
Bed006_1746	s	It 's rad , even ! ; Why ? ; Why ? ; It happened to c be what it stands for .
Bmr029_973	s	Yeah . Basically from the command line , ; and the defining the phones , whatever you want to have synthesized , ; Oh . ; and give the F - zero targets ,
Bed013_465	%--	OK , then we pretend to write about . ; The submitting to a major international conference . Yeah . ; Tha - Which conference is it for ? ; It 's the whatever , architectures , eh you know , where
Bmr003_1470	b	Well , yeah , ; what I mean is wh I mean , when somebody says " uh - huh " in the middle of , uh , a @ @ ; Yep . ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_739	s	Yeah . ; where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , ; Yeah . ; and you can be , you know , on the wagon .
Bmr022_635	ba	In fact that 's what we do ; Right . The individual segments between the beeps ; Um , if beeps were like the segments that we get from um , the transcription tool already , that that 's what we have done , ; and it works very well .
Bed006_1109	s	I mean it 's if we can actually you know get it so that we can , out of one utterance , activate more than one schema , I mean , then we 're already pretty good , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ? ; Well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing
Bro025_379	b	I mean , how much effort do we put into making it causal ? ; Oh , OK . ; I mean , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_382	s	because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard . ; OK . ; So . So it must be at least uh somewhat fixed but not completely . ; So there just will be some requirements that are still not uh not yet uh ready I think .
Bmr005_555	b	but eh I eh I have eh any results . ; I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , ; and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_939	%	I just wanna mark that you did not read digits . ; OK . ; Say hi for me . ; Good .
Bed014_399	b	Right . I do . ; Uh , just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at . ; We 've talked about it , but only the innermost inner group currently , uh , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_256	s	Yeah , ; and that 's when you 'd start doing things . ; Yeah , ; we did the back trace at that point
Bmr012_956	s	and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , ; so that sounds interesting . ; Dot EDU ? ; As a compliment to our front - end meeting
Buw001_588	2	You just get together and talk about where you are . ; Right . ; So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . ; Culture .
Bro004_749	s	Yeah . ; So uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks . ; Doing something like , um um phonemes within context and , ; well , basically context dependent phonemes .
Bmr016_1704	b	So now , uh , comments , you can see they 're listed again , ; same deal , with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final th thirty minutes . ; OK so , um , on some of these QUALs , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_423	bk	and the zone with the three speakers . ; That would j just be one . ; It One . One . ; OK .
Bro024_840	s	Mm - hmm . ; Very different from speech . ; Still , I mean , it shouldn't confuse the ; Yeah , I mean , similar to what what you see really u in in the real um noisy situation .
Btr002_2347	s	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; And there are others that we use like that th ; which are sort of semi - conventionalized ,
Bmr014_982	s	because ; It seems to me that sending them email , saying " if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK , ; Uh - huh . ; If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password " ,
Bro005_851	no	I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? ; What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? ; Mmm . ; I don't I don't know .
Bmr025_519	s	but I think you both said " no , you 'll just use text file " . ; yeah . Yeah . ; Text . ; Um it has it in there , a place to fill it in .
Bed015_129	s	And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript . ; The F subscripts refer to the " form " piece of the construct . ; Good . ; And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous .
Bro017_1105	b	So . So . Yeah . ; That wouldn't be too difficult to try . ; Maybe I could set that up . ; Yeah .
Bro014_732	s	Uh - y w when I say it 's worse , it 's not it 's when I I uh , compare proposal - two to proposal - one , ; so , ; r ; uh , y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network .
Bmr008_1134	%--	Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships . ; I Maybe I was missing something maybe , ; but I mean this is something one would try to infer , ; but how do how would you How would you freeze that information about what , uh ,
Bns001_679	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , what is what means quality of service .
Bmr026_827	s	So . ; I I think so . ; Yeah . ; Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower
Btr001_91	s	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses
Bro027_168	s	which , you know , I I w we were aware of ; but but we thought it wasn't a bad thing . ; Uh - huh . ; I mean , that 's a nice noise source .
Buw001_1203	s	query generation , that sort of stuff . ; Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things ; but it can't be , yeah , very deep . ; u I I actually think that that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , uh , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .
Bro022_476	bk	So , yes . ; You can have DC offset in the data . ; Oh , OK . ; OK .
Bro019_1122	s	or ? ; I don't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , ; I don't have good result . ; Are similar or a little bit worse .
Bmr003_862	s	About half ? ; I 'm go ; S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much ; but anyway , enough to work with .
Bmr010_1057	aa	Well , that 's one way to do it . ; Yeah . ; But I 've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1333	s	Well , yeah . ; We can ; Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check , ; because we save all the intermediate models
Bmr003_1739	s	But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing ; you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later .
Bro027_1788	%--	Yeah . ; But ; So I might maybe look at , ; is it due to the fact that um , the probability of the silence at the output of the network , is ,
Bmr027_1470	2	Th ; Excuse me ? ; Sorry . ; Well , since last week .
Bro027_1351	b	Well , it will overall it will be still better ; even if it is fifteen percent worse , ; because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twenty - five point two five eight . ; Right .
Bmr028_45	b	Yeah . It 's more segments ? ; Yeah . It 's slow . ; Or ? ; Yeah .
Bro010_1286	%--	cuz we put that into the " key " files . ; Oh , OK . ; Um . ; But w
Bro027_1777	bk	But I mean , if you 're gonna if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? ; Well , yeah . ; But this other thing isn't perfect . ; Ah .
Bmr028_1529	s	And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , " Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . " ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , and we go we thought " Oh , come on . "
Bmr015_65	b	So maybe just talk about it very briefly ; and take the details to the people who for whom it 's relevant . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro019_145	aa	So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , ; Yeah . ; is the rough division of ; Exactly .
Bed002_602	%--	but they 're quite distinct . ; And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . ; Except to find out what seems to be useful . ; So , the the the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be
Bmr031_1649	ba	Sure . ; Uh , and I already I already said what I was doing , ; which is mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he he he actually does the real work on this , uh , reverberation thing . ; But I think it 's it 's it 's a real , uh it 's a real learning experience for both of us .
Bmr015_573	b	And so we just need some naming conventions on that . ; Yeah . ; And , uh , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr006_839	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; So , this is this is a subset . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_555	cc	Uh ; And so that 's also a problem . ; So anyway . ; We will do better .
Btr001_2285	%--	So , you know , " Blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , ; but . " ; " But I 'm not really sure ; Once again a sh
Bro010_1290	bk	OK . ; That 's why we have the forms , ; uh , even if there are no digits . ; OK ,
Bro028_196	b	they find different things . ; And , um , ; if you have , um f the distribution that you have from , uh , f speech sounds is w sort of one source of knowledge . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_354	ba	So . ; Right . ; OK . ; So that 's that 's really not not bad .
Bmr028_721	b	And just as long as we have a little warning . ; Yeah . ; So that means we can't , um , save meeting data either . ; Yeah .
Bed006_637	b	Nuh ? ; Right . ; But in English , that 's not really a problem , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_775	bd	We w ; I was gonna say that , um , you know , in terms ; So , Adam has a you know , a particular agenda , ; um , but obviously there are lots of other things .
Bro007_389	bk	Um ; Uh yeah well . ; Well basically it 's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other @ @ . ; Right
Bed004_743	s	So I think that 's OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that is um , ; and , uh , I had one more thing ,
Bmr012_628	s	and uh see if it 's , you know ; is it a hundred twenty percent ; or maybe it 's not ; maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something
Bro014_460	s	Um , it 's ; Yeah . ; Medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone , ; but trained on , like , low noisy condition ,
Btr001_1427	h	and ; Oh , OK . ; Um , ; let 's see ,
Bro010_285	%--	but . ; Yeah . ; I don't remember the exact numbers ; but
Bro018_692	s	So uh for example , this this uh feature set called the uh sound patterns of English um is just a bunch of um binary valued features . ; Let 's say , is this voicing , or is this not voicing , ; is this sonorants , not sonorants , ; and stuff like that .
Btr001_791	s	But it 's not completely blocking the airflow . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah , ; and you can sort of you can sort of keep it going a little bit .
Bed013_1081	%--	We 're not videotaping any of this . ; So . ; Uh ah ; So , um , we 're supposed to
Bmr027_555	s	Uh . If they submit the form , I get it . ; Uh - huh . ; If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . ; But that 's not sufficient .
Bmr028_898	b	You just di you just ; Well , th r Well , there , there 's only one person who it can be , ; because they own that microphone . ; Right .
Bmr016_1989	s	There 's a " numbers " tag ; Wait . ; I 'm sorry I 'm I didn't follow that last thing . ; So , so gloss in the same line that would have " gloss quote one one one dash one thirty " , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , uh , " curly bracket NUMS curly bracket " .
Bns003_594	b	That 's probably then OK . ; in principle , I would like to say you are lost for the NSA group , ; Then it 's like ; yeah .
Bro027_190	ba	When are his prelims ? ; Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . ; Oh . ; Wow .
Buw001_2062	%--	So there 's lots of recordings that ; Yeah . ; They 're not close - talk mike , ; but
Bmr015_82	qw	So I won't really know until I go through all the transcriber forms ; and extract out pieces that are in error . ; So I wa Uh . Two things . ; The first is what should we do about digits that were misread ?
Bro019_807	bk	but ; But for speech recognition , it may not . ; I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT . ; I see .
Bmr009_844	b	Yeah . ; I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty , ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bro012_201	s	right ? ; Yeah . Yeah . ; So then if you take your changes ; It 's similar for other test sets
Btr001_390	s	Sometimes ; And actually ; Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , " What did you say there ? " ; and they can't tell you .
Bed005_31	s	but we 'll s we 'll start with with that . ; In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script . ; And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon Uh , with uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out . ; But what I 'd like to do , if it 's O K , is to s to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .
Bmr024_1493	aa	You you 're not booting from initial models . ; You 're booting from initial alignments . ; Which you got from a different feature set . ; That 's correct .
Btr002_306	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_1183	b	The very very first one . ; I don't know if it 's the first one . ; Mmm . ; Mmm .
Bed008_1278	s	Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something ; right ? ; Yep . ; So we would like to do this kind of combination .
Bmr010_822	s	Oh , great . ; It they and then in curly brackets they say " laughter " . ; Now they 're they 're not being awfully precise , ; uh , m So they 're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished .
Bed014_1365	b	Anyway . ; Well , but Well . But th th then w then we have to come back to the bigger group . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed015_91	s	Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word ; or maybe you 'll have the type . ; You 'll say " I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here " ; or " I need a directional specifier here " .
Bmr001_281	bk	OK . ; Well , we 're getting some we we 're getting some right now . ; Depends on who 's working on it . ; Yeah , right .
Bmr001_757	b	Right ? ; So you just pick one , with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it . ; Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro021_749	s	And , um , ; uh Yeah . ; I guess Yep . I guess that 's it . ; And , uh , th th that 's where I am right now .
Buw001_189	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; OK . ; Right .
Bro016_782	s	But i it it it it doesn't necessarily ; You know , they could be , ; um ; Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is .
Bns001_567	s	That 's a fun ; I like them ; so ; OK ,
Buw001_2180	s	It 's still it 's interesting for other reasons . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Just wanted to know .
Bed005_1149	s	There 's just quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs . ; I i i ; No , no But I 'm saying is There There is a w ; I mean , if y if if you decide what 's what is appropriate , is probablistic evidence combination , you can write a function that does it .
Bed016_816	b	You got there . ; That part is fine . ; You got to out of it . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_663	s	Yeah . ; right ? ; And so , ; Yeah , so I was curious about that .
Bsr001_1972	s	but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; yeah , but but eventually I mean , will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know , and and and in core technology .
Bro017_909	s	If your um original data for C - one had a mean of two . ; Uh - huh . ; And now you 're you 're you 're changing that by squaring it . ; Now your mean of your C - one original data has is four .
Bro014_108	b	and you don't do anything else . ; Oh , this is a ; And then you just run . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_208	aa	Mm - hmm ? ; Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size reduced dimensionality . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro026_564	bk	Not yet . ; Oh . ; Well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary . ; OK .
Bmr025_264	bk	OK . ; Steve wro i it 's Ste - Steve Renals wrote THISL IR . ; Then it 's Steve Renals . ; OK .
Bmr003_2146	b	So it would c basically go on the diagonal here . ; It could go either way . ; So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ? ; Yeah .
Bro003_1831	b	Yeah . ; Uh . ; So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1608	b	Something more adaptive , ; But And I expect improvement at least in Finnish because eh the way ; yeah . ; OK .
Buw001_1370	no	and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , does it does the bias matter ? ; I I don't know .
Bed008_1169	ba	But um What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer ; but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of ; uh ; well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place
Bmr014_414	%--	yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh ,
Bmr016_848	s	OK . ; Alright , I did know that . ; Um , so the the only question is how much of it ; The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not .
Bmr020_366	s	Right ? ; So we scored everything , ; and I must say the NIST scoring tools are pretty nice for this , ; where you just basically ignore everything outside of the , uh , region that was deemed to be foreground speech .
Bmr011_249	%--	We do have thirty hours , of of speech , which is done this way . ; Yeah . ; That 's OK . ; But
Bmr030_849	b	A r ; P - make stuff . ; P - make magic . ; Yeah . Y
Bro022_629	bk	Yeah . ; I think so . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed005_86	b	Mm - hmm . ; In this case , it doesn't really make sense . ; Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying " I don't want to see the final transcript " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_253	aa	Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make , ; which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it ; Yes . ; Yeah ,
Bro016_579	b	Hmm . ; Just male f female ? ; at least . ; Mmm .
Bro003_688	s	And JRASTA - LDA . ; JRASTA - LDA . ; Um , ; multi - band .
Bmr029_22	%--	and do the look at the same thing . ; And in talking this morning with , uh , Chuck and with Dave one thought was to use ; We couldn't remember how different the numbers were , ; but if you just worked with males only and used the short training there 're there 're
Bro017_906	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But if your ; If your um original data for C - one had a mean of two .
Bmr005_894	s	Oh ! I have to remember . ; I 'll think about it , ; and try to remember . ; And it might be different for government people .
Bed006_1223	%--	Cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture , in this in a ; Right . ; Oh , s so it 's sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that that is built elsewhere . ; derived
Bmr011_862	s	I , uh , c I ; He still has an account here . ; I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , uh , transcription . And he and he did . ; And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information .
Bed016_189	%--	And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's only one " S " in " interesting " . ; readability
Bed017_273	s	And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not . ; And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , ; Uh - huh . ; and and or stuff like that .
Btr001_1668	%--	And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . " ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; The I mean
Bro011_756	x	Um i it 's a little behind , ; like Matlab , or ? ; it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like um ; you can have cells and you can you can uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .
Bmr015_658	s	so . ; OK . ; Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , ; just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that ,
Bmr029_975	s	Oh . ; and give the F - zero targets , ; And it saves it in a ; and then ts get gives out a a waveform ,
Bro007_50	t1	And then the KLT and then the two together again . ; No , the KLT . ; And those two together . ; Two HTK .
Bro014_929	qw	By going back to the FFT , you 're getting something that is more like the raw data . ; So the question is , what characterization ; and you 're playing around with this ; another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ?
Bmr009_1526	bk	Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches . ; No . No . ; Oh OK . ; Well . Alright .
Bro007_587	%--	uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands ; Mm - hmm . ; and and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something ; and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti
Bro004_70	s	and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well . ; OK . ; Chicken on the grill . ; Our our uh There 's a We 're pausing for a photo
Bmr031_1591	s	Th - That that would work . ; Yeah . I mean , but but the main I think the main thing is that ; Or you c u ; the You 're right . I mean , the main distinction is whether it 's voiced or or voiced or not .
Bro004_222	b	Sure . ; So if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using TI - digits as as training and TI - digits as test , ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1471	b	uh , and ; But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_724	s	Um if if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , ; I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out . ; I mean , so it 's it 's ; I mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time ,
Bed005_51	s	They also sometimes have flexible schedules . ; So , if you happen to be sort of in a non - student social setting , ; and you know people who may be interested in being subjects ; We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers , maybe ,
Bdb001_870	ar	It 's just it 's ; Well , if it 's not representing it , then how do you recover it ? ; Of course it 's representing it . ; No .
Bro023_994	b	Yep . ; Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , um , is to to put some smoothing , ; um , because it seems to to help or it seems to help the Wiener filtering ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1378	s	Oh , that 's the f the original . ; This is the fra the original frame . ; Yeah . ; So with a short frame basically you have only two periods
Bro003_725	b	We could add ; Probably should . ; I mean at least at least conceptually , you know , it doesn't meant you actually have to do it , ; Yeah .
Bmr021_560	s	OK . ; And so ; I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out , ; so I assume that 's alright with everyone .
Bmr007_844	no	And what looks like it 's happening is that the even on the close - talking mike the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job . ; Who was it trained on ? ; Uh , I have no idea . ; I don't remember .
Bns003_807	%--	And for me , myself , I 'm also very interested in in continue this work ; and so that will be manageable ; and , um , ; on the other hand there are also uh , some students or
Bmr022_445	b	That 's a good idea . ; Very simple . ; " One hundred twenty - four " ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1656	s	And , uh , it it does work very well under some conditions ; and other conditions it doesn't . ; Mm - hmm . ; And now we 're understanding trying to understand what those are .
Bro005_1203	s	Uh . Yeah . ; And CPU memory issues . ; Yeah . ; We 've been sort of ignoring that ,
Bro004_773	s	So , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . ; Yeah . ; OK ? ; But I it 's it 's a big deal to get that .
Bed008_829	s	Identified that ; Yeah . ; and so again re that 's completely correct , ; we have the user model , the situation model here ,
Bmr007_691	b	Well , we we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that I mean a little strange . ; OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other . ; Well , we could just put b blindfolds on . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1465	s	uh uh Hopefully , then we have with the money also not eh only for the room , ; W ; that would be great , ; but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial .
Bmr010_530	b	uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least . ; Right . ; I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_1149	s	you could do some normalization s uh , before the VTS , ; and then do some other normalization after . ; I don't know . ; But but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,
Bmr016_1114	br	And then , in addition to that , I did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file , ; which included n detecting things like f faulty punctuation and things ; I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt ; Yeah ?
Bmr011_703	s	I know . ; Yep . ; So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . ; We there will be other meeting recordings . We won't be the only place doing meeting recordings .
Bed002_1314	bk	Probably not then , ; cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway . ; Probably neither e not even that . ; Yeah .
Bro022_1133	%--	And ; Well , thinking about that , we we then we decide that maybe is a good idea . ; We don't know . ; I don't hav
Bmr011_938	aa	One side . ; I agree . ; there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . ; Yeah ,
Bns003_12	ft	One is related to the proposal , ; Michael , please can you close the door ? ; Yep . ; Thank you .
Bed011_852	b	Right . ; Right ? ; you know , so I assume we 're going for the first interpretation , ; Right .
Btr002_1748	s	Both . ; Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a g g greater frequency of speech errors , I think , during times of inter of overlap ; Yeah . ; which which is you can just tell a person 's m monitoring at two levels
Bmr010_466	s	So ; Yeah . ; So . ; N there was also this , uh , email from Dan regarding the speech - non nonspeech segmentation thing .
Bro005_1420	%	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? ; Yeah .
Bed013_458	%	and we we p pretend to parse it , ; we pretend to understand it , ; and we write about it . ; Hmm .
Bed009_715	%--	Hmm . ; and whether one could interface to that potentially ; Yeah , ; are there currently is uh
Bro018_556	%--	so I 'm gonna do a similar thing with with support vector machines ; and see if ; So what 's the advantage of support vector machines ? ; What
Bro019_1551	b	sometimes they 're not . ; Mmm . ; So it 's it 's it 's a little , ; Hmm .
Bmr010_343	s	I sent it to , ; um ; who did I send that to ? ; I sent it to a list
Bro027_839	bk	Those two ? ; So there is just this feature stream , the fifteen MFCC plus delta and double - delta . ; No . ; Yeah ?
Bmr006_1356	qw	Once you got two ; Interesting . ; Yeah . ; Well what about just doing it from these mikes ?
Bro004_1052	%--	I don't understand your question . ; Yes , ; um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . ; Maybe
Bmr007_667	bk	So , um you know . ; I I have an idea . ; D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . ; Right .
Bmr002_459	qy	No . ; No , no . ; So the question is do you know of resources that we could use . ; So are there grad students or undergrads or just commercial services ?
Bmr024_535	s	Actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for for the first part now . ; Synthesis system . ; Yeah . ; Um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that .
Bmr005_749	b	So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures ; such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as ; I mean there 's a bunch of things I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_901	b	Now ? ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Oh .
Btr002_3421	qy	Sure did . ; Yes . ; Good deal . ; Oh , and do you want us to mark the t roughly the time we start ?
Btr001_2539	s	uh , ; I i and he 's m e they they have this nice @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on , ; and he says , " Well , I could explain this to you . ; I have a better laugh than you do .
Bmr016_878	s	OK . ; So , I mean , I guess th the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ? ; Um ; It just depends on your tools .
Bmr006_1814	s	But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is .
Bro022_1051	%--	because that if ; some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , ; so the SNR is , like , very low . ; And
Bro016_289	s	it to me , actually , even if you wanna be play on the gamesmanship side , it can be kinda tricky . ; So , I mean , what you would do is set the set the scaling factors , uh , so that you got the best number for this point four five times the you know , and so on . ; Mm - hmm . ; But they might change that
Bmr021_614	s	I Actually I was gonna do a global search - replace on all entries at at ICSI ; Everybody will use it . ; Yeah . ; Fine slash U slash star .
Bmr007_657	b	you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn , ; but pretty quickly there 're they back off ; and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_63	ft	different size groups ? " ; Whoa . ; Yeah . ; Wow !
Bed013_629	s	Yeah . ; Excellent . ; OK . ; That 's a very cool T - shirt .
Bro003_948	co	OK , ; so , uh , ; Yeah ; something like seven things in each , uh each column .
Bmr006_1771	aa	I think that 's risky . I think that the public should be the same . ; Well , we can talk about that later . ; I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . ; I I agree .
Bmr026_249	b	So So Well ; But But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bed010_11	s	Nancy said she 's coming ; and that means she will be . ; Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . ; So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week
Bro010_1034	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w ; Yeah .
Bed002_1251	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . ; Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net . ; I guess my question was more about time frame .
Bmr006_934	b	Mm - hmm . ; Eh ? ; Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_966	b	cause all this was in his thesis ; and I was on his thesis committee , ; and , so , I r really knew this at one time . ; Ugh .
Bed015_605	aa	Yeah . ; that that that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f ; Purely linguistic cues , right ? ; uh , the purely form cues , yeah .
Bmr016_619	b	Yeah . ; or mixed channel ; rather mixed signal . ; Yeah .
Bed013_451	b	Um , ; We 're talking about this um , alleged paper that we may , just , sort of w ; Oh ! Which Johno mentioned to me . ; Yeah .
Bed014_912	s	And , um . How do we feel about doing it Wednesdays ? ; Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we have things to discuss with other people , there ; they seem to be s tons of people around . ; The only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other
Bed008_389	%--	and um I think that 's good , ; right ? ; So what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and ; in particular
Bmr031_403	s	Yeah . ; Oh , forty - four point one . ; Yeah . ; Forty - four .
Bro019_707	b	It seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . ; Hmm . ; So I don't know why the well - matched is ; Right .
Bed015_1460	no	So he 's not there anymore . ; Hmm . ; But , um ; I don't know where he is right now
Bdb001_1267	%--	so ; Well , can I ask one question ? ; It it seems to me that , um , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned . ; We 'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the
Bmr018_1102	s	Especially the batteried meter popping up , ; that was hilarious . ; Yeah . ; Right when you were talking about that .
Bmr030_743	bk	Nnn . ; So , it 's all just scratch . ; It 's all scratch . ; OK .
Bro003_313	bk	Oh . ; That 's ; Mmm . ; Oh yeah .
Bro023_1709	%--	Um , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone . ; And then I aligned I obtained the Viterbi alignment of the training utterances . ; Um ; It seems to be ,
Bmr003_937	s	That 's good . ; I like that . ; That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . ; And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future
Bro011_33	aa	I was there . ; Oh you were there ? ; With Hynek ? ; Yeah .
Bmr001_224	%--	completely irrelevant . ; Oh ! ; Yeah . ; You you mean for noise cancelling , or ?
Bed014_474	s	Right . ; or comes ; Right . ; is resolved later .
Bro024_1520	b	better do it different , then . ; Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah .
Btr002_3410	s	Yeah . ; OK , so why don't ; do you wanna do it , uh , in unison this time ? ; That 's what we did last time .
Bmr012_1337	aa	OK ; but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_697	s	" why don't you just put on a video camera ? " ; But you know , it 's sort of like saying , " uh , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , ; uh , but , uh , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . " ; I mean , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in .
Bed003_1004	s	Yeah . ; There is actually a text file that you can edit . ; But it 's ; You don't have to do that .
Bro015_221	b	or ; OK . ; I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder what they did about ; Yeah .
Bro024_1771	s	Uh - huh . ; So we need to combine these two . ; Uh , ; that 's that 's the best thing , is like the French Telecom system is optimized for the well matched condition .
Bmr006_721	b	the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones . ; The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study ; what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_1123	s	And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent . ; But we don't I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . ; So , ; you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ Adam 's right .
Bro013_449	b	and is not ready yet to use on , ; Yeah . ; well , I don't know . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1322	b	And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . ; Yeah . ; Well , we d yeah , we don't have a third dimension there . Yeah , so it 's ; Right .
Bmr015_708	s	or it 's it 's not right . ; Eh , ; Yeah . ; I haven't enough file feeling to to to distinguish what happened .
Bed008_565	s	uh yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint uh ; It 's underscore - E . ; underscore - E for entity , ; and we may change all this ,
Btr002_3395	bk	I would appreciate the " pron " , come to think of it . ; Good . ; But the other three i just so long as it 's clear to me , w you know , from the comment which of those three it is , then I 'm fine . ; Good .
Bed013_1332	%--	if not , you know ; Mmm . ; and so forth . ; Or do you actually ,
Btr002_3022	s	Well ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , I 'm glad you said that ; because , um , that actually takes a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration to d to do that .
Bns001_172	s	Yeah , it is . ; Yeah . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; Half collection of necessary information .
Bsr001_959	%--	But it 's it 's OK , though . ; I think in in ; It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know , completely informal conversational speech . ; So you don't think they they fill it at all with any , you know
Bro014_1057	b	Yeah . ; That 's right . ; And then you just , uh , compute differences ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1231	bk	at that point ; because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here ; Yeah , I 'm sure . ; Uh , yeah , I I know .
Bed006_373	qy	Mm - hmm . ; and so ; th the q first question for the subject is , " so these are things , you know , we thought a tourist can do . ; Is there anything that interests you ? "
Bmr023_656	%--	Have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ? ; Uh - huh . ; So . ; I think ti uh
Buw001_809	%--	I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . ; Um , ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , I think for I mean , for our purposes we probably will d
Bmr014_868	s	Because nob you ; know it ; There was a ; one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by ,
Bro005_1024	s	That 's that that seems like the the the real question . ; And if you know that ; So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . ; Assume that 's the p the feature .
Bmr016_1419	s	Maybe he died while dictating . ; so . ; I have one question about the the " EH " versus like the " AH " and the " UH " . ; That 's partly a nonnative - native thing ,
Bro003_1766	h	and Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh .
Bed013_1176	%--	Cuz you don't It seems like in the general case you wouldn't know how how to characterize them . ; You wouldn't . ; I mean or , for when . ; There could be an interpretation that we don't have a node for in the
Bmr019_1702	aa	I I didn't realize this till today , ; but , uh , this is , uh , Jose 's last day . ; Is my last my last day . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1561	s	It was more personal . ; You know , the n This is sort of just , you know , correcting other ; Yeah . ; I feel like I 'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now ,
Bro021_842	%--	The methods ; If you want , you c I can say something about the method . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . In the
Bns001_997	b	And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address . ; But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all . ; It 's l just a thirty - bit number ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_236	2	Oh . ; And then , um , Adam did something where , um , we converted these feature files into wave files , ; so you can display them . ; Display the features .
Btr002_2610	bd	W we ; Because a lot of people , ; Yes . ; I think we already talked about this last time ,
Btr002_2230	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens ; and the inbreath and stuff
Bmr029_524	%--	And that ; I don't know if we ; we never really ; I don't remember ,
Bro023_833	s	So you overestimate the noise spectrum . ; You multiply the noise spectrum by a factor , uh , which depends on the SNR . ; Oh , OK . ; So , above twenty DB ,
Bro027_1063	bk	so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one KLT over everything , ; Mm - hmm . ; to de - correlate it . ; Yeah , I see .
Bed011_966	bk	OK . ; Same ; OK , that . ; Got it .
Bmr001_747	s	Well , Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , ; No . ; right ? ; You would send I mean , uh a transcriber is used I mean , I don't know , assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting ,
Bns001_1623	qy	mm - hmm . ; It means eh a a UMTS service basically . ; Mm - hmm . ; Can you consider poten also in the meantime , some potential UMTS services besides this one ?
Bmr026_1019	b	Yeah . ; We were probably at least a factor or two off . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_642	qw	Yeah . ; Uh , how how m much ; time so the meetings vary in length , ; what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ?
Bed002_624	qh	Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , ; but I don't think that 's gonna be the case . ; I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . ; The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ?
Bed008_1159	s	Right . ; so even ; Those are not necessarily binary . ; S so we 're we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode .
Bmr020_402	s	Hmm . ; Um , now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this . ; We just took the old ; So this is actually a sub - optimal way of doing it ,
Bmr002_595	aa	Although , they actually have a nice tool for that could be used for speaker change marking . ; There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools . ; There 's a some web page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something . ; Yes .
Bro023_1101	%	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; plus , uh , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well . ; s
Bed013_934	b	So that 's not like context , OK . ; So this this includes the the current utterance plus all the previous utterances . ; Interesting , ; uh - huh .
Bro014_68	aa	Yeah . ; Oh , right ! ; This was the mix up stuff . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1048	fa	Um how are trained the the LDA filter ? ; How obtained the LDA filter ? ; Mmm . ; I I 'm sorry .
Bmr008_771	b	But you have a lot of stratification in any region . ; and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro017_502	s	Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; Well David told me ; David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm
Bsr001_1146	bk	I mean ; It 's ; No , it 's OK . ; OK .
Bmr011_1162	%--	Yeah . ; So . ; That 's great . ; I guess the other thing ,
Bro010_1268	d	Oh . ; And , uh , I think it 's digit time . ; Actually the , um For some reason the digit forms are blank . ; Yeah ?
Bmr012_683	h	Oh . ; I told you about that . ; Exactly . ; Um oh .
Bro028_753	s	It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals . ; It 's a , um sort of came out of , uh uh , looking a lot like HTK . ; I mean , they started off with um , when they were building their system they were always comparing to HTK to make sure they were getting similar results . ; And so , it 's a Gaussian mixture system ,
Bmr009_1146	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I guess I could try to put squeeze in a little map . ; I mean there 's not a lot of r of room
Bed004_889	b	Yeah , and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff ; l No , it was great . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_465	%--	um So , Susan E Susan Ervin - Tripp , who you know um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing ; Hmm . ; and they c you know , you can give them like ; if you give them a little bit of instruction and and make it interesting for them they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s
Bro017_1170	%--	When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center . ; Uh even when there is absolutely nothing to to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in in Berkeley . ; I 'm sure that it 's being appreciated in Oregon and maybe it will generate similar responses down here , ; like , uh
Buw001_2152	s	Well , I mean , " found " has , uh , also the meaning that 's it very natural . ; It 's things occur without any ; You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , ; but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever .
Bmr005_554	s	I saw the nnn the eh ; but eh I eh I have eh any results . ; I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , ; and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low .
Bmr003_599	bk	that 's right . ; That 's right . ; I wanna hear about these uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s ; R right ,
Bro004_469	s	So . It 's it 's the HTK results , I mean . ; So it 's HTK training testings with different kind of features ; Ah . ; and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this .
Bed010_588	%--	where 's the monkey ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , ; so I I I
Bro027_1132	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And ; is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch ; You mean the the most noisy occurrences on SpeechDat - Car might be a lot more noisy than
Bro028_925	b	Yeah . ; and ; we could put it in . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_385	s	How how many awards are there , ; do you know ? ; Well there 's different numbers of w awards for different size ; They have three size grants .
Bro019_1030	s	Yeah , OK . ; Yeah . ; I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that . ; Guenter Hirsch and TI .
Bmr006_1075	b	It will be enough . ; Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , ; so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , ; Yeah .
Bed008_512	s	it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's not either or ; mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site .
Bmr020_1774	b	Well because one of them ; Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it . ; They 'll be marking it all over the place . ; Yeah .
Bro025_479	s	OK . ; So there is no frame - dropping till the final features , like , including the deltas are computed . ; I see . ; And after the deltas are computed , you just pick up the ones that are marked silence and then drop them .
Bmr016_106	b	I would like to g get away from having only one specific grouping . ; That 's what I was asking , yeah . ; Um , so if that 's your question , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_383	bk	So , ; So ; um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara . ; Yeah ,
Bmr011_1450	%	but even there he hadn't ; What he 'd said " no " to was for the main meeting . ; But they have several smaller meetings a week , ; So .
Bns001_1498	s	If you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements , in principle , and and understanding next generation building blocks , uh there 's no product . ; Hmm - hmm . ; But it is a long term it 's long term , I think , uh work you can do . ; And it 's more related I believe to the skills
Bmr006_214	s	Mm - hmm . ; That 's that 's my point . Which which includes both top - down and bottom - up . ; OK . ; It 's difficult .
Bro012_1358	%--	Oh . ; But I think uh that 's that 's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams . ; Was it nois noisy condition ? ; the example that you you just
Bro019_741	s	Right . ; So , I mean , ; yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched , ; it is pretty much
Bdb001_219	ba	So that might that might work . ; But what what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ? ; More compact , ; which I think is is better .
Btr001_1334	s	Oh , interesting . ; No . I 'm glad I didn't . ; OK . ; I didn't get one either .
Bro017_1039	aa	See how many cycles we used ? ; Yeah . ; Then you are sort of in this mode like all of those ARPA people are , ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1852	aa	that 'd be nice to have a a uniform procedure . ; Yeah , I think if we just m send it all to them . ; you know . ; Good .
Bed016_1065	s	A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . " ; Yeah . ; Tu - stur tourists will often say that . ; I I 'm really into art .
Bmr008_1091	s	this is with reference to like the DTD , ; what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific . ; So . And it could be something like , " oh by the way , the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know , ; whatever " .
Bmr001_853	b	And then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do . ; Yeah , although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest . ; That 's what I mean . ; Yeah .
Btr002_115	b	well , and this this would be consistent . ; So , uh , it was transcribed as " with H " , ; but it was really " with age " . ; Mmm .
Bro018_179	b	That 's another thing you could do ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_241	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Well , it 's a thought . ; Interesting .
Bmr007_1161	cc	Yep . ; " Stuff " is not very technical . ; Yeah , well . ; I 'll try to phrase it in passive voice .
Bmr019_913	%--	Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah . ; I don't think that was the new version . ; Um ; That
Bmr014_1161	aa	Oh , God . ; They 're gonna hate this meeting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah that 's true .
Btr001_597	s	Mm - hmm , ; that 's right . ; right ? ; And it was very hard to be precise about it ,
Bed014_939	s	It 's OK , that ; so ; Yeah . @ @ That 's Me too . ; It doesn't matter .
Bro012_366	s	Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference ; because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also . ; So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ? ; No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement
Bmr016_1820	s	Uh , that 's what gets I I picked those up in the frequency check . ; Right . Right . ; So if there 's things that get corrected before we get them , it 's it 's not an issue , ; but if there 's things that um , we change later , then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date .
Bmr001_526	b	So that that 's on our list too . ; OK . ; Yeah , well that we can do something about . ; Yeah .
Bro007_392	b	Right ; so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth ; Yeah but ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1428	s	R I think ; but , I mean , there 's that 's a huge field and probably the groups there may not be representative of the field , ; Mm - hmm . ; I I don't know exactly that everyone submits to this particular conference ,
Bmr007_643	qo	I mean , not as well as what I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously , ; Mm - hmm . ; but you 'd get some rough statistics . ; But what what do you think about that ?
Bmr028_867	%--	and and , again , if you rule out the overlap , you have some numbers for that , ; cuz that 's yet another ; But , I I 'm just concerned , of course , about that ; Oh , I see . You mean when only one person is talki
Bro024_200	aa	Well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into . ; You could imagine that . ; I mean , it it is getting a little away from reverberation . ; Um , yeah .
Bmr011_533	bk	I mean , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? ; It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . ; I see . ; Fine .
Bro013_181	qw	What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something uh from this , ; what 's what 's wrong uh what what is different between TI - digits and these digits ; and ; What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ?
Bro014_778	qy	So does , uh ; when you say , uh ; So ; The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ?
Bro021_781	s	Well . ; Remove some noise but not too much . ; And when we put the m m the , em , VAD , the result is better . ; And we put everything , the result is better ,
Bmr016_1845	s	love this one over on page three , ; " vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place . " ; That 's great . ; It 's this , " rrre - rrre - rrre " .
Bmr018_1077	s	Yeah . ; That 's not completely negligible . ; Mm - hmm . ; Like a third of it is bad for adaptation or so .
Bmr024_725	s	Right ? ; It might also be potentially confusing . ; Yeah , but those are folded in , ; and it 's just you just mark the transcripts differently .
Bmr003_761	b	because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , and then you press the return key . ; But then , you know , it 's like , uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary . ; But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key ; Yeah .
Bro004_298	b	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's band - limited TIMIT . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_416	s	and then he 's here for a couple days before he goes to Salt Lake City . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; He 's I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that .
Bro021_906	%	Yeah , maybe ; One one plus N by X . ; But , n ; o
Bed006_387	s	Just sort of OK , what what what would you like to buy ; and then um OK there you wanna buy a whatever cuckoos clocks ; Yeah . ; OK and the there is a store there .
Bed013_1004	b	Lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it , ; Mm - hmm . OK . ; and lots of people go to attend a performance . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1177	s	I mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Um . ; I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this .
Bmr003_1173	s	or ei eight dollars . ; What do you know what the going rate is ? ; It 's it 's on the order of eight to ten . ; I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate .
Bmr009_793	bk	one 's a speaker form . ; Oh ! ; So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits . ; Oh , I see .
Bro027_1044	s	uh , ; they felt they wanted to set a limit . ; So they chose sixty . ; Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters
Bed006_621	s	Yeah . ; And the presentation agent will go " Hhh ! " Nuh ? ; OK . ; Like that the avatar .
Bro019_555	aa	But I guess it 's the s exactly the same thing ; because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this Wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , ; right ? ; Yeah ,
Bmr025_920	b	and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work . ; I mean that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened ; is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me ; Yeah .
Bmr007_634	%--	Yeah . ; You 've been working on that . ; right ? ; Right , I mean Adam was
Bmr021_382	ba	Watching the disk meter . ; That was that was the most excitement I had all weekend . ; Uh , uh boy , ; it uh came out just fine .
Bmr020_102	aa	so . ; Oops . ; Oh they they had some extension that they announced or something ? ; Well yeah .
Bmr024_1548	cc	and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , ; and I 'm not sure why . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I 'll keep working on it .
Bro022_357	%--	Um . ; Well , you know , there is this . ; Wait a minute . ; It it i maybe
Bro017_609	%--	In the ; No , ; in the proposal . ; in
Bro014_128	s	Mm - hmm . ; um , but it 's so much faster . ; Hmm . ; I it makes a big difference .
Bed014_627	b	Yeah . ; this is ; Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming ; Yeah .
Bed006_1467	s	so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it , ; Yeah . ; like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this , ; Yeah , we I will promise for the next time to have fleshed out N XML examples for a a run through and and see how this this then translates ,
Bmr014_148	s	I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired . ; So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ? ; Um , well , I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together ; so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless .
Bro018_281	s	The targets for the neural net , uh , they come from forced alignments ? ; But ; Uh , no . ; TIMIT canonical ma mappings .
Bmr022_750	%--	And just swap them in and out ? ; Yeah , we could certainly do that . ; So why not ? ; So uh , Morgan , just to
Bns001_107	s	but it has an important background . ; But mobile network this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer , ; especially because uh , until not so long uh , the the things were too heavy to have a computer , a wireless transceiver , on a more or less portable thing . ; So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing , in the market .
Buw001_573	bh	and ; I 've d When we when we have other meetings . ; When I have meetings on the European projects , we have someone taking notes . ; Oh , really ?
Bmr011_1005	bk	yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of ; Well we can talk about more details later . ; um , you know , ; yeah ,
Bmr012_352	%--	Cool . ; there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different ; Mmm . ; so you can see some like this Trent Lott which
Bro003_251	s	Because e e this is downsampled and and filtered , ; right ? ; So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone . ; And there are so many other differences between these different databases .
Bro004_833	cc	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it ; and and we 'll see .
Bro017_759	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Effectively , that 's that that 's I ; Exactly .
Bmr020_442	s	And then , the third thing was , we looked at , uh , what we call " interrupts " , ; although that 's that may be a misnomer , ; but basically we looked at cases where ; Uh , so we we used the punctuation from the original transcripts
Bed015_103	s	meaning category is what 's there . ; The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair ; and , um , ; sort of skipping fonts and whatever .
Bro005_942	b	Yeah . ; It 's sort of , yes it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr029_595	%--	it , uh might might not work out . ; But , uh , f figured I may as well ask for it . ; OK . ; I 'll ask
Bed008_1330	b	so that ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1484	b	ask queries . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro005_72	b	um ; But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . ; And ; Mmm , Yeah .
Bmr030_153	b	Hold down at hold down Alt , ; and then tap Tab several times ; and you 'll cycle through all the open applications . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1935	2	and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob uh p uh , things . ; And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now ; which is just well n n " NUMS " by itself ; " NUMS " ,
Bed009_549	s	I think you 're gonna need ; We talked about this several times that that the the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end . ; hmm ; In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff .
Bed006_1754	s	ye no but i ; Just think of it as as " wheel " in German . ; Do you see what I mean ? ; but if you if you if you work in th in that XML community it is a great acronym
Bmr009_262	b	I agree , yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; Um But since uh your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did in fact usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's eh you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition . ; OK .
Bro003_315	b	Mmm . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . ; Mmm .
Bro003_1746	%--	over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot . ; But if there if in fact there 's something else that he could be doing , that would help us when we 're we 're sort of uh strapped for time ; We have we we 've , you know , only , uh , another another month or two to you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to to get a lot done . ; If we can think of something some piece of this that 's going to be
Btr002_2003	s	No , no . While I while I 'm working here , ; No , no . OK . ; it 's like nine o ' ; and nobody 's here except for me ,
Bed003_1336	%--	Then again , everything else is free then once you 're ins in there . ; Food and drink and so forth . ; So . I mean . ; But i you know , i we can
Bmr016_1659	b	Yeah . ; Of " OK " , yes . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_101	s	um , ; I think one of the perplexing problems is , ; um , ; for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .
Bmr020_1549	%--	So the speech the amount of speech that is missed by the detector , for a good meeting , I th is around or under one percent , I would say . ; But there can be ; Yeah . ; For
Bmr026_513	b	Yeah . ; I s I sent this out a a day ago ; And put it where ? ; Right .
Bmr022_462	s	but maybe I 'm ; There must be . ; Because otherwise , you 're going a whole ; I think it should be more ,
Btr001_2562	b	You know , it 's really ; Those sorts of things , i it 's true , ; you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_289	s	and , uh ; so is i for it was a proposal for the ITR program , ; uh , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation . ; It 's the second year of their doing , uh , these grants .
Bed009_73	aa	But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone . ; OK So That sounds good . ; Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ? ; Sure .
Bmr028_167	bk	Like , even if we I think that even if we didn't display the waveform , it might be better to , rather , play the waveform than display it . ; I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played . ; Mm - hmm . ; I understand what you mean .
Bmr029_211	b	because we wanna get that started . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_235	s	and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot , ; OK ? ; And in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one , ; but uh for for what I want to say it 's it 's OK ,
Bsr001_2118	qh	It 's ; We we we were gonna use the same tool . ; Wow ! ; But what if you had like written the s the Tcl kluge or something , and then both done the same
Bro018_1141	t1	I I I th I think he ; What am I saying here ? ; Yeah , ; so that was the SRI system .
Bmr018_897	aa	Oh it 's it 's a ; so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with . ; yeah . ; Right .
Bmr002_1023	aa	OK . ; with like lists and lists and lists of uh various and assorted tools . ; OK . ; Yes .
Bmr030_201	s	Oh ! OK . ; So . ; Hmm . ; And it 's part of the talk itself ,
Bmr002_463	b	Yes . ; Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've I 've been involved with some of that . At at CogSci , ; um So , Susan E Susan Ervin - Tripp , who you know um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing ; Hmm .
Bmr005_967	s	Oh , that 's right , that had those have not been sent . ; H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ? ; We 're saying about twelve hours . ; About twelve by now . Twelve or thirteen .
Bmr011_995	s	Mm - hmm . ; and , um , here 's , uh , a a , uh , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , that was a contribution they could make . Uh in terms of time , money , you know ?
Bed002_1281	s	or a red line that goes to the Tango point ; or red line that goes to the door , ; which would be great . ; So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go .
Bns001_248	s	wha ; I believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things . ; Because from the mathematical description with QS - in - Advance , me , as an expert for quality of service and , uh , Michael as an expert for uh , MPLS and Wilbert an expert for for Multicast , and , uh , I discussed with Miguel . It 's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing , ; but it is still in the area of routing .
Bro028_511	s	So I 'm waiting to hear from him . ; But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about where the system is . ; Uh , they on their web site they , uh , did this little table of where their system performs relative to other systems that have done this this task . ; And , um , the Mississippi State system using a bigram grammar , uh , is at about eight point two percent .
Bmr028_841	s	Oh , yeah . That 's really hard . ; So ; Well , i it 's an interesting question , because I was thinking " well you can force align the transcriber transcripts , and then of course , you try to merge them in time . ; It 's not determined .
Bmr014_877	%--	If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . ; That I think that 's ; I 'm sort of psyching myself out here , ; I I 'm trying to uh
Bed006_324	qo	Yeah . ; Which I 'll hopefully sort of scrape together t ; But , thanks to Fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that . ; Questions ?
Bed015_854	b	and then , ; Ways that you can get it come from th ; hhh , the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that . ; right .
Bro027_1520	s	And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters , ; Yeah . ; and You know , I mean , uh , ; so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it .
Bed015_632	s	slightly different . ; Oh , I was asking Hans about this . ; They use it to really mean , um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required . ; So they have to be there or expressed in some way .
Bed002_340	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah ? ; and a source . ; So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions .
Bmr009_107	s	Something like that where it 's sort of data driven . ; Yeah , but I think also u I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the the signal is , when the two speaker ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Then , that 's a problem right there .
Bed003_976	s	What ? ; I didn't think it did learning . ; OK . ; Maybe it did a little bit of learning ,
Bed005_823	%--	And sort of we don't know how to handle them , too . ; Right ? ; I mean , it 's ; I d It
Btr002_2719	%--	But absolutely there , yeah . ; Good . OK . ; " Laugh " , change it . ; And , you know , there are other places where it 's in the way , you know .
Bmr009_513	b	I I I think this is a good idea . ; OK . ; Not consider the log energy . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_672	s	And hopefully it 's more like on the order of ; I 'm not sure that 's necessarily true . ; Yeah ? ; It is an empirical question , it seems like .
Bed015_1849	s	Right . ; Whatever . ; So ; y uh , no end of things th that that , you know , we don't deal with .
Bed009_324	s	There are only three possibilities and the uh ; what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want .
Bmr028_471	b	Cuz I bet she has this information . ; Yeah , that 's a good idea . ; I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1485	s	That makes sense . ; I didn't get that , ; OK . ; Yeah , and so , you know , I mean , th th I have there are some , um , Americans who who are using this " eh " too ,
Bro021_1073	%--	In this case , well , we can put here a Y . ; OK . ; So , yeah . ; It 's just by definition that the individual that the , uh
Bmr009_1302	bk	and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups ; and that it 's a huge waste of of space . ; Yep . ; OK .
Bmr002_1082	qw	And I could be wrong . ; Well , my my impression ; I I I really thought of these resources in the context of you you asking about time aligning the ; you know , What would you need to indicate
Btr002_400	no	but ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know where the rest of it came from .
Bmr026_58	s	I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; um It 's ; There 's only two channels .
Bmr011_641	s	which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . ; Right . ; So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , ; but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times .
Bro017_465	s	Hmm . ; Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data . ; Wow . ; And this uh that that sort of stuff .
Bmr024_534	b	Yeah . ; Actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for for the first part now . ; Synthesis system . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_121	bh	We we sorta spot - checked it . ; I listened to probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning . ; Yeah . ; Oh , really ?
Bed008_1192	qy	and everything else fades ; and you just see the links that are relevant to that . ; And I ; does anybody remember the GUI on this ?
Btr001_2639	ba	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I I agree , ; I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature .
Bmr027_518	s	And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , ; but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd at al at all . ; That 's how these mailing houses work . ; So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work
Bmr007_822	b	So you take a each frame , and you compute the energy ; and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero , so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bro025_252	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; And , yeah , it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not ; We cou we can do better , I think ,
Bmr011_959	aa	Well I think that that might change if you wanted really fine time markings . ; Yeah . ; But but really ; Well , OK .
Bed004_91	s	so I asked uh Litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , this is what she saw as part of as uh for instr introduction , ; this is what she had to read aloud .
Btr002_2290	b	Mm - hmm . ; That 's right . ; So . ; Hmm .
Bed016_741	s	Yeah . ; and you can be , you know , on the wagon . ; Right . So so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do . ; I mean you could do something much simpler
Bmr016_1568	s	Yeah , absolutely . ; Yeah . ; NSA , ; I see a few .
Bro019_788	no	Does it matter , ; or ? ; I d ; I don't know .
Bro017_914	co	So even though you 've expended the range , your mean doesn't match anymore . ; Mm - hmm . ; Do you see what I mean ? ; Let 's see .
Bed016_1075	s	A fixed expression , yeah . ; that 's a , uh ; Right . But . ; There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions
Bed003_256	s	So that means that I should switch to the other program . ; Um right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it , ; because we didn't know the probabilities of or ; Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up .
Buw001_1018	ba	It 's like this is not what we meant to research . ; Right , right . ; Oh . ; That could be very interesting .
Bro003_975	h	Test - B is a is a slightly mismatched . ; And test - C is a , um , mismatched channel . ; And do we do all our training on clean data ? ; Um ,
Bmr006_1710	b	Ugh ! ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_572	bk	superset , ; Yeah . Yeah . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr023_279	s	Uh . ; Uh . Our s our On our side ? ; or including IBM 's ? ; Including IBM 's .
Bro003_1782	s	Hmm . ; You can throw something in . ; You can do pretty well . ; But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that ,
Bed002_424	2	But the time of day matters a lot . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , if things are obviously closed , then , you ; People won't want to enter it .
Bmr026_140	s	So , uh ; But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . ; Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . ; The back - end stuff is working out fine .
Bro028_343	g	What if you did LPC - twenty ? ; LPC ? ; Twenty . ; Right ?
Bmr015_614	s	But , um , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have a a choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap , ; which means that you 're not tightly , uh , tuning the individual parts th of that overlap by different speakers . ; Mm - hmm . ; So someone may have only said two words in that entire big chunk of overlap .
Bmr019_1516	s	That 's the important thing . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; Hey , that 's the same percent relative ,
Bro018_138	b	And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um based on whether you feed it something different . ; And something different in some fundamental way . ; And so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before , was looking at something uh ab um something uh about the difference between the the uh um log FFT uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank . ; Yeah .
Bed013_365	s	or ; " here 's an idea " , right ? ; That 's what that paper was , ; " here 's here 's one possible thing you could do " ,
Bmr005_762	aa	What I mean is get it from the close - talking mikes . ; Uh , yeah . ; A or ge get a first pass from those , ; We t we t w we t we talked about that .
Bro019_732	%--	Yeah . ; Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched . ; It 's it 's ; Because it
Bmr016_1667	aa	Yeah that 's ; Although , what 's there 's one with a slash after it . ; That 's kind of disturbing . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1390	%--	it does this sometimes ; but other times it doesn't , ; is when you click on ; you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um , n the
Bro018_42	b	the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1623	bk	i ; Sorry . ; Go ahead . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1438	b	k ; Sure . ; and that way you 'll get more variety . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_33	s	Ah ! ; It 's just one sheet . ; Just one sheet . ; It 's just a Nothing else .
Bro005_243	s	Yeah . ; Um which is uh what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , ; Yeah . ; eighty - nine point seven .
Bro003_599	s	I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six . ; OK . ; Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system . ; You know , you 're really asking this net to learn .
Bro017_82	b	And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again uh what will be available th is will be a code . ; Mm - hmm . ; So the uh the people can go to code and say " well listen this is what you stole from me " ; Right .
Bns001_85	bk	but , the technical problem . ; But that 's under the s second topic , ; so first I would like that Miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background . ; OK .
Bmr003_1254	bk	Not being Morgan though , it 's ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I see .
Bro012_640	s	I think it 's the thirteenth of May . ; That 's great ! ; It 's great . ; So we should definitely get something in for that .
Bed004_681	aa	mm - hmm . ; So that 's ; but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through . ; Right .
Bro019_423	aa	And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use ; Hmm . ; So people won't even have to worry about , uh , doing speech - nonspeech then . ; Yeah
Bro008_167	s	Right . ; So , uh , in practice ; So you could 've had a repeat count in there or something . ; Well , n I mean , this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on .
Bmr022_1281	s	OK . ; Yep . ; but then it 's up to whoever is , sort of , responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these locks , ; Well , it 's it 's just like source code ,
Bns002_1153	aa	Yeah , but it 's really happened also in the riot case , you know . ; If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects , it 's , in principle , then the same . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1130	b	n ; Hello . ; Dan here . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2431	s	but . ; Yeah , ; that 's right , ; TIMIT .
Bro014_570	b	But i ; bu ; I I 'm confused . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2059	aa	That would be interesting . ; So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually ? ; Like you can't use gesture ? ; Yeah .
Bns002_1504	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah yeah . ; Yeah ? ; but these are then the official ones ,
Bro018_299	bh	Yeah . ; Well there 's gonna be it looks like there 's gonna be a noisy uh some large vocabulary noisy stuff too . ; Somebody 's preparing . ; Really ?
Bmr008_1658	b	But but I I think that this is a good first thing , to just sort of see . ; And and what this says is that th that without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro003_1527	%--	If i so , you 're on an NT machine , ; so you 're using some external machine ; Yeah , ; it ,
Bed015_1296	s	Mm - hmm . ; Or whate whatever . ; Yeah . ; So those constraints appear in constructions
Bmr018_1390	b	and that that makes it very hard . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_109	s	Yes , ; exactly . ; Yeah . ; And then , uh and then these also have I Ds .
Bmr029_295	h	For ; yeah , let 's say we just did the Meeting Recorder meetings for our test set . ; Uh . ; Um .
Bmr002_1067	aa	But you could get it through the U Penn ; slash slash capital CTA slash , l ; s l slash lots of other stuff , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1548	s	Oh , I thought it was you who was . ; No , well , but you were you were asking off the wall questions . ; Um ; But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK .
Bed015_1503	b	In fact , that 's kind of constraining how ; in some ways you know this before you get to the you fill in all the rest of it . ; I think . ; Mmm .
Bro026_58	bk	today . I mean , I can just log into ; Have you tried it yet ? ; No , I didn't . ; OK .
Bmr016_1098	s	OK . So I got a little print - out here . ; So three on this side , ; three on this side . ; And I stapled them .
Bmr019_130	b	So , uh ; They 're they 're intended to be omni - directional . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1359	%--	And then , the the dropping North , ; so it would be Western . ; It 's just one big shebang , where , of course , you have huge variation in dialects , ; But you do in the others , too . So .
Bmr016_1825	s	And then , yeah , in the case of " tickle " I guess we would just have a , you know , word " TCL " which ; Mm - hmm . ; You add it to the dictionary . ; which normally would be an acronym ,
Bed005_320	ba	be nice . ; No , no . ; Right Yeah . ; Fine .
Bed016_481	s	So , yeah , I think that 's that 's a good point , ; th th that the date , the , uh , ; a lot of the this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy ; but also definitely the people in Leipzig
Bsr001_2433	aa	that 's right , ; TIMIT . ; So we actually talked about that . ; Yeah ,
Bro012_57	b	Is it like twenty ? ; Something like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_993	b	Mm - hmm . ; But actually it had an interface . ; A lot of them were like , you know . ; Yep .
Buw001_2004	s	and also the political ; Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . ; Mm - hmm . ; Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap .
Bro014_1285	s	Yeah . ; So what is it ? ; And then you go back to the intuition that , ; well , you don't really get the excitation ,
Bmr016_1977	s	In that case it 's people saying things like " one one one dash so - and - so " ; or they 're saying uh " two I mean zero " whatever . ; OK . ; And in that case , it 's part of the numbers task ,
Buw001_21	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But I definitely haven't figured it out . ; Um , Meeting Recorder meeting .
Bmr011_1321	s	but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , " well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow ; Yeah . ; and try to convince people " . ; So I 'm gonna try . Go to their meeting tomorrow
Bmr027_950	s	Yeah , right . ; So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . ; Everything seemed fine . ; Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix .
Btr002_402	s	Yeah . ; I don't know where the rest of it came from . ; Uh , " groups of " , ; " gruesome " .
Bro019_1125	bk	Are similar or a little bit worse . ; With what what other new p new parameter ? ; You 're talking about your voicing ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_340	b	Absolutely . Yeah , absolutely . ; And also if you 're a non - native speaker transcribing it , you wouldn't necessarily kn uh , kn understand the conventions of English t intonation as , you know , intimately as a native speaker might . ; Yeah . That 's true . ; Right . Mm - hmm .
Bro027_1898	%--	um , ; Uh ; Mmm . ; I think
Bro003_1906	bk	but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered , ; and do we think there 's something wrong with that ? ; I think that there 's something wrong ; OK .
Bed006_710	s	When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ? ; Yeah . It 's the shadow . ; OK . ; Whereas I keep looking where your hand is ,
Bed003_1202	ft	Yeah . ; Could you put the the um , net up again ? ; Yes . ; Thanks .
Bmr008_1520	s	and pi and pitch for that matter . ; but ; Sure . ; But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time .
Bed008_1007	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Um actually is this the the right way to have it ; where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision ; I think so .
Bmr016_1801	qh	It 's just disturbing . ; Right . ; Right . ; We have this there is this thing I was gonna talk to you about at some point about , you know , what do we do with the dictionary as we 're up updating the dictionary ,
Bmr006_1817	s	I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . ; OK . ; Yeah , a lot of these things are . ; Discourse .
Bed003_1773	s	Mm - hmm . ; The the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . ; The data we get from Munich is very command line , ; simple linguistic stuff .
Bro024_1846	h	Because I think that you did some experiments using the two the two LDA filter , clean and noi and noise , ; It 's ; and it doesn't matter too much . ; Um ,
Bro023_244	%--	Mm - hmm . ; and ; Right . ; Oh , the other thing I guess which which ,
Bmr005_1080	s	Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , ; and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . ; And if you figure out well what 's the ; there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflections .
Bro018_317	s	Hmm . ; So . ; When are they planning When would they do that ? ; Mmm , I think late uh I think in the summer sometime .
Bed004_662	g	but that there 's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero . ; Mmm . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro011_298	s	Yes . ; Yeah that was actually my ; I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , ; Oh you
Bmr008_1618	b	Right ? ; Then you 're gonna end up with uh a a uh a mean uh standard devia deviation , and so forth . ; And then do your normalization based on that . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1235	%	but , mmm ; Yeah . ; Me either . ; t
Bmr021_192	s	Yeah , good mikes are expensive . ; And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure , ; So . ; the SM - ten - A 's ,
Bro024_824	b	It 's even it , uh , hurts even . ; So . ; We probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system - two kind of stuff with this , with the spectral subtraction for that reason . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_981	bk	If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ? ; did we ? ; I mean , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1320	b	Yeah . ; Across the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate . ; And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_318	s	Tomorrow ? ; March second , I said . ; Yeah . ; Tomorrow .
Bro021_231	bh	and you 've added the same thing to training and test . ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's , ; Hmm .
Btr002_1557	s	Yeah . ; Well , we 're coming kind of close to the end of our time here . ; Um , I did ask about dessert ; and they told me it was ice cream
Bmr019_799	b	Yeah . ; Not by every speaker ; but by some speaker there 's a lot of words . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1437	s	and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . ; But with nine speakers ; Eee ! Yeah . ; So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there .
Bed009_429	b	So this i this is where I think this ; Yes . ; people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_678	b	Yeah . ; yeah . ; With the recognizer ? ; Yeah .
Bed004_311	%--	and then um that was it , I think . ; So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net ; because I was I I took I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out ; so what I did was I took
Bro026_655	s	That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . ; Mmm . ; And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis . ; I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary .
Bed010_992	aa	so uh and , ; Right ; I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions . ; Sure .
Bmr018_1199	s	Well I won I noticed when you turned your head , it would it would tilt . ; Maybe it wasn't just tightened enough , or ; Maybe the yeah , the s thing that you have tightened @ @ , ; Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down .
Bro007_48	2	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then the KLT and then the two together again . ; No , the KLT .
Btr002_1357	s	Did anybody else here do that ? ; OK . ; I feel like I did a little checking or something on that . ; Actually , I think you might have done this also , as I think about it .
Bed005_580	b	And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default . ; That 's all they do it these days . ; Wherever you 'll find a route planner it n does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is at minimal distance to the geometric center . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_660	t1	and see which one is the the the best . ; Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what everything that has been done . ; So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on ; one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven
Bro021_1099	s	Oh . ; Yes . I understand now . ; And this is ; And that 's where it comes from .
Bmr014_294	b	So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could . ; Yeah , he might he might be asking ; You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also . ; Right .
Buw001_1469	bk	OK . ; And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr006_870	b	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling " event " is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_802	%--	Hmm . ; I bet it isn't , unless it 's really close to right . ; Yeah . ; I have just because it 's such an un
Bns001_1216	s	This application has certain kind of requirements . ; These requirements are , maybe , Multicast and and and quality of service and mobility ; access and then mobility management ; and That is it .
Bmr024_1396	qw	Actually , there is the difference in that . ; So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes . ; And for the in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one . ; And what 's the top frequency of each ?
Bed016_1151	ba	Also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example , ; We ; so , even temporal references are ; just in the spatial domain are rare .
Bmr007_917	b	Yeah , the you know , the reason that he , uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better , it was it was it was the place he was starting . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1199	b	Well , this is this function is the the term after develop this , the term that we we take . ; Give PX and , uh , P the noise . ; X K C noise . ; Mmm .
Bmr028_24	s	So like Morgan asked about the demo status . ; We can go ahead and talk about that a little bit . ; And then do then alternate in more depth . ; By the way , I 'll I I won't be here next Thursday .
Bro004_659	s	Yeah . ; So these are the results of OGI with on - line normalization ; and straight features to HTK . ; And the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to HTK .
Bro010_424	s	be before everything . ; OK , ; so just do that on the mel f ; We we was thinking to do before after VAD
Bmr022_13	aa	and so I can't miss that . ; You 're a May birthday , ; right ? ; I 'm a May birthday , yeah ,
Bmr005_1459	%--	Yeah . ; we don't have to ask them to ; even and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual ; n Well
Bmr001_163	s	Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on . ; Yeah . ; So . ; But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible .
Bro028_728	aa	Well , we can probably use the real thing , ; can't we ? ; And then jus just , uh , use it on a reduced test set or something . ; Yeah . Oh , yeah .
Bro003_1849	t3	which ; Yeah , ; the tr the transcription , though , for Albayzin is n the transcription are of SAMPA the same , uh , how you say , symbol that SAMPA appear . ; SAMPA ?
Btr001_871	b	it 's it 's funny how , um , ; i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes ; and I 've run across that also . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_52	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; He 's he 's done a couple stays here . ; Hmm .
Bmr005_1248	s	you know , we 'll collect what we collect here ; hopefully they will collect more at UW also ; and um and maybe we have this other source . ; But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours .
Bro023_1738	s	Um ; Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases , ; and , um , ; also to , um , try different kind of features , uh , as input to the VAD network .
Bmr016_2264	s	Yeah , I mean ; So ; yeah . ; uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated
Bro024_496	s	Well , the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five . ; So it 's just an ad - hoc ; I mean , some intermediate result , because it 's not optimized for anything . ; So the results The trend the only trend I could see from those results was like the the p the current noise estimation or the , uh , noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing .
Bro012_861	2	So would the major effect is that you 're gonna get is by normalizing the means , ; but it may help ; That 's the first order but thing , ; First - order effects .
Bro014_565	aa	So i ; Um , ; S ; sure .
Bmr013_689	b	Right . ; Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed015_925	%--	Yeah . ; Right . ; All of these ; and will we have u
Bro018_590	h	Mm - hmm . ; Um . Hmm . ; Let 's see . ; Uh .
Bed006_1800	t3	No just just transcript . ; Yeah , well just transcript is just not available ; because nobody has transcribed it yet . ; Sorry .
Bmr008_438	co	So . ; Hmm . ; OK . ; As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form .
Bed013_810	qw	and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side . ; Remember I came in and I started asking you about how we were sor going to sort out the uh , decision nodes ? ; Yes ! ; What 'd you say ?
Bro016_1065	s	Yeah . I think the ; just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event . ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's , um in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between , um , acoustic features and acoustic events .
Bmr014_894	s	the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . ; But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence . ; And and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , ; and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff .
Bmr029_572	b	and and , um , ; Mm - hmm . ; it 'd be kinda nice to have some results at least a day or two before that , so that I could figure out what I wanted to say about it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_956	s	Yeah . Because you can get a number uh , for that with the other as well . ; Uh . Right . ; Right ? ; You can turn those things off .
Bmr009_81	b	And so you take that . ; And then he 's he 's uh measuring at the frame level ; still at the frame level , of what ; Right .
Bed015_1496	%--	Yeah , yeah . ; And down there in the speaker - hearer part ? ; S so , that 's I think that 's just ; n
Bro003_636	b	so even even though the meeting recorder doesn't doesn't , uh ; and since you 're not running a video camera we won't get this , ; but if you use a board it 'll help us anyway . ; OK .
Bro024_766	s	Yeah . ; And ; it was surprising ; At the beginning it was not surprising to me that you get really the best results on doing it this way ,
Btr002_3353	s	And offhand , I don't know if that 's a vocal noise or non - vocal noise . ; Mmm . ; And so then I listen to it and I figure it out . ; But that 's the only place you would use a " vocal " " non - vocal " tag ,
Bmr007_905	s	Right . ; Um another another research thing , different groups , eh working , eh on Broadcast News prefer to , eh to consider hypothesis eh between each phoneme . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , when a phone changes .
Bed014_504	s	OK , so that 's a that 's a separate issue . ; Slightly different . ; OK . ; So I a I I th I agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every uh , pragmatic reading ,
Bmr013_112	s	well , " real " , ; Um , the uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant . ; Uh but in a car , ; instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise .
Bro004_1446	t1	for a lot of the things we 're doing , ; whereas , w exactly which HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend uh ; So with that , maybe we should uh go to our digit recitation task . ; And , it 's about eleven fifty .
Bro024_1134	b	OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Can we look at this ? ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1937	%	Well then you have to do the web site . ; But ; You know , it 's like , it 's that simple . ; " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . "
Bro003_949	s	so , uh , ; Yeah ; something like seven things in each , uh each column . ; So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , different systems that are going to be developed .
Bmr010_1515	b	th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things ; Hmm . ; and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator . ; Yeah .
Btr001_476	aa	I can imagine that , ; I could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses , I was like , " I can see how you how you couldn't understand that " , ; Hmm . ; yeah .
Bdb001_105	b	You know , thirty - eight , ; whatever you want . ; So you 're essentially defining a lattice . ; OK .
Bro024_36	%--	And , um , ; I ran some tests last night . ; But , um , ; c
Bmr007_721	s	I 'll do that on the next set of forms . ; So you 'd number them somehow . ; Yeah . ; Is possible to get information from the rhythmic f from the ge , eh uh , files .
Bro013_395	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So that 's good . ; Uh . So there is this thing . ; There is
Bmr003_1490	aa	It was ; A lot of overlapping , yeah . ; Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end . ; Yeah .
Bro016_1054	h	So , he In this paper , um , it 's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events . ; So , things like frication or , uh , nasality . ; Whose paper is it ? ; Um ,
Bed002_4	s	OK , we 're on . ; So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . ; Check one . ; Check one .
Bmr025_90	%--	OK . ; DARPA demos , ; we had the submeeting the other day . ; Right , which uh
Bmr014_1176	s	some something might sometime , and they uh ; if if it 's something that they said , they might ; i i ; I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said ,
Bed004_610	qh	Yeah , so the pro The immediate problem is is back t t to what you were what you are doing with the belief - net . ; Yeah . ; You know , uh what are we going to use to make this decision ; Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?
Bro014_789	b	Then we tried , um , to do something like proposal - two ; but having , um , e using also MSG features . ; So there is this KLT part , which use just the standard features , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_75	ba	and they have some name . ; So so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct ; Yeah , right . ; OK , that 's fine .
Bmr018_1288	s	um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ? ; Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there ; Yep . ; and and , uh , um , so they they have their their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes ,
Bro014_477	s	uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; and , uh , I 'd almost argue for weighting that highest .
Bmr013_288	b	Uh . ; Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . ; And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling ; Right .
Bmr009_1491	s	The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down . ; M ; Fantastic ! ; Just uses a lot of memory .
Bmr030_491	%--	They 're just doing ; Right , right . ; OK . ; So what we do is , uh , when I go to um , select meetings for IBM , I go into the um
Bmr005_1058	s	and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something It may you Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly ; and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that 's the party line .
Bmr008_1184	bd	and the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field . ; Well , the there 's @ @ I mean . ; I g you You 're the expert on the D T ; Well , the D T Ds mean we can do whatever however we want it .
Bed005_1104	b	D and you got one , Robert . ; I don't know who else has seen it . ; There 's I mean ; yeah .
Bed002_1249	s	Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday ; is show the state and show the system and show that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate .
Bro012_290	s	Mm - hmm . ; Well . Yes . ; So . ; And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .
Bed005_830	s	Ooo ! ; Yeah . ; Nancy , it looked like you were s ; Oh . it 's just that that the goals are g very different to cases
Bro018_309	aa	Hmm ! ; For what ; For Aurora ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_1139	qrr	No , you get it with Wiener filtering also . ; Yeah . ; Does the smoothing in the time domain help with that ? ; Or some other smoothing ?
Bmr019_1042	s	You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words . ; Oh , yeah . ; And " uh - huh " is not as frequent ; as it sort of would be in Switchboard ,
Bed011_778	b	Yeah . ; y so And I like the idea that , you know , sort of ; Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_2518	%	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; I I we can get digits . ; I
Bmr018_669	s	They just plain got it all right . ; Yeah . ; And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something . ; But if you p if you actually histogrammed it , and it was a nice uh , you know , it it was zero was the most of them ,
Bed011_12	b	Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every uh , ; it seems to have about at two minute ; Yeah , I 've I uh it 's not that I didn't try . ; OK .
Bmr029_198	b	So , ; the training . ; But the segmentations matter for the filtering . ; Yeah .
Bro027_404	bk	Oh , OK . ; He ; And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr009_1498	s	I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls .
Buw001_1072	b	or people aren't gonna want to do this . ; But but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful . ; And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample ; Hmm .
Bns002_23	aa	it 's only for fixing it . ; It 's not a earphone . ; Ah , it 's not a hear ; No .
Bed006_914	aa	It 's OK . ; Uh a link between the action schema , a field in the s in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use ; so we could ; Yeah .
Bmr007_87	s	OK . ; Same idea ? ; But , same idea . ; So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before ,
Bmr007_836	s	OK and then the other thing I did , was I took Javier 's speaker - change detector acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes , ; and unfortunately that 's not working real well , and it looks like it 's ; the problem is he does it in two passes , ; the first pass is to find candidate places to do a break .
Bdb001_181	s	I mean , you 'd y ; Um , ; cuz th it does get very bush with ; I I am imagining you 'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want .
Bed013_931	bk	Oh , discourse . ; Yeah . ; Discourse is all things linguistic , yeah . ; So that 's not like context , OK .
Bro005_251	%--	Same result pretty much ? ; Well , we have these results . ; I don't know . ; It 's not
Bro024_1822	s	still I don't have the result for TI - digits . ; The program is training . ; Maybe for this weekend I will have result TI - digits ; and I can complete that s like this .
Bed006_1254	aa	So we would put " write a letter " in the categories uh that in which it had it w had uh schemas u ; There could be a communication event action or something like that ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly .
Bns002_465	%	and usually you know that reception is successful if every bit has passed the CRC check . ; OK ? ; You have checked that the that this frame has received uh without errors . ; Naja to to
Bns003_640	%--	uh an open source router . ; This is that from from Mark , right ? ; No , ; in
Btr001_1756	s	cuz everyone 's laughing . ; Someone has just said something funny ; Uh - huh . ; and everyone 's like , " Ah - ha - ha - ha - ha " .
Bro021_753	s	So . ; Oh . How about you , Carmen ? ; Mmm . I 'm working with VTS . ; Um , I do several experiment with the Spanish database first ,
Bro011_691	s	Right . ; um so ; Right . ; if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .
Bns001_497	s	The the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And the building blocks ,
Bmr026_507	s	Right . ; Yep . ; but But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . ; I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .
Bmr009_593	b	Yeah . ; That 'd be great . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr009_421	s	Um . ; Consider different class of overlap ? ; Yeah , that we would be working on anyway . ; If there 's time .
Bro019_1422	b	Yeah . ; Um , ; were were you gonna say something ? ; Mmm .
Bmr007_563	s	Right . ; Right . ; So so here 's a here 's a first interesting labeling task . ; say , because there 's a lot of that .
Bmr011_1460	s	Oh . ; Right . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Right . That was a big fear .
Bed015_717	s	the I w I would just ; s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat . ; I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . ; I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it .
Bmr020_1526	b	And then , uh in a bad meeting , or p some meetings where he said oh he 's had some problems , what does that mean ? ; Uh - huh . ; So I mean does one of the does it mean one percent and ten percent ? ; OK .
Bmr006_1733	bk	Yeah . ; And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it . ; But it doesn't say " Jose " , it says " speaker - five " . ; OK .
Bmr008_681	b	" What language was spok " , ; yeah , so it 's not where did you grow up , but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of , what would it be , five and twelve or something like that ? ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_331	b	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And ; is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation ; Right .
Bmr003_2106	s	Oh . ; Yeah . ; OK , not just sleeve them all ? ; I 'm I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down .
Bmr019_1627	%--	the NSA one , ; which we hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it , ; Mm - hmm . ; because the non - native speaker
Bmr013_873	cc	It 's like ; y it 's and so , um , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that ; but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , ; and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase
Bro024_1720	aa	Yeah , ; or some silence probability from the VAD if you have ; Um , ; yeah ,
Bed012_184	%--	But . Again , in this Given this input , we , also in some situations , may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now ; the nicest way , ; use a cab , ; or so s
Bmr008_735	qw	because that 's very easy for a person to fill out . ; But I think we still have this problem of is it gonna be a self - evaluation ? ; or are we gonna ask them " what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher " w ; What 's the best way of phrasing the question ?
Bmr027_159	s	The German ones ? ; Uh , well . ; Yeah . Those uh ; NSA .
Bro005_1193	qo	right ? ; That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . ; So they did At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . ; So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ?
Bmr014_527	aa	Oh good . ; it was spelled GABBL ; Sort of how it sounds . ; Yes .
Bmr022_1460	%	Right , but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora . ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Definitely .
Bro005_213	s	Yeah . ; So , um So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . ; Now w would do we have a number , I suppose for the matched ; I I don't mean matched ,
Bro024_1649	s	Because I mean , it should have a similar effect if you ; Yeah . ; I mean , you you have now several stages of smoothing , so to say . ; You start up .
Bro017_973	s	right ? ; Variance . ; So , when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score . ; I mean it was just , you know , incredibly high score , and so that was throwing everything off .
Bns002_128	g	So , uh ; higher area could be covered , could be explored ; and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing , to extend the distance , the maximum distance , than uh a single radio transmission will would allow . ; OK ?
Bmr013_380	s	But . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four , ; The word . ; Yeah . ; this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever ,
Bmr007_276	s	Actually , um um actually not . ; Uh , so le let 's think about the case where A starts speaking and then B overlaps with A , and then the minute boundary happens . ; And let 's say that after that minute boundary , um B is still speaking , and A overlaps with B , ; that would be a new overlap .
Bro018_587	b	and otherwise it 's the other class . ; So why save the examples ? ; Why not just save what the boundary itself is ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1138	aa	Oh , I see . ; Oh , darn . ; It 's a little bit at odd to ; Of course , of course , of course .
Bro015_219	bk	They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen . ; Yeah , because it was around between sixteen and twenty ; or ; OK .
Bmr010_1125	s	And and I checked them over . ; I ; I I I haven't checked them all , ; but just spot - checking .
Bed010_801	s	But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . ; And i this is , um ; So . In addition to the e ; This is more proximal - distal .
Btr002_2253	b	Then you hear it . ; Yeah . ; So , th it 's kind of like that . ; Right .
Bmr010_340	%--	That 's great . ; Yeah . ; And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian 's thing ? ; I sent it to ,
Bmr005_1338	bd	we had This came up when she she was here . ; That 's important . ; Yeah , ; So it 's a great idea ,
Bmr022_265	b	pretty simple . ; That 's a good idea . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr011_794	%--	We spoke for an hour and a half ; Hmm . ; and , um , had an awful lot of things in common . ; He , um , um , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been ,
Bmr011_1797	aa	To to mark ; Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . ; The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c uh , time things . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_660	bk	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK . ; OK .
Btr001_331	s	because he started like he would say certain words over and over , ; Yeah . ; and ; And you got to know his pronunciation of them .
Bmr011_404	b	that 's true . ; yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_957	b	And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . ; Exactly . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bed011_234	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh Lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you better data than l you know , a few pronunciations of lots more things . ; OK . ; That 's one .
Bed013_1290	bk	Well , if you if you can , oh definitely do , ; OK . Where possible . ; where possible . Right ? ; OK .
Btr002_3176	b	Mm - hmm . ; So I think for both of the reasons it 's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word - like way . ; So even if it 's " er " , or ; Right .
Bro005_1264	s	Yeah , I think so . ; I think they were also mainly , ; well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , ; but mainly trying to tune their their system as it is now
Bro016_236	s	I 'll bet you there 's still a lot of insertions . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And it may be less of a critical thing .
Bro012_44	s	But . ; Yeah . ; So when we 're doing all these things using our software there is ; um if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP um then uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which um allows you to do high - pass filtering
Bmr026_665	s	Me too . ; Well , OK , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ? ; Jane may not be . ; Jane , I think .
Bro014_1392	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Oh .
Bro017_1014	s	Huh ! ; Didn't you say you got these uh HTK 's set up on the new Linux boxes ? ; That 's right . ; In fact , and and they 're just t right now they 're installing uh increasing the memory on that uh the Linux box .
Bro026_70	b	Yeah , it works . ; Oh , good ! ; Great ! ; Oh .
Bro010_310	b	So it it would probably feel different ; Right . ; but I don't think it would feel slow . ; Right .
Bmr031_1650	s	Uh , and I already I already said what I was doing , ; which is mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he he he actually does the real work on this , uh , reverberation thing . ; But I think it 's it 's it 's a real , uh it 's a real learning experience for both of us . ; And and , uh , I think it 's it 's a problem ar problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much , as we know .
Bmr002_1123	s	so there may be ; it may be worthwhile to at least try a little bit to combine the channels . ; Right . ; I Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs ,
Bmr026_959	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; So that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a better system ; Yeah .
Bed015_2178	qw	Oh , you have something . ; In the process thereof , or whatever . ; OK . ; So , what 's what when are we gonna meet again ?
Bed016_611	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; The b the the double arrow . ; Yep .
Bmr009_89	s	Yeah , maybe it 's not log distributed . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; and it 's just , you know , it it diminishes the effect of having two of them .
Bro017_757	b	Cuz ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_394	b	And they won't know . ; S I think it 's it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr031_1034	aa	And it 's not quite clear always what what it is you mean . ; Which " uh - huh " ? ; Which one it is ? ; Yeah .
Bed006_1517	%	Uh that 's true . ; Sure . ; Although um roles ; Yeah .
Bed009_615	s	Wh - where 's ? ; Yeah , he 's he started um I think January . ; Yeah . ; And he 's gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner .
Bed012_159	s	or how likely it is that he wants to get information . ; But , maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate . ; So , does he wanna know where it is ? or does he wanna go there ? ; He wants to know where it is .
Bed013_1398	s	Yeah . ; That 's good . ; Nice overture , ; but , you know , just not really
Bmr030_490	b	Th - they 're just doing their own thing , like , while they 're waiting . ; They 're just doing ; Right , right . ; OK .
Bmr008_324	s	Wait , why is that optional ? ; Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down . ; Yeah . ; So I don't want to make them feel like they have to .
Bmr019_178	s	It might be interesting to do that . ; Cuz my my cuz my sense , ; um ; But but , I have I mean , people people at SRI are actually working on digits .
Bro019_648	%--	but this is not significant . ; But , the problem is that it 's not significant , ; but if you put this in the , mmm , uh , spreadsheet , it 's still worse . ; Even with very minor
Bsr001_491	b	but . ; I find this one is no problem at all . ; The only thing is a little bit of audio a a little bit of audio degradation in one ear , ; Yeah .
Bed015_167	b	So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I ; Yeah , yeah . ; It 's used shouldn't matter , right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_25	s	I s I spoke with several of you about this , ; but just to brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we got back the IBM transcript , and the accuracy looks OK .
Bro017_1051	s	It was in old days when there were uh of PDP - eights and that sort of thing . ; Oh , my gosh ! ; So he had to make it look like ; Because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent I i i or on on this particular project .
Bmr020_787	cc	Yeah , it ; Just put in another directory . ; Well , make ano make another directory . ; I 'll make another directory .
Bmr014_920	s	so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it . ; Hmm . ; You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , ; and useful for someone else if they need it .
Btr002_48	s	and maybe , uh , go over some some ideas about , um , ; well , i the return to the conventions , ; but I also wanted to , uh , share with you a couple of the things that I 've picked up in terms of checking . ; And these are uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts .
Bmr018_628	s	Oh , OK . ; I see . ; And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , uh , six out of the eight channels were all , like had a hundred percent error . ; Which probably means like there was a th the recording interface crashed ,
Bro022_1129	s	because the signal have different level of energy . ; Hmm ? ; And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . ; But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise .
Bmr011_864	b	I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , uh , transcription . And he and he did . ; And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . ; And , um , that 's , uh You know , I need to get back to him and and , uh , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , ; Hmm .
Bed015_1167	s	some of them seem more inherently static , OK , ; like a container or sort of support - ish . ; And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic ; like " source , path , goal " is often thought of that way
Bmr020_1212	bk	Oh , OK , ; Oh yeah ! ; I didn't I didn't understand that . ; OK .
Bmr018_746	s	The issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels . ; I didn't think so either . ; And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to ; so so there are some things available ,
Bed013_78	s	You mean that sort of thing ? ; Absolutely . ; OK . ; And once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself .
Bmr025_609	aa	He w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup . ; I mean , his point was well taken . ; This data cannot be recovered . ; Yeah .
Btr001_990	s	and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ? ; I mean , maybe " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK " ; and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either , ; so it 's it 's definitely there 's a , uh , choice of how far you go with that , and whether " kay " is is enough of a variant
Bmr009_709	aa	But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks , ; Mm - hmm . ; and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this student and I would be looking at the time marks ; Yep , I agree .
Bmr030_284	aa	I mean , so , there 's obviously a trade - off between the number of knots y you pick , and the best fit . ; I mean , so , if you 're doing a piece - wise linear , you have to figure out how many pieces you want . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Sure .
Bmr003_1749	bk	and if it 's picked up by a different speaker , it 's picked up by a different speaker . ; The time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that and they sort of swap . ; I guess if you have more than one thread going , then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1006	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I do have a convention . If it 's an a noncanonical p " ; That one , I think we you know , with Eric 's work , I sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant .
Bmr010_476	s	uh ; and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation . ; Oh , yeah . He was talking he was talking I mean , uh , we he had ; Cross - correlation .
Bed013_475	bk	So , interesting , both , like , child language people . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; OK .
Bro016_772	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; We we have estimation of post posteriors with PLP and with MSG as input ,
Bmr026_1023	b	So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh ; Yeah . ; just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1619	s	I actually have to leave . ; OK . ; So . Um . I mean I had to leave at three thirty , ; so I can Well , I can wait for the digits but I can't stay for the discussion
Bro027_745	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And we still don't have the neural net in . ; So so it 's
Bmr028_1269	%--	Right . Right . ; Oh , I see . ; If you wanna use the old ; You can actually never , though , really infer what you would get with a different
Bmr012_1043	s	OK . ; Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony ; Oh . ; believe it or not
Bro027_1692	b	Um ; Wh - uh , the the VAD what ? ; We have the VAD information also available at the back - end . ; Uh - huh .
Bed015_1714	aa	and then builds up ; Mm - hmm . ; d doesn't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , that whenever I say something I could preface that with " I think . " ; Yeah .
Bns002_718	s	but not not uh , by me . ; But uh , there is , uh one , at least one person who is who is doing what they call " topology control " , ; Mm - hmm . ; and this is , uh related to to uh the control of the transmission power to get uh certain properties uh from your network ,
Bro007_305	s	it is because we we we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the KLT ; and yeah . ; and we not s we are not sure if we pick we have the silence . ; So we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions .
Bns003_846	s	we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about Quality of Serving routing . for MPLS in an MPLS domain . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you have um distributed routing at the edges , ; and one aspect is that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the exact information of your links , dates , and so on .
Bro007_379	s	do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ? ; it d ; I think we fixed on Tuesday , yeah . ; I Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up .
Bmr023_1061	b	But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now ; and I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features ; uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the SRI system , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1090	no	The PC one is the Amaretto one , ; right ? ; I don't know . ; I don I 'm not sure .
Bmr012_464	aa	So . ; Oh yeah . ; right ? ; Right .
Bmr023_1112	s	Right . ; Well , you might e e ; So that 's that 's another ; So , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,
Bed005_596	%--	Oh . ; Does this does this make sense to you guys ? ; It I mean you 're you 're doing the the interaction ; but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh , something where you , um
Bro018_1179	h	Is that right ? ; Do you know which one it is ? ; It 's trained on a lot of different things . ; Um .
Bmr019_1713	s	Tomorrow ; Because , eh , I leave , eh , the next Sunday . ; The last meeting meeting ? ; It 's off .
Bmr014_1091	s	because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting ; and we 're already short on disk space . ; Yeah . ; So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and
Bro012_1115	s	Mm - hmm . ; and ; uh ; working towards June .
Bmr007_792	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , I 've been playing with , um uh , using the close - talking mike to do to try to figure out who 's speaking . ; Yeah . ; So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about about two weeks ago ,
Bed016_781	s	or , maybe you could say something like " The film is out " ; Yeah , is film the trajector ? ; so like the the film went away from where it should be , ; namely with you , or something ,
Bmr026_848	s	And ; Not all of ; No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . ; The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .
Bmr016_2136	ba	like " read " ; yeah , basically . ; Mm - hmm . ; But other than that I it sounds great .
Bmr018_1191	s	See ya . ; See ya . ; Um , oh , before you l go ; I don't think we 'll go much longer .
Btr002_393	no	Yeah . ; You know what I mean ? ; Like , where would you get the word " gruesome " ? ; I don't know .
Bmr015_652	s	And I think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation ; because maybe , um , we can close in on that wi without having to actually go to the time that it would take to listen to every single channel from start to finish through every single meeting . ; Yeah , but those backchannels will always be a problem I think . ; Uh especially if they 're really short
Bmr010_396	s	Hmm . ; That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient . ; Yeah , exactly . ; And just keep those things separate .
Bro016_296	b	So ; Uh ; I just sorta think we need to explore the space . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_804	s	um , yeah , there 's a way to tell . ; It might not be a single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people , ; Right . ; and , um , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , you know , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that .
Bmr021_363	s	And and so ; Mm - hmm . ; I uh had this flash of inspiration of just ; uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them ,
Bro010_129	b	which will perhaps add some more delay . ; Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very um perf well , not very correct , ; like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . ; Yeah .
Bed015_420	b	so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back . ; But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um , we ought to ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1132	s	is this the the place where we would do that , or is there another place . ; I 've been thi I it seems to be that there is We could attach more structure if we wanted to . ; Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships . ; I Maybe I was missing something maybe ,
Bro025_145	b	Yeah , we can do it later . ; But , still so , there will be a piece of software with , uh , will give this system , the fifty - three point sixty - six , by default ; and ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1434	b	I see . ; I don't what their scripts are set up to do for the Aurora stuff , ; but ; Yeah .
Bed013_410	%	just just put it on . ; I 'm ; Did Ben harass you ? ; OK .
Bed005_1153	s	It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there . ; But , anyway , s skipping skipping the question of exactly which functions ; now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table . ; I mean , in some it seems very plausible in some sense , where we will be likely to not be observe some of the stuff .
Bmr024_1518	b	but I uh , I don't wanna go into , ; Mm - hmm . ; but but I I I th I think it could be the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way , uh , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth , ; Yeah .
Bmr022_224	b	Yeah ? ; Hmm . ; And you know , since there are no more than , you know , ten speakers or so per meeting , there 's plenty of tone space . ; Oh .
Bmr016_757	ba	OK . ; so you don't have to do it by hand . ; Alright . ; Great .
Bmr007_935	aa	Mm - hmm . ; An - and then , eh eh without considering the you you you , um you can consider the energy like a another parameter in the in the feature vector , ; Right . ; Absolutely .
Btr001_2388	b	So you meant just sort of like a just a normal " uh " ? ; It 's just a normal " uh " . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_317	s	So , uh ; Yeah . ; So let 's talk about the digits , since they 're not here yet . ; Uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on ,
Bns001_910	s	You can have this f to figure out all the things ; and the the um ; and the the um ; um , now , how to say , the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario .
Bmr009_529	%--	Oh , that 's not what I meant . ; No , no . ; I I I I ; Well , we certainly should see this but I I I I think that the harm
Bmr016_598	bk	And it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech . ; So , your your ASR results were run on the channels synchronized , ; Yes , cuz that 's all that w had been transcribed at the time , ; OK .
Bro003_1771	s	that 's something that needs to be done ; in any event . ; Yeah . ; So what we were just saying is that that , um I was arguing for , if possible , coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research
Bed005_758	aa	or ; Or the re the restaurant where they wear lederhosen ? ; Or the ; Right .
Bro027_562	aa	Delta at input to net ? ; And there i ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro018_496	s	Cuz uh the Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years , ; and ; uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training . ; So , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current TIMIT markings into the markings you want .
Bmr029_323	t1	I mean , if we had about six A six hour test set 's not bad . ; Right ? ; Right . ; S six hour test set .
Bmr003_2226	bk	Well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered . ; So ; th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things . ; Right .
Bmr003_765	%	so it 's slightly delayed , ; so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here . ; So that takes time . ; a
Bed015_864	bk	Yeah . ; But , uh , if you don't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways , ; Right . ; That 's fine , yeah .
Bro004_1037	b	um . But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net ; and maybe sometimes you don't run the other , ; maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_279	b	Yeah sure sure . ; Yeah sure . ; Yeah ; Yeah .
Bed015_1155	b	Then " predications " makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . ; Open to various things . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed005_73	qy	and I think we 're just gonna use it as it is , ; and Um ; N . ; You happy with that ?
Btr001_247	b	because of singing . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Huh .
Bed008_469	s	whereas this is a ; Mm - hmm . ; What would a hotel fall under ? ; I would call that a service ,
Bns001_1263	s	It 's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet , ; because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible . ; So how to combine these pos uh potential um extensions in the um access networks , and ; without losing the end to end scope in the internet .
Bed006_1128	b	M Th ; uh I mean but very difficult . ; The other thing that I just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som ; Yeah .
Bed009_691	s	But of course the the more complex ; Yeah , there is another philosophical issue that I think you know you can evade ; yep . ; but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh a service is gonna come and describe itself to you .
Bns001_726	%--	I mean to be done here , ; And because ; For inf ; not not at the
Buw001_97	s	Like ; Uh , especially for querying . ; Especially for querying . ; So , getting people to do queries afterwards ,
Bmr018_1477	ba	One of those w ; Yeah . ; that was interesting . ; Yeah , that was an interesting discussion ,
Bed010_803	s	So . In addition to the e ; This is more proximal - distal . ; Yeah uh exactly . ; So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded .
Bmr027_508	s	and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people ; and hand it to , uh ; you know , just give it to me ; and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever ,
Bmr027_1022	s	" OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting . ; The last time , uh " And the transcriber thought " little too much " ; But , uh , ; really , um , it was " we learned too much " ,
Bns001_457	aa	That 's still in mind . ; But for with the cases there There , it is possible . ; So that should be made possible then ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_221	s	but we saw , uh , ; when we used it , uh , f for our close - talking microphone , which ; yeah , for our for our recognizer in Munich ; we saw that w it 's it 's not it 's not so necessary .
Bmr020_672	s	Anyway . ; So the paper 's on - line ; and ; y I I think I uh I CC ' ed a message to Meeting Recorder with the URL
Btr001_1260	s	Something like that , right ? ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Which makes no sense to me .
Bro023_1553	b	Mmm . ; So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal , ; so if the the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track better track the noise , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_957	g	Uh . Right . ; Right ? ; You can turn those things off . ; Right ?
Bro017_1019	aa	Hey ! ; And Chuck is sort of really fishing for how to keep his computer busy , ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro022_551	s	but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero ; components , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . This is another difference .
Bed009_517	s	Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast , ; take a taxi . ; OK . ; And the language end doesn't know that .
Bmr024_997	b	Well , regardless ; Well , first of all there was , um , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , ; because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_1294	%--	Yeah . ; because the other ; Yeah . ; So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to
Bro003_1082	s	I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out , ; um ; It 's not really two to the seventh . ; But it 's but but i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings
Buw001_1816	b	e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , ; which is always good for presentations . ; So ; Yeah .
Bmr006_753	t3	Sorry , sorry . ; Go ahead . ; And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . ; I should 've got the digital camera .
Bmr021_354	ba	Right . ; and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to decode it on the fly . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that that just saved my butt
Bmr022_461	%--	I was thinking there was on the order of fifteen hundred segments , ; but maybe I 'm ; There must be . ; Because otherwise , you 're going a whole
Bmr018_360	%--	But ; I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do . ; So , they 're they 're looking at a mixed signal , ; or they 're looking
Bmr031_222	s	Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation w on the test set . ; No , supervised adaptation . ; Supervised . ; So , we 're doing s unsupervised speaker adaptation .
Bed006_1051	s	Well , for me it seems that uh ; I mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once , ; r Yes . ; but in this case it 's really like there 's a purpo means that you know f for achieving some other purpose .
Bed016_828	qw	there was this whole thesis on " out of " . ; There was ? ; Well , there I thought or there was a paper on it . ; Who ?
Bmr021_459	b	No if I if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right after I left . ; But , um ; Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_883	s	like Morfix ? ; a a e y you 've got stemmers ? ; Or is that something that ; Um , yeah but it 's all in the in the lexicon .
Bro024_1444	%	Yes . ; So you so you just should look at that fifty - eight perc point O nine percent and so on . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr011_645	b	And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , ; I see . ; one that would go up to thirty - two channels or something . ; Mmm .
Bed011_1168	ft	but it probably is . ; OK . ; OK , great . ; Thanks .
Bmr002_1462	qw	Are we at that point ? ; I think we 're there . ; Good . ; How much space do we have left ?
Bmr016_1660	s	Of " OK " , yes . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that 's the single existing convention for " OK " .
Bed013_1148	bk	Where it is located , we have , a user proximity node here somewhere , ; OK . OK . ; e which tells us how far the user how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity . ; OK .
Bro021_1335	s	Do you benefit from having a better model for the noise ? ; That would be another question . ; Maybe . ; So first question would be to what extent i are the errors that you 're still seeing based on the fact that you have poor boundaries for the , uh , uh , nonspeech ?
Bed008_649	s	Mm - hmm . ; but uh ; so that uh ; Just as a mental note
Bro021_354	b	and when we use the filter that 's derived from clean speech we jumped ; so from eighty - two point seven to eighty - five point one , ; which is a huge leap . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_385	s	And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again . ; You 're right . ; Well , I you know . But sometimes ; Well , we we haven't experienced it before .
Bed011_973	ar	A little bit of data , I ; Is that what it is ? Or ? ; With nothing . ; No , no .
Bmr006_1286	s	Uh - huh . ; OK . ; And you find They get peaks . ; So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag .
Bmr008_1209	ba	if we figure out that these pairwise things are ; Right Well I think being being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of , that ; Well ; So you 're football league was a good one .
Bro028_806	aa	Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper . ; Yeah . ; I didn't see the poster . ; Yeah .
Bed004_613	aa	Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ? ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro013_55	aa	It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? ; Nnn . ; It 's ; Yeah .
Bed015_1120	s	Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive ; you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for ; Yeah . ; um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .
Bro004_1155	b	But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Huh .
Btr001_1983	s	you get this ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; there 's definitely a sense of persona .
Bed004_522	s	and what I think you did is add some rules of the style that are already there that say " If it 's of type " Landmark " , then you take you 're gonna take a picture of it . " ; Exactly . ; F full stop , ; I mean , that 's what you do .
Bro005_1440	bk	You know . ; Yeah , restarting the script basically ; and ; Yes .
Bed014_199	s	Whatever sounds best . ; Uh . ; Does OGI stand for ? Original German Institute ? ; Unfortunately , probably male voices , a bit more research on .
Bro027_449	s	and a hundred , uh , hidden . ; Hidden ; and ; Two outputs .
Bmr003_1408	b	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1076	b	Uh , and , expensive cell phones , exa expensive hand - helds , and so forth , are gonna have lots of memory . ; So it 's just that , uh , these people see the the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market , ; so . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1218	s	Hmm . ; Role , yeah . ; Yeah . ; You know , and so there are various things you negotiate .
Btr001_1447	s	Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . ; Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed , ; and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together
Bro007_449	b	Oh yeah . ; which is which is I guess all the multilingual stuff ; and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only . ; Yeah .
Bro026_603	bc	Or ? ; Uh , w I guess there is , uh , time during which people are gonna make suggestions . ; Oh , but everybody 's gonna have to use the same values . ; After that .
Bed003_1783	g	Mm - hmm . ; And we actually did not want to constrain it too much , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know ?
Buw001_932	s	so we could probably get more as well . ; Yeah . But not not to rely on them for basic modeling . ; That 's true . ; So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me .
Bro028_18	g	Um , ; Yeah . Well , maybe we can start with this . ; Mmm . ; All today , huh ?
Bmr010_634	qrr	because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector , ; which seems really unlikely to me . ; Does anyone , like , know stores ; or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ?
Bmr013_1040	bk	And they work very well . ; Yes . ; So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . ; OK .
Bmr016_727	%--	so we 'll be ; And I guess Espen ? ; This is uh is he here too ? ; May also be working
Btr001_2177	bh	Really ? ; Yeah , ; I trail off with " so " . ; Huh .
Bro021_1043	co	And then how do you go from there to the ? ; This is right . ; And then if I apply exponential , to have here E ; Look .
Bro022_749	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information about what 's going on .
Bed011_158	%--	OK . ; OK . ; That was the uh the data collection in a nutshell . ; And um I can report a so I did this but I also tried to do this
Bmr031_421	s	Yeah ? ; Oh , absolutely you can do it . ; It 's not lossy ? ; Yeah . You can do you can go from anything to anything else .
Bmr001_458	%--	Yeah . ; We don't need all we don't necessarily need it all on - line . ; I mean it will be different subsets . ; So you won't you won't , you know , do all sixteen channels in a single
Bed003_311	aa	but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , ; that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . ; Inferred from the other ones ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_80	aa	Oh , yeah . ; so it could get real real car noise . ; Yeah . ; Oh , yeah .
Btr002_3037	s	Eh Um , so if they go " r e m m " , I 'll go " R " " EH " " mmm " m " M " " M " . ; Oh . ; Hmm . ; So like I I 've been doing that
Bsr001_1807	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr025_538	s	Yeah , I usually delete the ; So . ; I don't , ; Oh ! OK . I didn't do that either .
Bed010_565	s	Mm - hmm . ; Intrinsic , ; yeah . ; While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car .
Bmr018_1062	s	No , it ; right ? ; Because you 'd ; A lot of it 's dominated by channel properties .
Bmr020_1495	aa	Yeah . ; And otherwise they should mark it so that we can check . ; Mark it . ; Sure .
Bro004_1447	t1	whereas , w exactly which HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend uh ; So with that , maybe we should uh go to our digit recitation task . ; And , it 's about eleven fifty . ; Canned .
Bed003_241	s	Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . ; Yes , ; good . ; So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry ,
Bmr031_1002	b	Right . ; Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's an extra step . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr026_773	%--	For both females and males ? ; Yes . ; Oh ! ; Uh , well i there was a little bit of a
Bed009_708	qo	But we are facing of course much more um realistic problems . ; And language input for example , is of course uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision . ; um Then of course , the uh um , you know ; what is it
Bro024_114	s	Yeah . ; Well , I think in a p You know , if if you were going for an evaluation system you 'd care . ; But if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice . ; It 's uh , I think the thing is to get something that 's practical , that that you could really use .
Bmr011_1765	s	so you get some speech and then a " mm - hmm " , and some more speech , ; so that whole thing is one chunk . ; And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , ; that 's where it 's a big problem .
Bed008_201	co	Yeah . ; S probably does . ; Yeah ; someone has to track that down ,
Bmr024_1490	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But there are no boot models , in fact . ; You you 're not booting from initial models .
Bro021_1232	%--	because this is from the dictionary that you have . ; Uh - huh . ; I need to calculate this . ; And for calculate this , I have an I I can develop an expression that is
Bmr010_1446	s	It 's a good method . ; As long as the len as long the segments are long enough . ; Yeah . ; That 's the other problem .
Bro026_1	b	 ;  ; OK . ; OK ,
Bmr028_846	s	But how do you score ? " ; I think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped . ; I mean it 's just an interesting problem . ; That would be a good first pass .
Bmr003_1310	s	Hmm . ; And so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . ; But my script can handle any . ; And their save format can handle any .
Bed013_1236	g	There 's , like , a lot of structure in representing that . ; Yep . Yeah . ; So that seems different from just having the node " location - X " ; and that goes into EDU , right ?
Bmr029_38	s	That 's true . ; It 's more like a day , probably . ; Um , how much worse is the short training set than the large one , in terms of the ultimate performance ? ; Mmm , it 's like Something like three three percent
Bmr028_266	s	Right . ; And for the information retrieval , uh , Don has been working on that . ; So . ; Yeah . So , it 's coming along .
Bns001_800	qy	That 's um normally with if you do a socket programming , it 's directly the prot application protocol on layer four , uh TCP socket , or layer five for UDP socket . ; There might also be some research ; Well , ; could you introduce such a session management ,
Bmr007_223	b	It 's You have ; S n are ; It 'd be interesting ; Yeah .
Bmr019_994	s	but that 's ; When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually very often in w well , I won't say " usually " but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel w which was the person who had asked a question . ; S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? " ; And then there would be backchannels ,
Bed012_303	%--	These three , he wants to know something about it , he wants to know where it is , he wants to go there . ; In terms of , these would be wha how we would answer the question Where - Is , ; right ? ; We u
Bmr014_875	%--	You know , this is this we 're we 're covering ; We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . ; If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache . ; That I think that 's
Bed011_953	s	But uh ; Well , I will tell you the German tourist data . ; OK . ; Because I have not been able to dig out all the stuff out of the m ta thirty D V
Bmr029_134	s	So ; Yeah . So that 's certainly part of the issue , is that right now he 's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency . ; Yeah . It 's it 's in Matlab ; and so on ,
Bed011_457	%--	That w maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category ? ; That 's what I was suggesting for the first round , yeah . ; OK . ; So rather than having zoo and castle .
Btr002_1965	s	So . ; That 's really funny . ; Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that . ; Well , it is There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type ,
Bmr029_322	aa	Yeah . ; I mean , if we had about six A six hour test set 's not bad . ; Right ? ; Right .
Bmr022_1270	s	Yeah . ; Oh , I ; So , maybe there is a way in CVS to effectively lock something if you don't want people to make any changes ? ; At the repository level , there certainly is .
Bed011_24	%--	We 'll see . ; Should we plunge right into it ? ; Yeah . ; So , would you like to
Bns002_1186	s	but this is out of the scope of the of the standard . ; Mm - hmm . ; And ; and Miguel , should I should ask you one question .
Bro012_1077	no	It 's Pratibha that that did this experiment . ; Yeah . ; Um . We should ask which VAD she used . ; I don't @ @ .
Bed003_825	co	y y If If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m ; Cuz they ; Well I can see why ; Let 's get this uh b clearer .
Bro017_709	b	Mm - hmm . ; Or less important , ; so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one , ; yeah .
Bdb001_48	s	um , ; which ; Can I see it ? ; And so the only question is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not ?
Bmr006_1434	b	I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well . ; Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1961	b	Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . ; And I want to try to stay away from that . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1197	s	although if if we , um , look at the result from the proposals , one of the reason , uh , the n system with the neural net was , um , more than well , around five percent better , is that it was much better on highly mismatched condition . ; I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better .
Bed012_623	b	OK . ; Because ; basically , what where we also have decided , prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together ; OK .
Bns002_1181	s	OK ? ; So , if I want to connect to uh , let 's say , Miguel 's , uh Michael 's , uh I I will send him a packet , ; and he will receive it , and that 's it . ; OK , we can build on top of this some uh routing algorithm ,
Bed015_709	s	Anyway , ; right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b ; you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess ; and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever .
Bmr027_27	s	Well , that 's a ; Ugh ! ; So I didn't send out agenda items ; because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item
Bro016_1113	b	Whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way . ; Here 's the signal . ; Here 's some event . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_416	b	And here 's the three types of overlaps . ; Yeah . ; And we 'll we 'll do the labelling for you . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1393	b	This is my second semester and last . ; Ah second and last , ; So I leave ; OK .
Bmr005_1148	s	and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh , just picking uh features , which were uh will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , ; and that 's what Brian was trying to do . ; So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was I was gonna bring up . ; Uh . Let 's see . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent forms ,
Bro024_409	b	The other thing is that and and I I remember B B N doing this , is that if you have a multi - pass system , um , if the first pass ta it takes most of the computation , the second and the third pass could be very , very quick , ; just looking at a relatively small n small , uh , space of hypotheses . ; Mmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr003_1884	%--	Ooo ! ; He 's committed himself to something . ; Ow . ; See he said the word TCL and and that 's
Bro016_194	s	that 's another reason other than curiosity as to why i it would in fact be kinda neat to find out if we 're way off . ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , the other thing is , are aren't we seeing ? Y y ; I 'm sure you 've already looked at this
Bro011_254	s	OK . ; It 's my ; Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , ; I know this is mine here .
Bed006_646	t1	Then uh on to the modeling . ; Right ? ; Yeah , yeah , I guess . ; Um then modeling ,
Bmr019_1512	bk	H i it got it got better . ; I mean , it 's a ; It got better . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1506	b	it 's ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Ah .
Bmr021_424	aa	So . ; Yeah . ; right ? ; Right .
Bed017_301	cc	Well ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , uh , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch
Bmr011_1365	ba	I mean , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches ; Well , tha I think that 's her point . ; Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again ; and that 's a nice idea .
Bro028_824	b	Mm - hmm . ; You have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever . ; And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . ; Hmm .
Buw001_1707	bk	I mean , they 're not gonna easily be able to do that , probably . ; It 's not hard . ; Well ; Ah , yeah .
Bmr018_1503	b	OK . ; and that you could do better with more data , I mean , that 's clearly statistically ; Right . ; Yeah .
Btr002_327	s	That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up , ; because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . That 's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers ,
Bsr001_2565	s	so it 's in a separate room . ; Mmm . ; Right . ; It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way .
Bmr031_405	b	Yeah . ; Forty - four . ; Forty - four one . ; Yeah .
Bro024_432	s	OK . ; Um , ; so briefly , I 'm proposing to do a n a new p approach to speech recognition using um , a combination of , uh , multi - band ideas and ideas , um , about the uh , acoustic phonec phonetic approach to speech recognition . ; Um , so I will be using these graphical models that um , that implement the multi - band approach to recognize a set of intermediate categories that might involve , uh , things like phonetic features or other other f feature things that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself .
Bmr010_1025	s	and that just signals that , um , this is not standard , ; and then in curly brackets " pron error " . ; And , um , and other than that , it 's w word level . ; But , you know , the fact that they noticed , you know , the " nnn " . " He said " nnn " , not " and " .
Bro018_578	s	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; and um and so um , ; what it i at the end of the day , what it actually does is it picks those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary ,
Bmr006_905	aa	Mm - hmm . ; I have to to test , but eh I ; You have your own ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Btr002_1894	b	And then they were talking about like the difference between " uh " when it 's " a " or when it 's " uh " , ; Yeah . ; and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore . ; Yeah .
Bed008_563	2	yeah so lin you can link that up to the ; Should I rename this too ? ; uh yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint uh ; It 's underscore - E .
Bro023_443	b	So , ; uh , this is the single stage Wiener filter , ; with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1005	s	much like HTP ; in a cookie and from the WAP gateway ; then it will be HTP real HTP or something . ; So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection .
Bmr024_836	%--	If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much . ; Yeah . ; So , I mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're ; You can
Bro028_163	%--	Uh . ; Well , it looks strange , ; but ; Yeah . But
Bro025_289	t1	ten ; Yeah . ; So , right now it 's one hundred and forty milliseconds . ; Rank .
Bmr006_1277	s	Correlation , yeah . ; So cross - correlation is pretty sensitive . ; Did - Sorry , b uh I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . He was looking at the two ; Uh , his a web page .
Bro027_659	bk	And so , th ; I mean , if if if a week before we have to be done someone says , " Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now " , it would be pretty frantic around here . ; So ; Ah , OK .
Bmr014_831	s	I ; Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient . ; I 'm just wondering about ; Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .
Bmr014_1082	ba	It just sends me ; So you haven't made it so much fun . ; Right . ; Oh good .
Bro018_1073	b	So . ; Yeah . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bro024_966	aa	Eee - sss - uh . ; So it could reduce the dependence on the amplitude and so on . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_535	b	and then they find this thing is in there ; and we 've already distributed it to someone . ; So , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1484	bk	because we wanna we wanna double mike everybody . ; Mmm . ; Um , it 's also to a large extent , ; Oh , right .
Bmr001_352	aa	So we could actually have eight people with with headset mikes with , I mean , basically no extra effort . ; Well . Five with wireless . ; So we could have eight . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1815	s	But if you had the data and we had a a company . ; But perhaps the company a company that might , uh . ; If you wanted if you wanted to transcribe , you have the ; yes , @ @ you 'll be fine .
Bmr014_283	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So he has a nice set up that they ; it w it will be efficient for them to do that . ; OK .
Bmr007_531	t3	Yes . ; There you go . ; Yeah . ; Thank you .
Bed010_219	b	What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who 's interested , ; we can even make a sort of an internal demo , ; and I I show you what I do , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_95	b	Sure . ; Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . ; Right . ; Right .
Btr002_3149	%--	and that they were stuttering that , ; then I feel fine just you know , writing out the letters . ; But otherwise , I sort of don't feel right trying to write them out ; because I feel like it 's , um
Bmr023_969	b	so now it is . ; So , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . ; It still wasn't a big deal . ; OK .
Buw001_2067	%--	congre congressional hearings . ; Boring stuff like that . ; Um , ; and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in
Bmr016_1182	%--	So it gets " cuz " and " wanna " and that ; And then you gloss them ? ; Yeah , mm - hmm . ; Run it through
Bmr011_1338	b	and , uh , just dialogue - wise , ; Mm - hmm . ; right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1550	no	No . ; I don't know . ; You can I you can mail him later on the informa ; I don't know who he is .
Bro027_946	b	If you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . ; But but it 's It doesn't necessarily work that way . ; Huh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_745	%--	yeah , that was sort of a side issue . ; The issue was that you have to you have have you first have to have a pretty good speech detection on the individual channels . ; I didn't think so either . ; And it 's dynamic , so I guess it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able t to
Bed010_431	cc	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape ; and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this .
Bns001_170	b	then , about publications will be another point , ; and Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that . ; Yeah , it is . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1092	s	like uh uh employing some kind of of uh hierarchical source route routing , ; so you don't have to put all the all the route ; This one , for instance . ; that may that the different parts could be one to number four .
Bmr002_1405	s	Why ? ; I don't know why . ; I had noticed that you were talking quietly , ; It 's bizarre .
Bmr027_1043	s	So the original was " So that 's not so Claudia 's not the bad master here " , ; and then he laughs , ; Web master . ; but it really " web master " .
Bed015_189	aa	Th ; What ? ; Con - uh , a consequent ? ; Yeah .
Bed006_1183	s	Well , it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema ; then you have to say it 's either one of them ; or it can be none , ; or it can be any of them .
Bro021_260	bk	So performance went down ? ; No . ; It didn't . ; Oh .
Bmr030_803	b	Once we have the expanded versions . ; So if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up , ; Oh . ; Yeah .
Bro011_25	b	Yeah . ; So y you guys had a a meeting with uh with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . ; Um ; Mmm .
Bmr005_660	aa	Yeah . ; Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . ; So my my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , beginning and end point . ; Yeah .
Bed016_820	%--	Yeah . ; But , uh ; Hmm ! ; Yeah , so so nob so no one has in in of the ,
Bed008_464	b	And where was the accessible , yeah . ; Well ; accessible I think is different ; Yeah .
Bro026_971	s	We could stop at words , but we don't , ; right ? ; We go all the way down to phonemes . ; Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes .
Bed010_817	s	So , now we 're now done with demos . ; We 're starting to do science , ; right ? ; And so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,
Btr001_688	b	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Um , I find that I have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_1148	s	just change the just , like , mark out the ; Cool . ; Right , a little substi substi ; You know , that 's what text substitution uh macros are for .
Bed004_312	s	So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net ; because I was I I took I tried to conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out ; so what I did was I took ; I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .
Bed015_1422	b	If you stressed , you know , " John went to the " , you know , " the bar " whatever , you 're focusing that ; Mm - hmm . ; and a in a possible inference is " in contrast to other things " . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_809	s	uh ; it combines the categories of , you know , " currently in " ; Oh ! Well , I 've got it right there , I think . ; I I saw the pie chart sticking out ,
Bmr023_901	b	Hmm . ; ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data ; and and and nobody happened to mention it to us , ; Hmm .
Bmr018_150	fa	Chuck ? ; Yes , ; um , ; he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along .
Bro028_504	s	Downloaded the latest version of that . ; Got it compiled and everything . ; Um , downloaded the scripts . ; They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run the system on the Wall Street Journal , uh , data .
Bmr022_803	bk	Yeah , see I I happen to like the old one better . ; You do ? ; But ; OK .
Bro010_1128	s	Yeah , I think it 's an interesting interesting way to go . ; Cool . ; Um , ; I say it like " said - int " . I think it has a number of good things .
Bmr019_1957	s	No , no . ; No ? ; No ? ; Synchronized digits .
Bmr024_941	s	But , uh , the burned ones ; I mean , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year . ; That 's what I ; On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years .
Bro028_483	b	That 's that 's I mean , one one percent is sort of what I would I would figure . ; If somebody was paying really close attention , you might get ; I would actually think that if , you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent error on digits . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_549	s	So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So technically , it 's an overlap .
Bmr029_144	s	and something . ; So ; But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive . ; No . It 's definitely It 's less than a hundred hours , for sure .
Bro004_374	s	Um , but He Mm - hmm . ; I mean . That 's interesting ; because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English , ; because in the other case you don't get hurt any more ,
Bmr015_1162	b	Yeah , so ; But ; u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_485	b	and , it 's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting . ; Mm - hmm . ; So should be a little bit better . ; Right .
Bed009_1030	b	And and we could you could do this . ; And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bro025_347	b	and ; And he says Wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay . ; Yeah . So that 's the one which Stephane was discussing , like ; Mmm .
Bro024_1805	s	There . You know , this . ; Um , ; well . ; If we put everything , we improve a lot u the spectral use of the VTS
Bns001_1290	s	But you have to select it ; because I have a mobile phone , a mobile node or whatever kind of device , ; and I want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet . ; So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with .
Bmr005_535	aa	Some of it 's masking masked . ; Yeah . ; Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ? ; Right .
Bed015_650	%--	I I mean , I I was a little bit surprised about it too . ; I knew that ; Yeah . ; I thought that that would be something like
Bro012_1369	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But we were thinking , we discussed with Barry about this , ; and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT
Bro005_1099	b	Mmm . ; Uh , I mean , I don't know that we need to r ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1642	s	We could get Julia Child . ; I know . ; That 's ; I 'm I 'm actually serious
Bro024_1790	%	Yeah . ; Before I started working on this Aurora . ; so . ; Yeah .
Bro026_708	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's what I got on ; OK .
Bmr002_310	qw	Well , Well , I guess . ; OK . ; Do you So , do you ; What are what are we talking about ?
Bmr003_1249	s	Uh - huh . ; but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor . ; W we 'd like you to do it ; We 'll see .
Bmr003_2372	s	I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it . ; I or the ; N no , ; I 'm I 'm I 'm serious .
Bmr020_1393	b	u u u ; Sorry , go ahead . ; So I was gonna say , EDU - one is good enough , ; Yeah .
Bmr015_551	s	Right . ; and channels and stuff , ; so , it 's a different set . ; Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names ,
Bed013_302	s	I 'm not going back . ; Yeah . ; Either that or I think to myself , I can work at home . ; And then I try to work at home , but I fail miserably .
Bns003_233	co	Um , having uh , I what I have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system . ; That 's my principle concern , ; because that will never be happen , from my point of view . ; It should be started as the edge device ,
Bns001_1507	br	that is not representative , ; Yeah but there 's something needed to sell it . ; it 's only ; Hmm ?
Bmr001_395	s	I thought it was one gigabyte . ; It couldn't be twelve . ; Cuz no , we 've only no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that ; We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else .
Bmr001_436	no	Yeah . ; I 'm sure . ; Yeah . ; I just don't know enough about LINUX .
Bro003_99	s	And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time . ; It 'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day ; and and uh ; I guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst .
Bro022_500	qw	but just not for the task we intended . ; Uh , it gets rid of the speech . ; Uh , gets rid of the speech . ; What does it leave ?
Bmr030_527	bk	You 're just talking about playing it and recording it , like , real - time ? ; bad . ; Yep . ; Oh .
Bmr012_798	s	Yeah . ; It 's about a fifty minute drive , ; right ? ; Well it takes more disk space too
Bmr028_664	s	No . ; I didn't hear anything after that . ; The only reason I 'm asking is , you 're gonna need space to split them up . ; And so I wanted to make sure we had some available for you .
Bmr012_450	s	I was just gonna say , ; Well that 's those are the only we ones there are , ; yeah . ; so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of
Bmr006_1147	b	but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , I don't know . ; Right .
Bed015_1365	s	Mmm . ; So that 's I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , there there are other things .
Bed014_1382	s	it 's you know , it 's sort of a , um , generate and test kind of thing , ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; and if you over - generate then you 'll have to do more . ; I mean , if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use uh , in your initial matching then you 'll match some things
Bed013_1338	bk	and say , that 's all we can activate , based on the utterance out of context . ; Mm - hmm . ; And just by an additional link ; Oh .
Bmr010_470	%--	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know if ,
Bed014_947	%	Oh . ; So we have subjects anyway Except for this week , we have subjects in here . ; That 's why it was one . ; Oh .
Bed016_1111	b	Anyway , I 'm sorry . ; But I think the argument should be uh , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , ; because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical , ; Yeah .
Bed017_138	s	so that I can actually um , look at it more . ; It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . ; Um , ; so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes ,
Bed004_834	s	OK . ; So just from this local construction you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . ; And that may effect the way you process everything else . ; So if you say " how do I get into the castle "
Bro004_946	s	But including the features . ; B b including the features , yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't think this will work alone .
Bmr018_1138	b	aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it . ; Detail , ; Right , right . ; yeah .
Bed012_152	co	Do this in Perl . ; So we get ; OK . ; Let 's assume this is the output .
Bmr018_1244	s	So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance . ; Yep , right right below ; if you feel the back of your head , you feel a little lump , ; um , and so it 's supposed to be right under that .
Bmr011_1009	b	Yeah . ; whether to ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro021_217	s	Huh . Oh , OK . ; and ; and the high - energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise . ; And as the noise you add is the same is the shape , it 's also the same .
Bmr011_1377	%--	So I actually wrote to him and he answered , " great , that sounds really interesting " . ; But I never heard back ; because we didn't actually advertise openly . ; We a I mean w
Bed002_367	s	Now I remember the email . ; OK . ; Huh . ; Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email .
Bns001_765	ba	And you have all the things mapped to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff , in principle , to this technology . ; And furthermore , you see that the trend is to put more IP technology , really , really IP technology , and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations , to their access network itself . ; And ; th there 's a lot of potential , as I believe , for for uh certain research work .
Bed003_197	%--	Wouldn't couldn't they also be ; They 're not exclusive groups , ; are they ? ; Like non - tourist - y landmarks and
Bro018_1010	%	Uh and you can certainly play with that . ; But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first . ; Yeah just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up . ; I don't know .
Bro018_800	%--	Uh . ; Well what I 've been ; " Changes to the data " , ; I 'm not sure I
Btr001_2519	s	Like Well sometimes he 'll do that , ; yeah . ; But sometimes he doesn't . ; And sometimes he 'll just be like uh , you know , um , " Here , Transcribers ,
Bmr011_809	s	at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS ; and that he wants to experiment with taking our data ; and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . ; I I I explained to him in in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript .
Bmr007_1237	ba	Do you do it on all channels ? ; Of course . ; Interesting . ; I like that .
Bns001_901	s	but uh And In in the end of the text in the end of the pr text of the proposal . ; But it is mentioned that it is only an example . ; And that we use this application , in principle , while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things . ; When you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium , or as a partner whatever , who provides this service .
Bed017_359	ba	Because we 're gonna see what what else uh what else we 're gonna do . ; Anyway . ; But uh , ; it 's good , yeah
Bro018_662	bk	there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that . ; or ? ; Oh it i ; Oh , so it is a sigmoidal .
Bmr008_458	s	Where you lived between the ages of ; Yep . Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem ; that it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway , ; and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them " Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to " and so on .
Bmr008_1720	no	The the the the period the the the length of the window to to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone ? ; Is eh in the in the left context as in th in the right context , considering eh the these frames ? ; You mean ? ; I don't know .
Bed009_529	b	Mmm . ; Beyond what 's currently being implemented which is just word lists . ; Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_254	s	Um ; Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation ; and th um , maybe try to train uh , the training data for the t ; tandem network , right now , is like i is using the noises from the Aurora task
Bmr011_205	s	so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? ; Is that what you mean ? ; Or ? ; Well Jane would know more about the transcribers .
Btr001_649	b	I don't know . ; I don't know if that 's actually true ; but I 'm just throwing that out there . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_392	ba	But he pointed out that you don't really have to . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a good point .
Bmr022_593	s	Right . But it 'll it 'll grab the next beep , in other words . ; It 'll be ; You 'll get back another offset . ; Um I mean , I was thinking of
Buw001_185	s	You know , the Jimlet ; I mean , the box that contains the ; Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . ; There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know .
Bmr020_1246	aa	that 's the basic thing . ; and you just use the s the segments of the dominant speaker then ? For for sending to to IBM ; or ? ; Yeah .
Bro023_270	s	um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said . ; And , uh , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network .
Bro008_513	b	And , eh , so there is kind of of not a bug , but something wrong in what we are doing , perhaps . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Right .
Bmr002_495	cc	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; But um , yeah , that 's quite you know we 've That 's been done . ; I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that .
Bmr011_629	b	Yeah . So I think you 'd need a separate a separate set up ; So ; and the assumption that you could time align the two . ; Yeah .
Btr002_937	bk	Yeah . ; But , um ; Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the " shift - backspace " as the collapser . ; Ah . Yeah .
Bsr001_1420	s	But ; yeah . ; Well , i w if we 're gonna have if we 're gonna ; there 's an opportunity to share tools ,
Bmr003_357	aa	There 's definitely ; Yeah , a little bit . ; Oh , they do . ; Yep .
Bro010_469	%--	I don't remember exactly . ; I don't remember . ; Yeah , ; But
Bmr016_1785	b	Yeah you never would put " tickle " in the language model in that form , ; Right . ; yeah . ; Right .
Btr001_2021	s	Yeah . ; and you 're like , " Oh , no , ; Right . ; something something 's going on that I don't know . "
Bro010_856	s	so that 's the product . ; And then , ; um , ; then he has each of these AND things .
Bro027_668	aa	I guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the LVA be in parallel . ; And now he 's he 's requiring it to be done first . ; Well , but I think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . ; Right .
Bmr003_648	ba	and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory , ; which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's that 's the best we can do .
Bmr022_327	%--	and then I guess they have a computer , ; and they have a foot pedal ; which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape . ; I i t i s
Bsr001_1333	s	But it 's like , you know , if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say , " Oh , perhaps the computer could show us this . " ; And you 'd be talking to someone else ; but the computer 's meant to be listening , and so saying , " Oh , ; it means me . "
Bro011_726	x	but uh ; e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . ; So . ; Does anybody know how to um run Matlab
Bmr027_870	b	Yeah . Reply . ; Yeah . ; I don't see there 's a problem . ; Right .
Bro026_1084	aa	but especially if it looks like the potential is there . ; So ; Should we do some digits ? ; Yeah .
Bmr008_329	%--	I don't know . ; It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes . ; Yeah . ; I mean a lot of corpora
Bmr028_1295	s	So therefore , you can , ; um ; Does STM do it per word , or por per utterance ? ; It 's per utterance ,
Bro028_283	b	This is this i this is Stephane . ; Yeah . So that 's that 's ; St - Stephane . ; Yeah .
Bro028_389	s	So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis ; puts in some degradation ; Uh - huh . ; that 's not what we 're used to hearing ,
Bmr016_1453	s	like that have bee has been transcribed to " EH " . ; Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; And sometimes it 's stronger , ; like " eeh " which is like closer to " EH " .
Bmr026_485	b	About half ? ; For all of them . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1202	s	So , you don't need da data enough to cover uh , nearly as much stuff . ; I mean ; I don't know . ; So , really , i What a A Noisy - OR seems to kind of " neural - net - acize " these Bayes - nets ?
Bmr003_2189	s	And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box . ; Exactly . ; This this box ; Oh , I didn't understand
Bed011_1100	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of o our sample sentences , ; the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1383	b	and things covering several screens ; and it 's just horribly i inefficient , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_567	s	If and they 're kind of correct . ; So it 's not done basically . ; Hmm ? ; And they kind of are are correct .
Bmr026_953	s	But then ; And then something ; Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features ; uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .
Bns001_1719	b	Mm - hmm . ; This gets rid of the SDH . ; Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first ; Yeah .
Bed016_649	s	Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; and maybe it is , ; but , um , ; there are idioms
Bro028_217	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's a good point .
Bro012_795	ba	Yeah . Yeah . ; and s channel one is the ; Yeah . ; So C - zero is very clean , actually .
Bed002_711	s	From that task , yeah . ; So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room ; and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . ; So , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry ,
Bmr028_424	aa	That 's actually Well , it 's useful . ; And it demonstrates why it doesn't work , ; because you really wanna go acro more than one meeting . ; Yeah .
Bns001_949	%--	Right ? ; One question . ; Yes , but if if it 's available ; that means
Bro005_344	s	Uh no , not quite that , ; is it . ; Uh , two point six out of eighteen . ; About , um sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition .
Bro016_786	%--	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Cuz if you 're taking the log of these things , it could be ,
Bro028_27	s	and the only topic on the agenda was just to discuss ; a and to come at uh , to get a decision about this latency problem . ; No , this I 'm sorry , this is a conference call between different Aurora people ; Uh , yeah . It 's the conference call between the Aurora , uh , group .
Bmr008_1397	%--	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But are we assuming that you could know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ? ; I mean I can imagine a model where you say , OK , you know I 'm I 'm gonna give myself
Bns002_1390	t3	So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal . ; Should I power off it ? ; Um , just log out . ; OK .
Bmr019_764	%--	So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues . ; Right . ; And another one is turns , like people starting with " well I think " ; and someone else is " well how about " .
Bro019_227	b	It depends . ; Alright . ; If you " Run command " , that I mentioned before , is doesn't know about other things that you might be running . ; Uh - huh .
Bed011_634	%--	Yeah , I mean like for example my my father is about to travel to Prague . ; Yep . ; He 'll be there for two weeks . ; He is going to uh
Bro022_223	b	Mm - hmm . ; And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing ; and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value . ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_1092	b	Now there are some adaptation though , ; OK . ; that that uh , Andreas has been playing with , ; Yeah .
Bro013_61	b	Oh . ; OK . ; Still . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_678	s	Mm - hmm . Some lead time . ; if we want it to ; Ugh ! ; Disk space ,
Bed015_749	s	t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect ; which is , " Oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values " , right ? ; So focus carries along a scope . ; Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't .
Bmr020_570	s	uh , and that was basically it . ; And and we so we wrote this ; and then , we found we were at six pages , ; and then we started cutting furiously
Bmr002_906	s	so . ; Excellent idea . ; So . ; " Automatic annotation of prosody in Verbmobil . "
Bmr006_717	b	I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . ; And , I need t true eh , silence ; for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . ; Right .
Buw001_1281	aa	Yeah . ; Of course Jane doesn't need to . ; I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1052	s	and then ; Yeah . ; Capital Y . ; X . X .
Bmr013_927	s	how long were ; you did one ? ; I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , ; and that was just without looking too hard for it ,
Btr002_2442	bk	That 's more like the " @ @ " . ; yeah , that 's It 's a different noise , ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1202	aa	It might be . ; I ; Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ? ; That 's right ,
Bmr003_1197	s	Um , ; so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it 's cheaper to to do graduate students . ; And there 's another aspect too . ; I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper .
Bed003_1125	s	" Source " . ; That 's that 's quite nice . ; I don't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . ; That might be a bit complicated .
Bed005_961	s	Oh , yeah . ; I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well . ; Uh , so I I 've been in contact with Wu , ; so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , uh , what he 's doing .
Bmr026_331	fa	so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . ; Um And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . ; One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred ; alright , excuse me
Bmr027_987	s	we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um ; We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings ; and they 're downloading the audio files . ; So they 'll be doing that .
Bro027_1881	%--	Well , we just started working with it . ; But these are these are some good ideas I think . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , and the other thing
Bmr008_1332	s	Yeah . ; And the other thing is that , if that isn't @ @ uh so much of the issue , then probably ; Yeah . ; I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different
Bro008_272	s	But , uh , not clear what will go on . ; Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . ; I mean , you can always have another standard after that , ; but this process has gone on for a while on already
Bed005_953	ba	Yeah , I thought I should , um , talk a little bit about that , ; because that might be a good , uh , sort of architecture to have , in general for , uh , problems with , you know , multiple inputs to a node . ; Good ! OK . ; Good .
Bmr031_214	b	You know , I I don't have to time to to do too much these days ; except what I 'm already doing . ; So ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_836	b	I mean , if you if you get at this in this situation that you get this this negative values and you simply set it to zero or to a constant or whatever if we if we would use there a somehow , um a random generator which which has a certain distribution , u not a certain yeah , a special distribution we should see we we have to think about it . ; It 's ; And that we , so , introduce again some natural behavior in this trajectory . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_100	b	What 's a shape file ? ; The shape file is ; If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_3341	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ? ; Oh . Yes . ; Oh , but
Bmr003_883	s	and then we get ; Yeah . ; No . ; Now , there 's a plan .
Bro025_17	ba	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Excellent . ; That 's the best thing .
Bmr021_900	bd	And m my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better . ; Hmm . ; So . ; For for whatever that 's worth .
Bns002_650	b	OK . ; In our scenario , all the nodes are exactly the same . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro013_706	b	cuz he doesn't have code for me . ; So that that 'll take some reading about the theory . ; I don't really know the theory . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_331	aa	Our belief - net thinks he wants to go there , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_847	%--	Well , we have ; If this if this is the noise signal , uh , in the log domain , we have something like this . ; Now , we have something like this . ; And the idea of these methods is to n given a , um
Bed006_807	s	OK , so th ; sorry I just don't kn ; um um um ; This is just uh XML mo notational
Bmr006_261	b	So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . ; Well , the other thing Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . ; Right . ; Uh .
Bmr023_946	qw	So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it ; and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , ; which is great . ; What what is the parameter ?
Bro018_585	qw	So , given these um these features , or or these these examples , um , critical examples , which they call support f support vectors , then um given a new example , if the new example falls um away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being a part of this particular class ; Oh . ; and otherwise it 's the other class . ; So why save the examples ?
Bmr028_766	b	OK . ; Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff . ; And so what I 'm doing is , um , putting in the stream reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files . ; Mmm .
Buw001_1042	b	and you have to hook them up to the recorder . ; So , if they 're already here I think that 's good , ; but if they 're not already here for I 'd rather do email . ; Right .
Btr002_3440	co	OK . ; Transc - And the time is OK . Um , ; O eight . OK , I wanted to make one comment and that is , some of these are like two digits ; and just be sure you say both digits separately .
Bsr001_2352	s	because you what we we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings ; and they 're like one one to five or one to seven digits . ; And people read through them . ; And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them
Bro014_1368	ar	So , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh . Oh , so this i is this the difference here , ; No .
Bro004_206	b	Tas - task data ; we are u ; I I I meant something different by baseline ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1517	s	Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " . ; I know . ; So you take a bathroom break in the middle and and keep your head mount ; You have to turn off your mike .
Bns002_1361	ft	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; many thanks Miguel .
Bro004_61	b	Uh so . uh We So As I was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . ; Excuse me . ; The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_602	s	Right . ; so a printout of the communication between those two fills up ; I don't know how many pages ; and that 's just part of how do I get to one place .
Bmr015_285	s	so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in ; before on on more more higher level , uh , issues in meetings , ; from I guess higher level from my point of view . ; Uh , and , uh , meeting mappings ,
Bro008_380	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr027_514	b	Is is this OK ? And would you please mail you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . " ; So , you know , we can we can do that . ; The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_10	aa	Right . So . ; You 're going to sit there ? ; Is that alright ? ; Yeah , OK ,
Bed010_402	s	I 'm mean , we have no need for that . ; I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code . ; No , ; he 's not gonna do that .
Bro018_451	s	and I asked John Ohala and he agreed . ; Cool . ; Yeah . Yeah . ; So I 'm I I just need to ask um Malek .
Bed017_100	bk	Andy , you actually go by Andy , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr010_288	s	I mean , I 've I 've seen the ; this this is called Praat , PRAAT , which I guess means spee speech in Dutch or something . ; Yep . ; Yeah , but then I 'm not sure that 's the right thing for us .
Bmr027_74	s	Why was that date chosen ? ; You just felt you wanted to ? ; Jane told me July fifteenth . ; So , that 's what I set it .
Bro011_40	b	Oh yeah . ; Alright . ; Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr029_514	s	Right ? ; And ; It 's not just speaker adaptation . ; It 's the whole norm feature normalization process .
Bro008_410	%	So , looking at the data , where , you know what 's the what 's what 's th what 's characteristic ; i e yeah , I think that 's that 's a good thing . ; Does a any you have any thoughts about what else y you 're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time ? ; Uh
Bmr003_234	s	OK , ; so , ; topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription . ; Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services
Bro016_1072	aa	Stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily . ; Yeah . ; Oh , OK . ; Right .
Buw001_2112	bk	But that could change ; cuz Mark you know , Mark 's really into this . ; We should keep in touch with him . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_914	no	OK . ; So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go ; Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . ; I I don't know .
Bmr024_1492	s	But there are no boot models , in fact . ; You you 're not booting from initial models . ; You 're booting from initial alignments . ; Which you got from a different feature set .
Bed005_402	b	Mm - hmm . ; cause some of them ; there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere , ; Right .
Bmr020_583	s	No , no . ; W well , d you couldn't really make everything smaller ; but we s we put ; Put the abstract end .
Bro013_512	b	Uh - huh . ; And this is more or less like this . ; But I meant to have see @ @ two two the picture . ; Yeah .
Bro018_1149	bk	Wasn't it ? ; Mm - hmm , ; or it wa a it was around one . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_53	ba	cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , ; Mm - hmm . ; so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . ; Great .
Bsr001_653	s	So . ; Yeah . ; This is this is ; That that was daring .
Bsr001_964	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , I 'm sure they do . ; They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back . ; They
Bed006_679	2	But what that means is we have here first of all ; on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of Source - Path - Goal actions ; Actions that can be categorized with ; or that are related to Source - Path - Goal .
Bmr022_242	bk	Yeah . ; Well , it 's a thought . ; Interesting . ; Oh , oh , th oh , I see .
Bmr029_915	aa	We 're talking about the training speakers . ; Ah . Right , right , right , right , right . ; No . The training set he could go through right now , and see how how long the ; Right .
Bmr006_683	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_572	s	You can talk to the computer . " ; It 's a lot more believable , too , ; " No ! " ; if you tell them that they 're the computer part is running on a Windows machine .
Bro005_922	aa	" Multi - multi - English " just means " TIMIT " , ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed014_518	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; But , you know , c um almost certainly " can you pass the salt " is a construction worth noting that there is this th this this this uh ; Yeah .
Bmr015_871	s	No , no , no . ; Just just overall ; It 's a it 's a o ; i w the band the band is , eh , from zero to to four kilohertz .
Bmr021_411	s	Because the pointers are ; Y you don't know how much it 's comp ; It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount . ; Exactly . Right right right right right .
Bmr031_1692	s	Hmm . ; I still don't know if these are gonna be any good ; but it sure does get us out of here quicker . ; A one , and a two , and a three .
Btr002_538	b	And now they have those strange computerized voices that n ; So ; Yeah . Those are i a w actually probably just the computer problem ; Hmm .
Bed013_222	%--	a number ; two to the thirty is like a ; Bhaskara said , we had calculated out and Bhaskara believes that it 's larger than the number of particles in the universe . ; And if i
Bmr011_265	s	Great , thank you very much . ; Especially for people with big heads . ; OK . ; It 's makes our job a lot easier .
Bed015_1223	s	let 's see . ; So , ; uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . ; So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance .
Bro005_166	%--	but the result is that the MSG - three feature doesn't work for the Italian database ; because never help to increase the accuracy . ; Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , ; the huge table ,
Bmr007_1007	s	All the Yep . ; Yeah . ; and , um you can control ; It 's a little big .
Bmr001_665	s	I mean like " us " being the Meeting Recorder people or " us " being anything that speech local does . ; Well , I think I think , um , certainly us , Meeting Recorder . ; Yeah . ; Um , us other groups .
Bmr003_1076	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that . ; I see . ; But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle .
Bed013_220	%--	Oh , I was gonna take a drink of my water . ; I 'm talking about billions and billions and billions and ; a number ; two to the thirty is like a
Bmr002_1294	no	Right . ; And I wouldn't be too surprised ; I mean , it 's it 's like uh ; I mean I don't know how how reliable Lea is ,
Bns002_307	%--	OK ? ; So the main idea ; And the media is is is still occupied during that period , ; or ?
Bmr026_942	s	So so that was the other thing . ; Yeah . ; And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . ; So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .
Bmr002_559	s	Or ; Well , every utterance is a single speaker , ; right ? ; It 's just that utterances can overlap .
Bed013_1205	b	because I don't know , it ; Yeah , because we get we get tons of constructions I think . ; Is - uh , ; Yeah .
Bmr029_830	aa	I wonder about that , though . ; I mean , because all we 're doing The only reason we 're using the short training set is is for speed . ; And there we 're not really making any claims about using a smaller training set . ; Yeah .
Bns002_156	bk	Well , eh , the thing is that usually in in a n in a network of sensors , what we have , or the idea is to have um , an important number of sensors , and maybe with a high filer rate . ; Yeah . ; maybe the batteries are uh exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh , let 's say , any sun to recharge its cells , ; OK .
Bmr015_1032	bk	It is but it is if you record it . ; Yeah . ; Except that we 're we 're trying to mimic ; Oh , I see what you 're saying .
Bmr005_692	co	how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ? ; Only . ; Yes . ; Do not mark any other events ,
Bmr022_405	s	Yeah . ; And it might be helpful to them in terms of d act ; Yeah . ; I think it would be ,
Bro014_627	%--	And then let 's try and make everything better . ; Um , ; and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it . ; But ,
Bro019_345	s	And u First I tried just LDA . ; And then I found that ; uh , ; I mean , if if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs .
Bed004_309	s	and we also have a l little bit on the interface , ; M - three - L enhancement , ; and then um that was it , I think . ; So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net
Bro022_739	b	but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things ; because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_708	b	And so we wanna see what we can do with it ; but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it . ; So , ; Yeah .
Bmr010_907	aa	And the the pronun the pronunciations the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard . ; Do whatever you want . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1094	s	OK ? ; So now , if you um try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , ; but I but ; not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response ,
Bed017_671	s	Good thinking ! ; Uh well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this . ; So . ; So I did some double checking
Bmr026_888	b	Right . ; Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . ; I mean , Wall Street Journal , uh , take one example . ; Yeah .
Bns001_370	s	But it could be done automatically . ; But nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible , that you could set up a certain kind of mini - database how to deal with all these kind of things . ; I think that 's not a problem . ; But uh what I I would like to ask Wilbert here , and we discuss it yesterday , " Is it only the usage of that PCMCIA card where you have instead of GSM today , UMTS , and instead of wireless LAN today also wireless LAN .
Buw001_485	s	but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . ; So I was I was just thinking about , um , suppose we wanted to get ; w We have this collection of meeting . ; We have five hours of stuff .
Bed013_698	bh	OK . OK . Too easy ? ; Yeah , mangos go everywhere . ; So do kiwi . ; Really ?
Bmr022_1203	s	uh I mean ; " Key " fi ; Different than what ? ; Well , " key " file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel
Bro007_308	qw	So we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions . ; I see . ; OK . ; And what and what 's OGI forty - five ?
Bmr022_565	s	Or ? ; Right . ; so we 're gonna have to have some kind of ; Yeah , then we just map it to a reject model .
Btr001_2233	s	I thought that was really interesting . ; Or y ; I 've heard you say " so " , in that sort of sense ; like uh , um , " So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . "
Bro024_684	b	Yeah , ; that too . ; It 's a very , very small set , actually . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_622	s	Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , but from the acoustic point of view , it 's all good .
Buw001_197	aap	I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , ; and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . ; So . ; Well , that was just one of the reasons .
Bro016_785	g	Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right ?
Bed015_1265	%--	And they 're bound up in , you know , their bindings and and and values . ; OK . ; W it c ; Do you have to say about the binding in your
Bmr029_405	b	I i ; So when you used original the original models , and you just process the test set in this way , d do you get any do you get decent performance or not ? ; u I I I think , um , for the far - mike HTK system I was using , it did help somewhat . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_1413	s	And so you know , it 's the same as source code . ; You you release source code at some point . ; And , either you have to do everything or you share responsibility . ; Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro projects face this same problem .
Btr001_1258	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Something like that , right ? ; Right .
Bro013_753	s	because here you only have zeros ; No , they just write ; and and people pronounce " O " or zero ; they they write down OH .
Bmr009_835	%--	But I am put I am putting the beginning of the meeting . ; We 've been we 've been messing up your forms . ; I know . ; So you should call it , like , " digits start time " . Or .
Bro014_300	s	You know , figure out how to combine the scores ; Mm - hmm . ; with a weight or whatever , ; and then give you a score
Bmr013_371	s	I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . ; Yeah u I don't disagree with it ; the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , ; i it 's all compromised ,
Bmr028_1409	s	Well , I I think ; But ; We 're not de - legitimizing the data . ; We 're de - legitimizing the experiment .
Bro026_300	s	It , uh , ; In terms of ranking ? ; Second . ; Ri - right now it 's second .
Bro028_627	d	Some ; because I d didn't read also the most recent mails about the large - vocabulary task . ; But , uh , did you do you still , uh , get the mails ? ; You 're not on the mailing list or what ?
Bmr005_181	s	or ; I just wrote this down . ; You just wrote this ? ; Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you had some ideas "
Bmr007_831	s	And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds . ; Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ? ; No . ; I certainly could though .
Bmr026_563	s	Well . ; So . ; Which ; But this this is a very specific question for me .
Bed014_1006	b	The multiple meetings ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; yeah .
Bed003_1748	aa	I want that on a T - shirt . ; Um I think it 's it 's it 's I mean ; experimental setup u on the technical issue ; yes ,
Bro005_1186	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; I mean i i e The um I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA RASTA , ; which is a kind of LogRASTA ,
Bmr005_1044	ba	Actually I have o ; I I would really like someone to do adaptation . ; Mm - hmm . ; So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .
Bmr018_1649	s	and then there 's people saying , " Oh , just add more data . " ; Yeah . ; So , ; And there 's cost !
Bro014_521	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And if we look at the result that Sunil sent , just putting the VAD in the baseline improved , like , more than twenty percent , ; Mm - hmm . ; which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like , well , more than sixty percent improvement on
Bed002_132	s	Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . ; This is a mock - up of one . ; Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . ; Um . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting ,
Bmr011_144	b	How am I d ; But we have more than one type of ; I mean , for instance , you 're ; Yeah .
Btr002_401	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I don't know where the rest of it came from . ; Uh , " groups of " ,
Bed005_550	ba	No . ; There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ? ; No , this is very straightforward . ; Great .
Bro022_697	bk	but use the SRI system instead of HTK . ; That 's ; Yeah . That 's what I wanted , just , uh ; Yeah .
Bed004_137	%--	Is she mispronouncing " Anlage " ? ; Is it " Anlaga " or " Anlunga " ; They 're mispronouncing everything , ; but it 's
Bed009_224	s	Walk a scenic route ? ; and so forth . ; There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . ; And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role .
Bns001_1254	s	You have to have in mind always the end to end scope . ; And if you see , for instance We have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things , u ; especially also for Multicast , ; different things really for different providers ,
Bro021_596	s	So , I mean , I I guess that was something I could say would be that we 've talked a little bit about ; you just doing it all with complex arithmetic ; and , uh ; and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase .
Bmr026_320	s	And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , ; but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways . ; Yeah . ; Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too .
Bro025_57	s	uh , uh . ; Um . ; Mmm . ; So , it probably doesn't matter that much either way .
Bro005_390	s	Maybe for that . ; Hmm . ; Mmm . ; It 's still
Bro005_1382	d	that 's good . ; OK , everyone h must contribute to the our our sound sound files here . ; OK , so speaking of which , if we don't have anything else that we need ; You happy with where we are ?
Buw001_404	%--	which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . ; But , uh , ; I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . ; But it 's not
Buw001_2216	s	which I thought was worthwhile . ; I had a real revelation about taking pictures . ; I don't know why ; I didn't do this before and I regret it .
Bro021_35	aa	This is what what do you , uh what 's in the paper there ? ; So it 's the paper that describe basically the , um , system that were proposed for the Aurora . ; The one that we s we submitted the last round ? ; Right , yeah .
Bed016_343	s	Right , ; um . ; " Future activities " something . ; Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons ,
Bro003_546	s	No , between TIMIT and the the digits . ; Oh , ; um , right . ; Well , there 's a mapping from the sixty - one phonemes in TIMIT to to fifty - six , the ICSI fifty - six .
Bmr006_1445	s	Yeah . ; Yeah ! ; Hats ? ; In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .
Bed015_61	s	What I was gonna ; So something like , um ; Right . ; Well , there 's an example
Bns003_246	ba	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; I mean , how can this use , uh , within this area , and how this area is then aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself . ; That 's my question . ; And I think that is good a research area ,
Bmr016_61	g	Wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something . ; No , I spoke with Jane about that ; and we sort of decided that it 's probably not an issue that ; We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ?
Bmr011_1154	s	Four speakers , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday
Bmr008_1657	b	That 's hard . ; But but I I think that this is a good first thing , to just sort of see . ; And and what this says is that th that without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here . ; Yeah .
Bro017_981	%--	Mm - hmm . ; That 's a way to increase the yeah , n ; That 's interesting . ; So in fact , that would be
Bmr006_643	s	Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . ; Um , someone deleted something somewhere . ; And so we have some room again . ; And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings ,
Bro024_1203	bk	So that threshold ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bed002_680	b	Mm - hmm . ; But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still ; Right . ; Right .
Buw001_1275	%--	and then ; Yeah . That 's why I was wondering . ; So ; Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done
Bro013_361	g	Yeah . ; Oh . ; Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , ; didn't they ?
Bro004_124	s	Mm - hmm . ; I don't have the numbers in front of me , ; But Yeah but I did not uh do that . ; so I 'm just imagining .
Bmr026_1131	b	What about uh hidden unit size on this . ; Oh , wait a minute , ; and the other thing uh , ; Oh .
Bro003_1395	aa	well ; So you 're just having a problem converting the labels . ; It 's it 's ; Yeah .
Bro019_1025	%--	So they 're making ; there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ? ; Yeah , yeah . ; Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ?
Bro003_316	s	Oh yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra . ; Mmm . ; So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand ,
Bro012_1257	%--	but something having to do with the voice activity detector ; and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something . ; It was gonna be a ; That But
Bro014_1140	b	Oh . ; OK . ; It 's something that 's like a a a train of p a pulse train for voiced sound ; Yeah .
Bed002_1067	s	I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , ; and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , ; that are contained in the data , ; um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features
Bro015_227	%--	So , and ; OK . ; Yeah , apparently , um they had better results when they increased the number of states . ; From from eighteen to twenty , or
Bmr031_432	%--	I mean Just for transcribing it , you mean ? ; It 's just like ; Yeah . ; So u u u
Bmr027_1062	s	Um . ; Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . ; That 's the next example , ; the next one .
Bro019_176	bk	so , um , ; you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , ; uh , just because then it would keep other people ; Oh ,
Bro024_880	b	Yeah . ; I mean , it it was just an idea . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_814	s	but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? ; now with a human operator . ; And so , you have basically the same tasks again , ; just with different objects ,
Bro016_1134	cc	um ; and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses . ; Um , ; eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , CMR co - modulation release .
Bed004_346	bc	or they were hurried . ; That 's kind of related to that . ; And then um in terms of the source , the things uh the only things that we had on there I believe were whether ; Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one
Bro011_117	s	and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot . compared to the to the uh standard RASTA filter . ; Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , ; Right . ; yeah , it removed this mean .
Bed011_1069	b	So that the the trick is going to be t to take this and pick a some sort of lattice of constructions , ; Mm - hmm . ; so some lexical and some phrasal , and and , you know , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed012_219	2	or the Tell - me - something - about . ; You can come in if you want . ; Yes , it is allowed . ; As long as y you 're not wearing your h your h headphones .
Bro014_1207	bk	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; So , I mean , i t t ; I see .
Bro028_939	s	And ; and then Barry can say something about what what we 're talking about . ; OK . ; So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , showed up this week .
Bro014_241	s	Mm - hmm . ; Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on ; uh ; well , to to combine error rates before computing improvement .
Bed002_1113	g	So , yeah , we 're sort of committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . ; But that 's , you know , not a big deal . ; Who isn't , ; nuh ?
Bmr031_1603	b	like ? ; Right , right . Right . OK . ; So it is distributed in a way that you can do this . Yeah . OK . ; Mmm .
Btr002_2395	s	Hmm . ; I can't remember the name actually . ; OK . ; The the one that I 'm thinking of ,
Btr001_2673	bk	Oh , ; Hmm . ; that " read O or read zero " . ; Oh .
Bed003_1141	b	Yeah I know there is an I was looking on the we web page ; and he 's updated it for an XML version of I guess Bayes - nets . ; There 's a Bayes - net spec for in XML . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_949	%	Now , we have um just , I think two more short things . ; OK . ; Um , y you guys sort of started fighting , uh , on the Bayes - net " Noisy - OR " front ? ; Hmm .
Bed015_627	bk	One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . ; So " hypotenuse " , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro027_1781	ba	So that you bring in some information from the net itself . ; Right , ; OK . ; That 's a good point .
Bmr023_93	s	That 's cool . ; Yeah . ; So , the choice is , uh , which which do we want more , the the the comparison , uh , of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that ? ; It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .
Bmr016_1412	%	It does . ; Arg arg - max , arg - min , ; Mm - hmm . ; yeah .
Bro007_360	b	um I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one , ; right ? ; I mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best ; Yeah .
Bmr025_921	b	I mean that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened ; is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed005_315	b	some things , ; and it 's very flexible . ; I 've just tried to ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1148	s	Hmm . ; Yeah , I don't know . ; Right . ; But it I I I I think it will be important .
Bed005_640	2	Yep . ; So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this , ; and the uh , description ; With sugge yeah , suggested improvements
Bed004_84	b	Should I go first , with the uh , um , data . ; Can I have the remote control . ; Thank you . ; OK .
Bmr025_33	bk	Yeah I mean , it 's in the same place it 's been . ; So can you just ; Oh , it is . ; OK .
Bmr027_901	s	or how many ? ; Six . ; Six ? ; But , no of different people .
Bro003_1915	bk	but as soon as you will have more words , ; well , words can differ with only a single phoneme , and which could be the same , uh , class . ; Well . ; I see .
Bmr007_458	aa	Right . ; And that 's interesting . ; Right . ; No , I I agree with that .
Bro008_375	aa	and they 're trying to connect to something . ; Mmm . ; Um ; Actually , yeah , it 's very close to clean speech training because , well , because the close microphone and noisy speech testing ,
Bdb001_1190	s	So , we had these two different versions which were you know , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical . ; So it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations . ; Yep . ; I I don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that .
Bed009_721	%--	Hmm . ; How 's it ; unless ; and it 's
Bmr024_1378	s	I mean , if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area ; We prune very conservatively . ; I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um we could probably tighten the pruning without really ; So we we basically we have a very open beam .
Bmr001_776	b	Yeah . ; I mean there 's it 's If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this , probably . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_822	aa	Yeah , you mean ; So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech . ; Yeah , be ; Yeah , that 's fine .
Bed015_545	b	I see right . ; We 're not saying What 's hypothetical about this world . ; In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . ; Hmm .
Bmr027_1034	s	OK . ; So she 's right to be uncertain . ; Oh . OK . ; And it 's also a g a good indication of the of that .
Bmr006_509	t3	Oh , that 's fine . ; OK , see you . ; OK . ; No .
Bmr025_847	no	and so forth ; so and and Jane is more into it ; but eh uh ; you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time
Bmr007_554	s	But maybe a just a small overlap ? ; More , yeah . ; It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction . ; I was just thinking more in terms of alignment , alignment overlap .
Bns002_1470	s	um with some work ; that we put the pieces together . ; Because I believe many are very flexible here ; accounting also the future - coming uh joining people of the NSA group , to do some work here .
Bmr003_1729	%--	sometimes we had the situation which is you know , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance , ; Mmm . ; and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , to indicate that it was continuation ; but it wasn't
Bmr003_346	s	This fan 's wired backwards by the way . ; Uh , I think this is high speed here . ; Yeah , it 's noticeable . ; Well , not clear .
Bro025_114	co	And and , uh , we said , uh , take a week , go arm wrestle , ; you know , ; Oh . ; figure it out .
Bro021_558	cc	And also I 've been talking to , um , Andreas and Thilo about the , um , SmartKom language model ; and about coming up with a good model for , um , far mike use of the SmartKom system . ; So ; I 'm gonna be working on , um , implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far - mike system
Buw001_1068	s	I would s ; Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , ; Yeah . ; that that y that you can't certainly can't require it
Bro003_2088	qy	Right ? ; Linear outputs ? ; Linear outputs ? ; Isn't that what you 'll want ?
Bro019_472	bk	So , uh , ; So the baseline itself improves by fifty percent . ; Yeah , by fifty percent . ; Yeah .
Bro014_851	s	Um ; Yeah . ; We have here some histogram , ; but they have a lot of overlap .
Bed005_1284	s	This is part of what Dekai was doing . ; So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that . ; Right . ; And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher ,
Bed005_304	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; And the value of the score is , v I assume , I guess , the more of these optional things that are actually in there , the higher the r score it is . ; OK .
Bmr012_810	aa	Yeah , I ; and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is ; Yeah , I can imagine it would be ; Right .
Bmr019_1908	s	Simultaneous one ? ; OK . ; Remember to read the transcript number , please . ; And you laughed at me , too , f the first time I said that .
Bed003_563	ar	Oh the ; Yeah , we could . ; But the demo doesn't work very well . ; No ,
Bro012_1007	b	Mm - hmm . ; but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do , ; if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_1572	s	um , of a complex value and its conjugate . ; Um . ; So for each ; And if you look at that on the unit circle , um , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , I think .
Bmr027_988	s	We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings ; and they 're downloading the audio files . ; So they 'll be doing that . ; Chuck 's Chuck 's , uh , put that in .
Btr002_2460	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , " mouth " is fine . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_905	%--	Yeah . ; So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , ; um , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna ; n
Bed008_11	b	Nancy is uh currently in Berkeley but not here ? ; Nancy 's still stick ? ; Don't know . ; OK .
Bed005_893	b	Mwa ; um , this has been a a a Deep Map research issue that was is is part of the unresolved , and to - do 's , and something for the future , is how can we sort of run our our text , our content , through a machine that will enable us , later , to retrieve or answer e questions more sensibly ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_992	s	Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the web ; so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . ; And , um , then once , uh , ; th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings
Bed010_1036	bk	A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh ; Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed014_1117	bk	You just ; I already sent you my fi my bib file . ; So . ; OK .
Bmr007_484	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; I mean , children don't adjust so well , ; I mean , if a truck goes rolling past , adults will well , depending , but mostly , adults will will will hold off to what to finish the end of the sentence till the till the noise is past .
Bed015_1475	%--	I mean , that 's not allowed here . ; Yeah , but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , ; because " you " , " me " , " he " , " they " , ; you know , " these guys " ,
Bmr008_1128	aa	Oh yeah , OK . ; So thi Isn't this an open - ended , like basically a notes column ? ; I mean you can imagine wanting you should be able always to attach some notes to ; Yes , shirt certainly .
Bro024_704	%--	So , ; that that 's the that 's about the results . ; And , uh , ; the summary is like
Btr002_664	bk	I see what you 're saying . ; a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech . ; Right . ; Right .
Bed005_869	s	And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all . ; Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves .
Bmr012_630	s	or maybe it 's not ; maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something ; and and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that ; that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit
Bro004_836	qh	and and we 'll see . ; But but what I 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know , ; Mmm . ; what do we do in four or five days ?
Bro027_1957	b	Hmm . ; but ; Well . ; Hmm .
Bro012_1508	s	But I just thought that was a little odd , ; that there were no two or three long ; Sorry . ; So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which um , you know , had it 's separate path for each length digit string you could get .
Bed014_1011	%--	Right . ; And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . ; Yeah . ; So , you know , I mean .
Bro016_508	b	Uh , ; and it is true that the performance , uh , on the German was ; I mean , even though the improvement wasn't so good , the pre the raw performance was really pretty good . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1005	%--	I mean , i the ; Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other ; Mm - hmm . ; but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do ,
Bns001_296	bk	And you can build a a an a a double technology adapter , too . ; So you can market these double - technology adapters . ; And , this can be a a potential uh um you know , uh , income , too . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_585	aa	uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . ; Does it uh ; With By Jane . ; Yes .
Bmr009_800	s	So don't fill these out . ; Alright . ; This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like . ; So , they incorporate the changes that we talked about .
Bed009_1039	s	and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity . ; So a typical one in this formulation is a container . ; So this is a static thing . ; And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers .
Bmr022_249	s	But yo I guess you 'd still get the mistake that you mentioned , ; because the person ; Well ; I mean , if that 's some of the errors , those would probably stay the same , regardless .
Bmr009_1278	%--	You know . ; They might say " Other " for Region because they don't know what category to use ; Actually ; but they might have something
Bns001_952	s	that means ; so so if uh if it 's already part of the UMTS standardization then uh it 's immediately finished , ; like , OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ? ; And if it 's not in there yet well , it could be a suggestion
Bmr022_1343	s	And I I think that it 's , um , ; I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made . ; And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate . ; But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions .
Bmr018_151	s	Yes , ; um , ; he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along . ; Uh , oh I I think I mentioned at the last meeting ,
Bro016_430	s	So so , I I think it 's good to pause , and to gather everything together and make sure it 's in good shape , ; so that other people can get access to it ; and so that it can go into a report in June . ; But I think to to really work on on fine - tuning the report n at this point is is probably bad timing , I I think .
Bmr022_1294	s	In ; The Maybe the model ; It 's a little bit different in CVS . ; When you check something out , you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it ,
Bro024_600	s	The " Car " ? ; Oh . ; Still it still , uh that that 's still consistent . ; I mean , I get the best performance in the case of " Car " , which is the third column in the A condition .
Bmr030_467	b	Yeah . But if it was at your desk or something ; But ; Yeah , but you ; Yeah . Pfff . Yeah .
Bmr016_1266	s	and wo some of them are laughs and breathes , ; so we have uh that 's prepended with a v a tag of " VOC " . ; Whew ! ; And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings ,
Bmr008_567	s	what about just doing the the sort of the Steve suggestion , uh , as as an add - on to it , ; right ? ; Rather than saying Region , just say " Where did you live between the ages of here and here ? " ; That was the concept of region .
Bns003_801	s	afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm yeah , funded by an institution of the German government , ; so , ; they are paying me , ; and I have to do research for them , of course .
Bmr019_187	s	Yeah , bu although I 'd be I think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system ; so that these numbers were comparable ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , Adam knows how to run it ,
Bmr010_1180	b	which is completely gross . ; Wrong . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1188	s	Yeah , but we didn't have the exact comparison . ; It ; But you know , there were i i ; the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts .
Bmr026_788	s	With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that . ; So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .
Bro028_175	s	and ; Yeah . ; Mmm ; Are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that .
Bdb001_815	aa	Yeah , but that 's gonna be the trouble no matter what . ; Right ? ; No matter what format you choose , you 're gonna have the trou you 're gonna have the difficulty of relating the the frame - level features ; That 's right .
Bmr029_91	aa	Whatever comparison we w w one would presume . ; Mm - hmm . ; But we don't know how much worse , ; Right .
Bmr007_105	s	Oh , ; th That 's the per cent . ; Mmm . ; So , six is , uh two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session .
Bsr001_1405	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; Someone will make some assumption that 's different than someone else . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2433	s	Cuz I think I had talked to you about this about ; what what did we do cuz wha what was it that I ; oh , I was ; " Lipsmack " !
Bmr008_1527	b	And he has on his graph something like forty percent . ; It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap ; It 's li I think the last page . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1133	s	you know so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right . ; Well the the the utterance was " is there a bakery around here ? " , ; But having them separate ; not " I want to go to a bakery . "
Bed002_698	bk	That 's what we 're doing . ; So that 's what you want ? ; But but we will still get the phrasing all over the place . ; OK .
Bmr020_887	ba	Oh ! ; OK . ; So what what we 're probably gonna do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them . ; Ah , interesting .
Bed005_528	ba	even though it you can't see it on on this resolution . ; And this is what it sort of is the the structure of Map requests , ; um ; also not very interesting ,
Bmr009_318	aa	but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , ; right ? ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_1280	qo	Right . But but If the segments change , that won't work . ; Y Yeah . Yeah . ; You It 'll sort of work , but it 's not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition . ; Well , I mean , what happens if you break one segment into two ?
Bed008_154	s	Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this is not just a display , ; this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end .
Bed011_874	s	Um " Object information " , ; " Do I do I wanna know anything about that object ? " ; is either true or false . ; And . if I care about it being open , accessible or not , I don't think there 's any middle ground there .
Bmr009_768	s	but maybe not just now . ; But , uh , should talk about our options as far as the uh uh transcription ; But . Well , w But we 'll do that later . ; Yep , if IBM doesn't
Bmr003_922	s	No , no . ; You wanna know given Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well ; Yeah . ; I mean , the the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ?
Bro027_2025	t1	Let 's see , ; twenty - third , ; thirtieth , ; sixth .
Bmr006_296	s	Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but ; I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .
Bmr010_910	s	Yeah . ; No . ; They actually are ; uh , it 's just a single , s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation ,
Bmr006_260	b	Yep . ; So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . ; Well , the other thing Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . ; Right .
Bmr016_1767	g	w ; yeah , but it so it 's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of " tickle " . ; Well " tickle " was pronounced " tickle " . ; Right ?
Bmr006_497	aa	That 's right . ; Well put . Well put . ; So , after the transcript screening phase . ; Yeah , that 's true .
Bro005_109	s	And , ; fff um , ; yeah . ; What we see is that these nets are not as good ,
Bmr019_401	aa	Yeah , I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like . ; can't quite seem to ; Yeah , I think this contraption around your head is not working so well . ; Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah .
Btr002_895	s	and then " shift " ; and then " shift " ; " shift " , what is it ? ; " backspace " .
Bmr013_1010	s	Hmm . ; And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . ; It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , ; so we 'll see if it 's any good .
Bro012_161	bk	Yeah ? ; and . ; OK . ; That 's right .
Bro018_361	s	But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value . ; Yeah , it 's pretty funny looking . ; So they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two . ; I don't know .
Bed013_873	qw	Yeah . ; Anyway . So , what 's going on here ? ; So what are what ; Was wollte der Kuenstler uns damit sagen ?
Bmr020_517	s	and the end of a discourse marker . ; And we just eyeballed ; I mean we didn't really hand - tag all of these things . ; We just looked at the distribution of words ,
Bmr027_1193	b	Yeah , that ; We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually . ; I 'm using one of these . ; Yeah .
Bed004_338	s	And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .
Bmr011_692	%--	Yeah , so it 's , uh , people people getting shy about it . ; Yeah . ; There 's this human subjects problem . ; There 's the fact that then um , if
Bsr001_1987	b	So probably , uh , on the ; Um . ; Well , so we haven't even you know , we haven't collected a byte yet ; Right .
Bmr011_1343	b	And then the other thing is , ; I don't know if this is at all useful , ; but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building ; Yes .
Bro003_942	s	it 's preparing . ; pre they are preparing it , ; and , well , ; They are preparing .
Bro005_1441	bd	Yeah , restarting the script basically ; and ; Yes . ; Yeah , I 'm familiar with that one ,
Bed005_1190	%	So , specifically in this case you have to f have this many numbers , ; whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . Right ? ; So you have to have just three N ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1267	s	And have ; yeah . ; Oh . ; Have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me
Bmr026_734	x	Yeah . ; We feel We feel obligated to collect more data . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed002_235	s	and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . ; If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , you have to go this way , and go up here . ; And there you have a vre really view It exploded , the during the Thirty ; years - war . Really uh , interesting sight .
Bmr030_821	s	Yeah . ; Well , he David 's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think he wants to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these .
Bmr025_328	b	and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , ; but but um , ; uh and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_468	bd	OK . ; It 's gonna require some coordination . ; Then it would go like h twice as fast , or a third as fast . ; Anyway , it 's just a thought .
Btr002_2837	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; But , ; I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption .
Bmr003_1493	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Huge amounts . ; It was at the beginning .
Bed015_1182	s	How do you link them up . ; And I think again , um , it 's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you " is this static or is this dynamic " . ; So we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . ; Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ?
Btr001_418	b	but I know that in France for example Parisian French is much easier for me to understand ; cuz I learned it ; versus France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like the villages in the south , ; Sure .
Bmr027_697	s	as well as all of these . ; Yeah . ; Wow . ; Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .
Bro010_734	b	It 's not gonna stay absolute the same . ; If you if you check it out , uh , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road ; or whatever . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed004_330	bk	Yeah , there 's just one more node and it says " Mode " which is the decision between the ; Yeah . ; OK , great . ; Alright .
Bmr021_853	%--	Um and so ; Yeah , and and then there 's all these ; um ; You know , the number of um
Bmr013_561	x	uh , ; that might be interesting . ; He 's got lip lipsmacks . ; In the meetings .
Bro013_63	s	Still . ; Mm - hmm . ; But but uh what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should uh take ; I guess that somebody 's gonna do this ,
Bed005_947	bk	the e sort of , Johno and I will take up that responsibility , ; and , um , get a first draft of that . ; Now , we have um just , I think two more short things . ; OK .
Bmr005_533	b	And so if you 're interested in ; I I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem , ; Some of it 's masking masked . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1378	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; So , if you look at on this page that has uh frame energy ,
Bns003_443	s	that 's a ; We have the we have the directory structure , of the real UNIX tree . in compliance and in accordance with what you with the structure of the web pages . ; And , um , that means , uh , the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages . ; He has access to the N S A pages .
Bro027_1449	%--	but you also take the path that that doesn't have that , ; Uh - huh . ; and putting those in together . ; And that that seem
Bro023_506	bk	which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up . ; So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice , ; but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level . ; OK .
Bmr005_973	bk	No . ; Nope . ; No , so the the that 's the that 's the biggest one uh , chunk so far , ; OK .
Bro018_598	s	Mmm . ; Right ? So so it I mean I I guess it 's ; Sort of an equivalent . ; You know , it it goes back to nearest - neighbor sort of thing ,
Bmr018_1714	bk	We @ @ let 's try that again . ; Yes ! ; Yeah , that 's good . ; OK .
Bro022_847	s	and , ; uh , ; from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . ; So it removes the first silent portion portion of each utterance .
Bro022_710	bk	We would have to train on ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1168	s	So . ; When Yeah . ; When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center . ; Uh even when there is absolutely nothing to to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in in Berkeley .
Bmr020_604	s	Uh - i i do you rem ; y We didn't talk about , uh , prosodic , uh , properties at all , ; Right . Right . ; although that 's I I take it that 's something that uh Don will will look at
Bed016_284	b	the you can observe that all the time , ; Oh really . ; they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine . ; Interesting .
Bed015_380	g	M moving it to another place , right . ; Yeah . ; OK , so that 's ; But there does basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ?
Bmr001_245	bk	Right . ; But I think that if my point is I guess if you if you have a um a uh s a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer , there clearly are ways to get more out of it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed005_1091	g	We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? ; So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? ; and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ? ; Right ?
Bmr021_655	%--	really easy . ; And this is not ; Oh , I 'm sorry , ; I I just
Bed006_1120	%	You have a further specific intentions to left to lift your right foot ; Hmm ? ; and so uh uh I mean y you really have to focus on on on ; Right .
Bro027_1502	ba	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; No , well , that 's a good idea .
Bmr016_692	b	and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps , ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . ; Yeah .
Bro023_263	%--	Um . ; S so , um , ; the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ? ; Or ?
Bro027_1839	h	but I I guess ; But if you were gonna put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , ; right ? ; Um ,
Bmr026_552	b	Yeah . ; No . ; I think Dave Dave knows all these things , of course . ; Right .
Bed005_144	b	Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we noticed that whatever we tried to do , it no effect . ; OK .
Bro005_480	s	but let 's let 's consider what that means . ; What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that ; I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . ; When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training .
Bro019_861	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; How is it
Bsr001_1510	bk	Hmm . ; that was , you know , w we 're not uh planning to do anything with with all that like right away . ; So if there were is there you know , we h we 're happy to take input on that . ; Right .
Bmr007_683	t3	But . ; Or , this is getting a little extravagant , we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove , uh visual contact . ; Yeah . ; Barriers !
Bed002_383	s	But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . ; And , so that 's that 's the quote " deep " that we 're trying to get at . ; And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to ; Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it .
Bro015_98	s	This week I 'm I am begin to to write the report on ; I stopped it . ; Ah . You stopped working on it ; Interfered .
Bmr006_1244	%	so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . ; That 's That 's fine . ; But th I don't think that matters , though . ; But
Bmr009_462	s	Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel , ; cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel . ; Mm - hmm . ; And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " .
Bed010_188	bk	Mm - hmm . ; but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr009_769	bk	But , uh , should talk about our options as far as the uh uh transcription ; But . Well , w But we 'll do that later . ; Yep , if IBM doesn't ; OK .
Bed015_387	bk	And so that was the ; Robert 's not happy now ? ; No ! ; Oh , OK .
Bns002_1561	b	so that the UCB is clustered as one uh partner ; but nevertheless with different departments . ; Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro016_779	%--	I don't know . ; That means they 're between zero and one . ; Mm - hmm . ; But i it it it it doesn't necessarily
Bed003_1398	g	OK . ; um which is a question . ; How deep do we want to sear , ; you know ?
Bmr018_621	bk	What is patho what do you mean by pathological ? ; I 'm sorry , I don't ; Just just something really wrong with ; Oh .
Bmr002_908	b	So . ; " Automatic annotation of prosody in Verbmobil . " ; Can I see ? ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1454	b	Mm - hmm , that 's right . ; And sometimes it 's stronger , ; like " eeh " which is like closer to " EH " . ; Mmm .
Bro012_78	s	Huh . ; Well . ; uh ; Well . If they made output
Bmr009_199	s	but he d but he doesn't doesn't ; Right . So , we don't know what they look like on the , tsk For the raw . ; But he didn't h have it for the energy . ; He had it for the derivatives .
Bsr001_2005	br	And we have the same sampling rate . ; Yeah . ; Sampling rate in the end . ; What ?
Bmr021_831	b	I could certainly do that . Yeah . ; Um . ; We could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the ICSI features . ; Yeah .
Bro024_318	s	Yeah . ; Now , you know , maybe you 'd use something from the others ; just because at the beginning of a call you don't know anything , ; and so you might have some kind of general thing that 's your best guess to start with .
Bro016_757	s	I sort of had forgotten to discuss it . ; Um . ; You always have to look at how this uh , these adjustments , uh , affect things . ; And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features .
Bro023_1109	b	plus they do some some smoothing techniques on the final filter . ; The th they actually do the filtering in the time domain . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bed002_707	aa	I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; From that task , yeah .
Bed013_590	s	Pure ASCII lines , ; OK . ; whatever . ; Why , for whatever reason ,
Bro016_367	aa	So , that 's ; Yeah . That 's what you were describing , I guess , a week or two ago . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1620	b	Well , we probably won't get that far . Yeah . ; Yeah . So I think that would be that would be the obvious thing to do . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro028_775	s	OK . ; It 's some kind of a mixture of Gaussians and , uh , clustering ; and , uh ; They 're they 're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays .
Bsr001_1091	b	I 'm not sure how much I should say about it . ; Yeah , that 's what I was wondering . ; So that the , ; OK .
Bmr021_76	s	L Liz Liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them . ; They are ver ; Gosh , ; cuz I much prefer them ,
Bro008_159	s	Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample . ; So , uh , as a result of that we have a reduced , um , transmission rate for the bits . ; Mm - hmm . ; That was misreported the first time out .
Bed009_617	qy	Yeah . ; And he 's gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner . ; Dialogue manager . ; Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ?
Bed013_825	s	OK . ; So that was was that the question ? ; Was that what ; Well that was related to what we were talking about .
Bed006_879	s	there 'll be a certain one , that has its own s structure ; and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching , ; but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're ; whatever ,
Bro017_328	s	so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands . ; That 's what masking experiments tell you . ; But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands ; when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands .
Bro026_841	s	Got anything to tell us ? ; Um . ; Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data . ; Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context .
Bsr001_1182	%--	and that 's sorta how I got involved . ; I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of do something . ; I guess , I My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and how to apply you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition . ; So not just
Bmr025_433	co	Cool . ; Yeah . ; and then also the transcripts . ; And so l just let me know there
Bed004_379	s	whether it 's in the tourbook or not . ; Ch - ch - ch - ch . ; Now . ; Alright , so I understand what 's what you got .
Bmr006_715	s	Mm - hmm . ; Eh , um , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone . ; I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . ; And , I need t true eh , silence
Bro019_1365	b	Yeah . ; So . ; I mean , it doesn't do it very specifically , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1643	s	uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with ; and , ; um ; Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping
Bed006_1584	s	Mm - hmm . ; but yeah sure three is fine . ; Yeah , ; and you can always make it shortly after three probably .
Bmr020_622	b	Well , I didn't know about Liz 's finding on that , ; Uh - huh . ; but I know of another paper that talks about something ; Hmm .
Bed002_770	s	so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that , ; Mm - hmm . ; what suffices and what doesn't . ; And then we can start worrying about where to get this input ,
Bed002_350	s	We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . ; We 'll see . ; And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , ; and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context .
Bmr014_498	s	Okay , good . ; Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . ; I spent um ; actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,
Bro024_1219	bk	Yeah . ; It 's fixed , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro004_491	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK , I see . ; So , seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent .
Bed008_1298	s	So those are the two things that we uh need . ; Hmm . ; So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting ; and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages ,
Bmr010_351	s	OK . So you probably did get that . ; So Brian did tell me that in fact what you said , that , uh that our ; that they are making progress ; and that he 's going that they 're going he 's gonna check the f the output of the first transcription
Bmr028_1427	%--	and ; Which is part of why it 's used . ; to the wr to the wrong audience , I think that that might be t a negative shock . ; Yeah . I thi I think to the wrong audience , I agree that , um , p
Bmr024_255	s	I 'm I 'm hiring people who , uh , really are ; They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . ; Mm - hmm . ; And and I don't think it 's possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible .
Bro018_1002	b	So um ; That 's a difference that I don't think we put any way to get around , ; since it was an advantage . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_110	s	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; So And I also talked to Mari this morning ; and she also had a strong preference for doing that .
Bro023_1333	qw	so it 's like it looks into the future also . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; What if you just look into the past ?
Bed010_984	s	so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . ; We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , ; I 'm not sure . ; It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes .
Bed017_313	b	We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , ; if , when , and how , ; then this becomes foregrounded ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_283	aa	Um ; Yeah ? ; Miguel , can you give some examples for such kind of protocols ? ; Yeah .
Bed015_1820	ba	Mm - hmm . ; Right ? ; Oh , yeah , do we have any ? ; Oh , shoot .
Bro018_899	s	Yeah . I 've been um , I 've been working with um Jeremy on his project ; and then I 've been trying to track down this bug in uh the ICSI front - end features . ; Uh - huh . ; So one thing that I did notice , yesterday I was studying the um the uh RASTA code
Bmr007_140	qw	it would be good to normalize with respect to that . ; Now on the table I did take one step toward , uh away from the raw frequencies by putting , uh percentages . ; So that the percentage of time of the of the times that a person spoke , what percentage eh , w ; so . Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ?
Bed015_107	s	The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . ; It 's it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there . ; Mm - hmm . ; And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it .
Bsr001_1311	b	Pardon ? ; They don't say , you know , " I 'm done , Computer " . ; They only mark the beginnings . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_543	b	Wow ! ; Oh . ; Yeah , the archiving m program does take a long time . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_715	s	And that could be ; Yeah Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Seat number , that 's a good idea .
Bmr016_635	aa	Mmm . ; I noticed that Chuck was wearing the lapel a lot . ; Um , yeah , ; Early on , yeah .
Bmr009_312	b	Well , especially for normalizing . ; I mean , it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_449	s	Construal , ; OK , so ; Oh , so there was one question that came out . ; I hate this thing .
Bmr016_1262	s	Oh I 'm sorry . ; OK so , gloss is things like replacing the full form u with the , um , more abbreviated one to the left . ; Uh , then you have if it 's uh , there 're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words , ; and wo some of them are laughs and breathes ,
Bro018_495	s	Mm - hmm . ; Cuz uh the Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years , ; and ; uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training .
Bmr002_489	s	OK . ; So so the cheaper we can do it , the better . ; Well , ; OK . Well , you also want to get quality .
Bmr024_1132	bk	Yeah . ; And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , ; after you confirm that it 's really backed - up . ; OK .
Bns002_983	s	OK ? ; because of the of high interference levels . ; A lot of simultaneous transmissions also means for each receiver point of view , a lot of neighbors or or nodes transmitting at the same time . ; And , all the transmitters uh with the exception of the transmitter of my transmitter , are my intereferers
Bed012_533	aa	because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes - net for a specific question . ; Like the Endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes - net for Where - Is until after you 've decided whether you wanna go there or not . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr018_930	s	and i and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down ; I mean , i it depends on how lar ; th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or or vice versa . ; It 's not a simple question .
Bro026_922	b	I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . ; And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . ; But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_351	b	We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that . ; Yep . ; But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said " OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop " in terms of querying about some of these decisions . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns003_242	s	and b between these both boxes , I can assume uh because the mobility happens there as a normal natural thing ; and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated , from my point of view . ; And to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism , that the packets can be used to set up the routes because they have all the information . ; They know where they have to go because IP addresses are still there and within the packet .
Bed002_606	s	Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , ; but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , ; given ; these We have all these transcripts
Bmr016_956	s	is that you could run all the English speaking , ; Yeah , it it 's a lot faster . ; all the native speakers , ; Right . You can grab everything with the word " the " in it ,
Bmr015_733	%--	I I , ehm I calculate the the phase derivate using the FFT . ; Yeah . ; And ; The algorithm said that , eh , if you if you change the the the ,
Bro010_400	s	Mmm . ; Uh , I mean , it doe did look like it buys you something over just the KLT . ; Yeah . ; But maybe it 's just the discrimination
Bns003_581	s	Yeah . ; See for me it 's the same ; I can also say , uh , ; for me everything has completely changed ,
Bmr011_735	s	But I just ; Yeah , we we ; you know . ; Well I can't ,
Bro012_1249	b	But we what we ; uh ; I guess we could ; Yeah .
Bro026_571	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Oh , so they 're gonna just deliver a system basically . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro004_600	ar	So that 's matched training ? ; Is that what that is ? ; It 's ; no ,
Bro019_1134	b	I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter , ; yeah . ; the coe the cepstrum coefficient , ; Uh - huh .
Bed003_487	b	But all those things without question marks are also binary . ; Right ? ; Which things ? ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2000	s	because there 's so many voices in my head . ; You mean when you leave here ? ; When you 're somewhere else ? ; No , no . While I while I 'm working here ,
Bed013_250	s	I remember there being some other one floating around . ; But anyway , uh . ; I don't really know . ; Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever .
Bro022_1054	%--	And ; so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . ; So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions . ; And , uh . So . The results are , like
Bmr010_1559	s	N ; and it worked pretty well , ; but I haven't worked with it a lot . ; So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample
Bed005_1464	b	and is a it 's , uh it 's huge , ; but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_953	b	we can already put them on tape . ; OK . ; And the tape is hi is very reliable . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_1066	b	No . ; Uh , Yeah . ; It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1481	aa	That ; OK . ; Isn't that wonderful ! ; Yeah .
Bmr013_853	s	And , then , I run it through , uh , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . ; And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , um , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , um , vary in length . ; And , um , their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long . ; But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them .
Bro028_864	bk	Oh . ; or whether it was FFT bins ; or ; Huh .
Bed012_570	co	Mmm . ; or you just make a p @ @ a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those . ; Yeah . ; So basically , you 'd have a decision tree query , Go - there .
Bed013_323	s	Uh next ; Well , I think we think we 'll see him definitely on Tuesday for the next ; Or , no , wait . ; The meetings are on Thursday .
Bed013_404	s	and how we cognitively , neurally , psycho - linguistically , construction grammar - ally , motivated , envision uh , understanding that " . ; Mmm . ; So we can actually show how we parse it . ; That should be able to we should be able to come up with , you know , a sort of a a parse .
Bro028_1160	s	So maybe just briefly , uh ; Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , uh , the big picture is k um , come up with a set of , uh , intermediate categories ,
Bro003_1456	s	That that 's what I meant . ; Right , ; right . ; And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all .
Bed016_281	s	Yeah . ; But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , ; Oh , OK . ; the you can observe that all the time ,
Bro028_908	s	And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow . ; Uh , not just , ; um , um ; not just subtracting off your estimate of the noise .
Bed013_1452	s	OK . ; First dozen subjects ; Uh - huh . ; just so we can build a a language model for the recognizer .
Bmr010_1537	qw	or or cepstrum or something , um ; Yeah . ; Eee it 's in there somewhere probably . ; But , eh , what did you think about the possibility of using the Javier software ?
Bro022_274	b	And ; So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . ; Uh , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_1371	s	Uh . But , um . Um . ; Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something hasn't , uh ; I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , ; and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner
Btr001_1022	b	It 's really interesting . ; But something like ; and I couldn't get anything . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1351	s	once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . ; I mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . ; And uh and uh a nice amount of memory . ; Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine .
Bmr001_828	bc	That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are . ; Yeah . ; Not in Scotland . ; Inexpensive .
Bmr012_524	s	what 's it a sheep or a goat ? ; A sheep . ; Baah . ; Sheep .
Bed013_311	s	But I did not finish the uh , ; But I 've been looking into it . ; I th @ @ It 's not like it 's a blank slate . ; I found everything that I need
Bed009_1111	qw	OK , ; Yeah , ; yep yep yep yep ; and about the situation about " Is it raining ? "
Bro016_31	%--	Um . ; Do you think that would be the case for next week also ? ; Or is is , uh ? ; What 's your projection on ?
Bed015_1967	qy	Can I ask a quick question about this side ? ; Yes . ; Yeah . ; Is this , uh was it intentional to leave off things like " inherits "
Bro024_1095	co	Mm - hmm . ; OK , ; we 've got twenty minutes ; so we should probably try to move along .
Bed008_660	s	And also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also ; OK . ; Budget . ; User schedule .
Bmr009_1579	s	So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people , ; and it 's likely that uh ; So . And and they responded favorably ; looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .
Bmr019_653	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files . ; Uh ; So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file .
Bmr026_1125	b	Yeah . ; But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance ; I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . ; Yep .
Bro019_1541	%--	don't they , ; to sort of ? ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; But it
Bmr010_1312	s	But , uh , ; a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain , ; Yeah . ; which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features .
Bmr005_527	qw	On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes , ; Yeah . ; so it 's ; But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?
Bmr018_1419	b	um , I mean , it 's sort of a far cry ; because they weren't working with meeting type data , ; but he got sort of an overview on some of the different approaches , ; Right .
Bmr028_98	%--	and the only problem with that is you can't , uh , zoom out on it . ; You can zoom in , but not out . ; What 's a shape file ? ; The shape file is
Bmr012_1301	bk	Super . ; I 'm really sorry I have to g ; no I have to go as well . ; OK .
Bmr027_108	s	Yeah . As I said , we I just got one date ; Damn ! ; Yeah . ; and that 's the one I used .
Bmr005_1345	s	like the room is not the bottleneck , ; and we have enough time in the room , ; it 's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going . ; I think the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path .
Bro012_1239	b	works OK . ; Obviously it 's not perfect ; but ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_253	s	Yeah . ; And so ; Well , this is a point . ; And right now actually there is a thing also , uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number .
Bmr002_380	s	Yeah . ; And I could probably borrow one . ; Well , one th ; I I I actually have one .
Bro026_530	bk	Were you talking about what t new stuff , ; or ? ; What to freeze and then what to do after we froze . ; Mmm .
Bsr001_397	t3	No . ; Not too well . ; OK . ; OK .
Bed002_1268	%--	where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , " OK , this is what it usually does , ; and now we add this little thing to it " , ; you know ? ; whatever ,
Bmr007_794	s	Yeah . ; So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about about two weeks ago , ; and so I played with that a little bit , and it works O K , except that it 's very sensitive to your choice of your filter width and your threshold . ; So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not .
Btr002_639	s	And he was saying in the in the , uh , areas where you have clipping , where it 's recorded too high , and and it starts to saturate and you have trouble , ; Right . ; um I thought that was very interesting . ; So bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower
Bro014_645	%--	And if it turns out that you can't improve on that , well , I mean , then , you know , nobody wins and you just use MFCC . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , it seems like ,
Bns002_1437	s	that , based on the success of the internet backbone , it 's become uh very unflexible , to p uh fo for the provision of these things . ; So , if we are going to offer building blocks , and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks , taking into account , without modifying the end - to - end scope , then I think it 's really beneficial work , ; also for the use of interactive multimedia application , ; so as it is described in the uh project proposal .
Bro028_1184	s	And , um , the other difference is that , um , he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting , ; which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ? ; And whereas in in this case you 're saying " let 's just do it unconstrained " . ; So they 're they 're really pretty related
Bro022_605	aa	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; I guess you used the clean training set . ; Right .
Btr001_2560	s	Oh , no . ; They have this really nice ; You know , it 's really ; Those sorts of things , i it 's true ,
Bsr001_2177	s	Hmm , @ @ . ; I was . ; Uh - huh . ; I don't think we have any problem .
Bro018_506	b	Yeah . ; Yeah and a short short amount of time , ; just to again , just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phones . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_306	s	What are they doing ? ; Well , as I said , I think We don't actually know , ; What , uh ; but I think Chuck 's hypothesis was a good one ,
Bed017_717	s	He said , " for example " , ; this was his only example , ; " if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , ; and as compelling as a video game ,
Bed016_1137	b	Location versus what ? ; instruction . ; Instruction . Oh , directions ? Yeah . ; Sure .
Bro010_807	cc	Um . ; Yeah . ; Well , I 've I 've talked to some of you already . ; Um , but I 'm , uh , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and uh Mazin Rahim .
Bed014_701	b	Uh ; maybe . ; I 'll have to think about that . ; Hmm .
Bmr022_1317	b	Well yeah , there would there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency . ; That 's right . ; And I also like I l also like Liz 's uh , k um , phraseology of " at this level of " I don't remember how you put it , but this " at this level of transcription " or whatever . ; Yeah .
Bed014_103	%--	Um . But we 'll skip that . ; Uh , there 's good news from Johno . ; The generation templates are done . ; So the trees for
Bmr002_1061	ba	So . ; Right . ; It 's WWW dot ETCA dot FR . ; That 's a fine question .
Bed003_62	bk	It 's a needless good idea . ; Is that the idea ? ; Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ? ; OK .
Bmr031_1033	d	Uh - huh . ; And it 's not quite clear always what what it is you mean . ; Which " uh - huh " ? ; Which one it is ?
Bmr023_425	b	Actually , when when they create new yeah , new segments or something , it will be , uh , not that easy ; but hmm . I think one could do that . ; I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks ; Yeah .
Bmr010_774	s	That 's true . ; It just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes , you know , uh , dramatically up , then it might be worth doing . ; Yep . ; And then also the position of the mike also .
Bed016_1072	aa	Really ? ; Of course that 's that that 's definitely a , uh ; Fixed . ; A fixed expression , yeah .
Bro025_475	bk	Yeah . Right now we are ; Uh , ri ; Right now what wha what we did is , like , we just mark we just have this additional bit which goes around the features , saying it 's currently a it 's a speech or a nonspeech . ; Oh ,
Bed009_454	%--	and I 'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration . ; OK . ; Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ? ; So that 's that 's really something we
Bro003_1234	aa	OK , ; Yes . ; again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1603	s	Um , ; Yeah . ; yeah , so the next thing is to use this as as maybe initialization ; and then use something on - line .
Bed003_1797	s	Mm - hmm . ; and the sort of differences there . ; So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday . ; And uh nothing has changed since then ,
Bmr013_164	ar	right ? ; Yeah , I mean we were in the . ; One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? ; Uh , I th no I think we got under a percent ,
Bmr003_939	s	That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations . ; And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future ; Right . ; but if if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there .
Bmr015_649	s	Now , for only four speakers , that 's not gonna be too much time , ; but if it 's nine speakers , then that i that is more time . ; So it 's li you know , kind of wondering ; And I think again it 's like this it 's really valuable that Thilo 's working on the speech - nonspeech segmentation
Bmr028_1373	s	It it only knows what we give it . ; And if w If it knows more than we would really give it when it runs , we call it cheating . ; But it 's ; Yeah , it 's f only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling ,
Bmr013_427	s	But , The but uh where I 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , um , uh , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature . ; OK . ; And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . ; Might not be , you know , exact features that , Jakobson thought of or something .
Bmr025_422	aa	So it 's implicit in in there ; but you have to do a lot of processing to get it . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr009_1301	b	that that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages ; and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups ; and that it 's a huge waste of of space . ; Yep .
Bed010_498	s	We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs . ; Oh yeah , ; OK . ; Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .
Bro028_828	s	You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation . ; They did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points . ; And , uh , ; they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way ,
Bmr013_704	b	If they 're horrible it won't help at all , ; Yeah , great . ; but they might not be horrible . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_981	fa	But d ; do you have gender - dependent models ? ; Actually , no . Th - th ; Sorry .
Bed002_7	%--	Check one . ; And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . ; So , which is my bar ? ; Mah !
Bmr020_380	b	even though there is this back ; Yeah , I guess that doesn't surprise me , ; because , with the close - talking mikes , the the signal will be so much stronger . ; Right .
Bed010_1001	%--	fine . ; And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in in the neighborhood . ; Right . ; Yeah be uh
Bro017_1084	b	and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above , ; and so that was the only work which they had . ; They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_315	s	Do you want to mention something about that c Thilo , ; or ? ; Um , yeah . ; What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , uh , there 's some speech in .
Bmr014_86	s	and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out , ; in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up ; and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing ; and and I 'm sure help out his own time .
Bed004_408	%--	that is , you know , with fill ; you know , actually f uh , fill it @ @ in , then uh ; So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode . ; Well , I don't
Bmr018_402	s	Well , they wouldn't look at it at this point . ; They would just listen . ; They they might look at it , ; Well , the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .
Bmr020_478	s	Yes . ; Uh , so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences . ; Yeah . ; So , the the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second or or actually , several second speakers , um start their " interrupts " , as we call them .
Bmr008_311	%--	So , s can we get ; Mm - hmm . ; Could we put one more thing on here maybe ? ; That 's what I want to talk about in a
Bmr027_927	s	That was exactly right , ; that we had a uh , uh ; I I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . ; Don't have it .
Bro027_45	2	but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . ; Yep . ; And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty . ; S sixty - four .
Bed014_1407	s	You know , and say , let let 's see how far we can go this way . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; And , uh ; Well it definitely makes the problem easier .
Bed016_927	s	Mmm . ; There 's all sorts of stuff going on . ; So ; might be beyond what you want to do .
Bsr001_1315	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Well , there might be a different style of , um a different , actually , style of interaction .
Bmr025_122	s	but it does mean you need to be running a web server . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so it it 's pretty big and complex . ; Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows
Btr002_1374	s	Mm - hmm . ; But , um , ; yeah . ; One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really , really , really long utterances , it 's extremely inefficient to do anything .
Bmr027_853	s	it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions . ; No , no . You can do that . ; Right ? ; You know , you can put this button anywhere you want ,
Bed013_738	bk	So parsing done right is like chicken done right . ; Su ; So we could we could say this is what what 's sort of state of the art today . Nuh ? ; OK .
Bmr019_1681	s	But ; Tha - There are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh , these ca Not a lot , but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker ; and you can tell that when you run it . ; Or at least you can get clues to it .
Bmr014_1237	%--	I think we 're uh ; Done ? ; Kind of done . ; Actually , I was gonna
Bmr031_960	qw	Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately . ; OK . ; So what 's your question ? ; Question is , when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days
Bed008_859	qw	Mm - hmm . ; So this should sort of push it in one direction ; Right . ; however people also sometimes say how do I get there
Bns002_1552	s	You can I you can mail him later on the informa ; I don't know who he is . ; OK . ; Then , of course , the whole N S A group
Bmr020_1368	bk	There 's no adjusting of time boundaries . ; Well , eh , listening does take time too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro003_494	s	b May ; So , when you said that you were getting the labels for TIMIT , um , are y what do you mean by that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , I 'm just I 'm just , uh , transforming them from the , um , the standard TIMIT transcriptions into into a nice long huge P - file to do training .
Bed014_1014	s	So , you know , I mean . ; OK , so l forget about the b the camping thing . ; So let 's eh , any other problems w w w ? ; But , I suggested Monday .
Bmr025_469	b	I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? ; Maybe we should bleep that out . ; Yeah . ; Mmm , yeah .
Bro016_1153	s	By the way , ; um , ; there 's , uh , a couple people who are gonna be here ; I forget if I already told you this ,
Bro027_1608	b	So that delay , plus the LDA . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning , plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_467	s	Well , the the offices are actually a little ; the , ; think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix ; and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes ,
Btr002_1336	b	Mmm . ; But it was difficult finding them for some reason . ; Yeah ! ; Yep .
Bro018_325	b	Uh - huh . ; and also mmm I H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to to study ; well seriously the France Telecom proposal ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_1870	%--	Right . ; We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now . ; But ; Yeah , right , I mean .
Bmr009_1011	%--	So . You could say , you know " ten years on the east coast , five years on the west coast " or something or other . ; Well , We I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form . ; I think that 's alright if we want to follow up . ; But .
Bmr002_1033	bk	and if it doesn't look like that 's going to work , we 'll look at something else . ; I like that very much , ; and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with these larger corp corpus projects . ; OK .
Bro024_1554	b	And then I I have I used this as mean speech energy . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , it 's just a constant amount over all . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1222	qw	Yeah . ; Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . ; I just ; I who who 's the person in charge ?
Bmr015_806	%--	but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it . ; I mean that 'd that 'd be nice ; but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential . ; Um , I mean cuz I think the main thing is that , uh , you 're trying
Bsr001_1197	b	I I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way , you know , Mari probably won't be able to do a ton of collection . ; But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype collection devices or standards , then we could share data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr009_1386	ar	Oh , no . ; Oh no . ; I sort of thought they were part of the one of the Midlands . ; No , no . No .
Bro019_466	ba	So that that The baseline itself ; I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . ; I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . ; Wow .
Bro012_839	s	So if there 's an overall reason ; You know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing ; and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light ; uh and and in some , there was low light ,
Btr001_928	b	OK . ; OK . ; So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little apostrophe , or whatever you call it , ; Yeah .
Bro021_267	s	I mean , and maybe we could gain something by combining them ; Well , the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it . ; or ; Uh , I mean , first place it 's fifteen DB , uh , down across the utterance .
Bro022_686	%--	cuz I 'm still wondering where this improvement comes from . ; When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . ; But I wonder if it 's just because maybe Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than than TI - digit is , ; which is
Bro017_422	aa	Well , I mean , I 've known other friends who they they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married , ; Yeah . ; I know . ; I know , I know ,
Bed009_152	%	So at eleven ? ; Hmm . ; Thursday around eleven ? ; OK .
Bmr016_2064	bk	And i these can be changed , like I said . ; You know , I mean , as I said I was considering changing it to " digits " . ; And , it just i you know , it 's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is , and being sure the scripts know . ; Right .
Bmr008_949	aa	Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it . ; but ; OK . ; I agree .
Bro028_493	bk	Yeah . At these noise levels . ; Yeah . Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro003_1386	s	So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled , ; Yes . ; and and you 're saying about the Spanish ? ; The Spanish labels ?
Bro012_60	s	Yeah . ; I mean I think there 's some effect above twenty ; but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild . ; So , I mean it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild .
Bed014_440	bk	but after that Yeah , ; gung - ho . ; OK . Yeah , so so someti sometime next week . ; Great ,
Bmr019_849	s	I guess Sue had had some reactions . ; You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are . ; Yeah , that 's right . ; And so , we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like ,
Bmr009_330	%--	Plus , I think it has more elegant e ; Mm - hmm . ; The m the right model will be easier to see that way . ; So if I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech
Btr001_1357	bk	No . ; In neither case . ; And I 'm and I 'm thinking I 'm thinking you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got ; Yeah .
Bmr030_626	s	Oh , no , wait . ; I thought it was , like , a hundred megs . ; They 're the beep files . ; Yeah , it 's a p hundred meg .
Bro019_350	bk	Are y are you saying LDA ? ; Yeah . ; LDA . ; OK .
Bro028_1066	s	Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features . ; Um , ; so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this artificial question of of , uh , exactly how you how you a how you assess it ; and if if your order had been different in throwing them out .
Btr002_441	aa	Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Well , you know , there 's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation , ; Yeah .
Bed003_29	b	So , we were ; Ah ! ; Johno , where are you ? ; OK .
Bmr006_1613	%--	How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? ; How do you mean ? ; I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so " , ; They 're just gonna write " Bob " on it or do @ @
Bmr006_234	s	So . ; Oh , you age - ist ! ; What 's that ? ; Age - ist .
Bdb001_1330	b	so how do you merge it back in ? ; I understand what you 're saying . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1099	s	Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting . ; I think it 's a great idea . ; That could be fun . ; It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way
Bmr028_1423	s	I can understand it in context as you described it . ; But , it it seems to me that u um , it does import some negative evaluation , that , um , would maybe not be good if ; It has some shock value . ; It has shock value ,
Bns001_1050	no	Yeah ? ; OK , one of six . ; So . ; I don't have a mobile phone .
Bro024_362	s	And I think for this kind of discussion it matters . ; If it 's in the kiosk , then the physical situation is the same . ; It 's gonna you know , the exact interaction of the microphone 's gonna differ depending on the person and so forth . ; But at least the basic acoustics are gonna be the same .
Bed016_404	s	not a big deal . ; Yeah , you could steal anything you want , ; I don't care . ; Which you 've already done , obviously .
Bro014_1102	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right , right . ; whatever it
Btr001_2373	b	but it is . ; Maybe this is funny because it 's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way . " ; Mmm . ; Huh .
Buw001_1150	%--	OK . ; So so that was the prosody thing . ; We - I don't remember it . ; Um , we need to finish the
Bro019_394	ar	Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? ; Yeah . ; or is it ? ; No .
Bmr019_1160	s	W uh , w ; Chafe speaks about intonation units . ; Yes . Right . ; But maybe he speaks about spurts as well
Btr002_724	aa	it was just like " whoahh ! " ; Yeah . That 's really awful . ; You 've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening ? ; Yes . Absolutely .
Bro026_909	qw	So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . ; And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . ; And since they sort of work , uh , it means that they are already doing ; if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , " how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? "
Bro019_1158	b	because , suppose we we think that if the variance is high , maybe you have n uh , noise . ; Yeah . ; And if the variance is small , maybe you have uh , speech . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_1700	s	right ? ; For a long time people were hand - c coding linguistic rules ; and then they discovered machine - learning worked better . ; And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about , uh , the exact details of the algorithms .
Bed015_1596	bk	it c it it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure . ; Use the same Yep . ; So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . ; I see .
Bed013_1336	b	I mean this is perfectly legitimate , ; and I I would not have any problems with erasing this ; and say , that 's all we can activate , based on the utterance out of context . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr023_1087	s	Right ? ; We to ; Right . ; well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .
Bmr025_563	b	because um it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not ; because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off ; and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . ; Huh .
Bns001_357	s	Because they say " OK ; I 'm not willing to pay any back for this service , ; because I 'm just watching uh you know the sports news . ; So , if I switch If if , because of my motion , I 'm switching , or I 'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network , well , I I want the service to be uh stopped . "
Bdb001_205	bk	Meaning ? ; Uh , that 's a well , or something like it . ; It 's ICS uh , ICSI has a format for frame - level representation of features . ; OK .
Bed008_257	b	OK , so this was EVA . ; Maybe we can think of more things , ; cross ; Yeah .
Buw001_163	s	I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel ; And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z ; Let me , uh , turn that off . ; Oh . PZM nearest , nearest , next nearest .
Bed004_784	b	I mean , we have to ; " how do I get to X " . ; Then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different ; Right .
Bns002_497	g	So ; in fact , this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception , that will start in in a moment , is over . ; But then this node , um , this transmission is uh aborted . ; OK ?
Bmr026_1173	aa	I 'm not sure what this 'll mean . ; In the small training set ? ; Hello ? ; I I think so .
Bmr007_143	s	so . Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap , what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th the overlappee ? ; And there , it looks like you see some differences , ; um , that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they 're overlapped , ; but , of course , uh i e this is just one meeting , uh there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be required for a for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability .
Bro023_1486	b	channel ; Uh , no , ; these results with two stage Wiener filtering is ten frames ; Hmm .
Bed017_424	%--	So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . ; Now , ; um , ; basically giving this um Uh
Bns001_1761	s	eh s ; go on with considerations and potential ; and and uh ; um we didn't make s much progress today in the meeting ,
Bro019_627	bk	The new . ; I mean ; Yeah . ; OK .
Buw001_1743	bk	I should have sent I should have CC ' ed you as well . ; OK . ; Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . ; OK .
Bed016_905	b	It 's a speech - act . ; r ; Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that that i for example , if y ; Yeah .
Bmr025_74	b	and we get the transcript back ; and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , ; then uh we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , ; Excellent .
Bmr008_753	no	but if you have a bunch of , say , R - less dialects and uh you know , if they ; But even you know in Switchboard , I I remember looking really carefully at ; They have information sort of like TIMIT ; I don't know it 's how well they categorized ,
Bmr003_2588	%--	And then we could ; Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what 's based on these ; Mm - hmm . ; and it would cost
Bmr028_789	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah . That 's the point . ; the the ; Oh , OK .
Bed003_1546	b	and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist ; Um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around ; so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_281	b	Yeah , I that 's ; That I think was actually in the previous the Ubenth stuff . ; I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not , ; Mmm .
Bro003_1715	s	I think that would be a I think that 's a big big deal . ; Because the you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ? ; The That that really throws things off . ; You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector ,
Bns002_1142	%--	OK ? ; But probably this uh this is not something really useful . ; And that ca what can be u really useful is to reduce the global power consumption in the routing function . ; So ,
Btr001_2270	ba	Yeah . ; That 's a very nice characterization . ; Mm - hmm . ; Interesting .
Bed015_345	ba	you may be you may not be like everyone else in in Berkeley , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; but that 's OK .
Bmr005_1072	s	Uh so it 's it you have a a direct uh ; Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would ; um ; I 'm signing off .
Bmr024_509	b	and I 'd be interested to know the wha if you retrain ; Yep . ; um , ; Yeah .
Bmr016_2268	s	and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions . ; OK . ; But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing ; you 'd have to constantly re rerun that ,
Bed014_667	b	Right . ; Right . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_1811	2	OK . ; there was a category for @ @ speech . ; Yeah , ; the default .
Bro005_103	s	and testing on Italian . ; Mm - hmm . ; And training the net on French only ; and Spanish only
Bed015_1909	s	And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to , uh , do your set of ; but you have to do that anyway . ; For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm . ; So so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains ,
Bmr020_571	ba	And and we so we wrote this ; and then , we found we were at six pages , ; and then we started cutting furiously ; Oops .
Bmr018_447	b	but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll . ; Oh , OK . ; So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go " kur - chunk ! " ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_682	s	so we we 're gonna have to ; Yeah . ; but this is a good discussion , ; we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that
Btr002_1947	s	Oh my gosh . ; Oh man . ; Oh wow . ; You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something .
Bmr007_312	b	Mm - hmm . ; Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there . ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bro007_214	s	Yeah , it 's it 's significantly worse well but Mm - hmm . ; It 's significantly worse ; it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse . ; Exc - except for the HM
Bsr001_1698	fa	Why ? ; I have no idea . ; Because they 're a little different . ; Sorry .
Bsr001_967	b	They ; They will do , a bit . ; I am pretty sure they do . ; Yeah .
Bed009_547	s	Mm - hmm . ; um ; I think you 're gonna need ; We talked about this several times that that the the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .
Bns001_212	aa	Yeah . ; Everybody say yes ? ; Yeah ? ; Yes .
Buw001_626	s	Uh , y ; just to take pictures of who 's there , ; where the microphones are , ; and then we could also put in what 's on the board .
Bro013_702	cc	I guess it 's these are called " time frequency representations " ; and h he 's making the the time sh um finer grained and the frequency resolution um less fine grained . ; Mm - hmm . ; s so I 'm I guess my first stab actually in continuing his work is to um re - implement this this thing which um changes the time and frequency resolutions
Bmr028_726	s	Uh , just not during that time when it 's down . ; But that it should be down for an hour . ; So it just can't so we can't have two meetings in a row where the first meeting 's during that hour . ; That 's all I meant .
Bmr024_29	s	What what what are we collecting here ? ; Data ? ; So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll we 'll get to it and talk about it ? ; The SmartKom data ?
Bmr024_1089	d	Well we 're g we 're gonna automate that . ; OK . ; My intention is to do a script that 'll do everything . ; I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ?
Bmr018_1399	aa	Yeah , ; sure . ; So . It works . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_586	bk	It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S ; Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? ; Yep . ; Oh , oh oh .
Bro028_701	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So , um , my thought was maybe ; I mean , they 're not used as probabilities , ; but the log probabilities
Bmr030_867	bk	but it could be SB - one - hundred . ; And so if you query for f all machines that have that attribute , then you should see the names of the new machines . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr002_1197	qy	Uh - huh . ; So , w will the application the Meeting Recorder application , work ? ; Yeah . ; So , Is Part of the research is um " is fifty percent accuracy enough to do an useful information retrieval ? "
Bmr007_117	b	And couple times there are not . ; So , i it seems like it goes through bursts but , um that 's kind of it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_465	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; yeah , like that . ; OK .
Bmr022_345	bk	Oh , that 's an interesting idea . ; We could , but then that starts getting pretty long . ; No , no , no . But wait , maybe maybe what we have instead of a beep is a , uh , synthesized number . ; Yep .
Bed011_179	s	let 's go to our favorite endpoint one ; is again more or less we have um ; then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth . ; um I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it g of course goes where the sub - S
Bmr030_700	b	Yeah , that 's it . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I think that 's it . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_548	s	So that 's ; That 's right . ; Well that you know that was the concept of having the region thing , ; I It would be no problem to change it to options if um if that were desirable .
Bed003_1520	s	That 's a different issue . ; This is going to be an interesting transcript . ; Hmm ? ; I I want to see what it does with uh " landmark - iness " .
Bro024_89	%--	you take a point three percent hit , when the training and testing links are don't match or something ? ; Hello . ; Is that what it is ? ; Or ?
Bmr027_1013	s	Oh . I see . ; Yeah . ; or ? ; This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure .
Btr002_1919	s	Sure . ; Are we OK ? ; so . ; Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think .
Bed005_180	%--	It could be " this evening , which which films are on the cinema " , ; No i ; or " running in the cinema , ; which "
Bed009_477	s	it 's what I do anyway . ; Who How far is the uh the the M - three - L specification for for the la natural language input gone on the the uh ; I haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain . ; Yeah , it 's it 's not defined yet .
Bro028_619	ar	so there was some talk about having Mississippi State run the systems for them . ; And I ; Did did that come up at all ? ; Uh , no .
Bed017_645	b	We There 's someone in ICSI who actually has been working on has worked on that kinda stuff , ; and he 's worked with frame net , ; so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_1284	%--	Oh , oh , ; well , see in my pilot stuff , ; so in the half hour or so that I 'm doing . I 'd just as soon put it in , ; because I do think that you 'd find that those would be words
Bro004_843	qw	Mmm . ; Um , are we going to look at multi - band ? ; Are we gonna look at combinations of things ? ; Uh , what questions are we gonna ask ,
Bro013_729	ar	Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ? ; There are only zeros here . ; Well . ; No . " O " " O " " O "
Bro026_221	s	I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . ; In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . ; And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . ; And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise .
Bmr008_937	b	That 's hard though , for self - identification ; I ; You don't want to do it for political reasons , ; Hmm .
Bro018_1053	s	And the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer ; which sort of implies that the networks are bushier , ; you know , there 's more things it 's considering ; which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .
Bed014_1457	ba	Yeah , yeah , I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend , who 's like " Oh , well , I can bring over the DDR if you want . " ; Oh , oh , Dance Dance Revolution OK . ; He actually brought a clone called Stepping Selection , ; but it 's just as good .
Bro010_252	s	Um , ; but it was , ; uh , ; I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds .
Btr001_1624	b	Right . ; is kind of how I see it . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro005_877	s	so we asked people to listen to the um the sentence ; and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . ; But still , ; there there might be errors just in the in in the ph string of phonemes .
Bed009_946	b	yeah ; that 's getting it from the lexicon is just fine . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Sure ,
Bmr019_758	s	Right now the words like partial words are reject models ; Mm - hmm . ; and you normally allow those to match to any word . ; But then the background speech was also a reject model ,
Bro014_1292	s	And it and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something that shows some periodicity , uh , in frequency , ; Hmm . ; you know , ; and and and also in time .
Bro005_921	aa	Yeah . ; " Multi - multi - English " just means " TIMIT " , ; right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr002_1074	%--	Yes ! ; Yeah , there you go . ; Exactly . ; They 're actually , they seem to be more
Bro014_171	aa	Exactly . ; that had more . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Btr001_312	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; But , um , ; Right .
Bmr028_161	aa	and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly . ; It 'd be nice if we can do , like , a quick hack , ; just so we can play the audio file , too . ; Right .
Bmr022_121	%--	Yeah . ; I mean , it seems now , if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off . ; Well the only the only question about that that I have is , um , I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape . ; So I don't know whether
Bro004_1097	s	Um Cuz there 's " baseline Aurora " above it . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's This is mostly better than baseline , ; although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases .
Bro027_878	aa	And from the other side it 's forty - five . ; So , d i It 's forty - five . ; So it 's you have seventy - three features , ; Yeah .
Bmr020_149	b	Yeah . ; so . ; yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bro018_332	s	because maybe that we can have some ideas ; Mm - hmm . ; but not only to read the proposal . ; Look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and
Bmr015_232	s	I see . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while
Btr001_904	b	PRN . ; How it was really pronounced ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1096	b	Yeah , filtering . ; Yeah , it 's not exactly Wiener filtering ; but some variant of Wiener filtering . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_1355	b	Uh OK . ; Yeah . ; Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ? ; Yeah .
Bmr019_464	s	Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w ; I mean ; Oh , no , no . ; It 's tha that that we were saying , you know , well is how much worse is far than near , you know .
Bns003_143	bh	but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know . ; A restricted in . ; Not . ; Huh .
Bmr016_655	b	Insertions aren't bounded , ; so with a one - word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_401	s	Yeah ? ; So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's We know that that 's wrong in real time . ; Yeah ? ; But , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it ,
Btr001_1986	bk	there 's definitely a sense of persona . ; You definitely get an image of ; uh Especially if you can relate it to what the person or y what you assume the person is uh interested in academically . ; Yeah .
Bro022_680	cc	Yeah . ; Um . ; Yeah . ; And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone
Bmr008_419	s	I don't think it matters . ; People will put it , I I ; I I don't think it matters . ; If it makes you more comfortable , put Optional
Bmr018_1601	b	You 're you 're you can assume similar distributions , ; Yeah . ; but if you wanted to do disambiguation on a different type of , uh , test data then your training data , then that extra data wouldn't generalize , ; Right .
Bed008_685	co	we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that ; uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state , ; so that 's what you 'd have to do , ; you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact ,
Bmr014_197	b	And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , ; as long as we 're conscious about the batteries . ; That seems to be the key issue . ; Right .
Bro016_624	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's true . ; Right .
Bmr030_364	bk	Much faster than doing everything alone . ; Hand . ; From scratch . ; OK .
Bsr001_1732	s	so that the ; It 's something like tens of hours ; Mm - hmm . ; tens of hours of data , I think .
Bed011_588	s	so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think . ; You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something , ; Yeah . ; I w we will we will not ask you more .
Btr001_2014	s	Really hard . ; Yeah , ; and it 's hard ; and so we don't know what they 're referring to ,
Buw001_277	s	I mean , that gives you a summary ; but it doesn't really ; How do you generate queries from that ? ; Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system .
Bro014_1336	bk	We end up with ; over here ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr015_593	s	Start my new sentence . ; I I switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , uh , the uh , tighter time bins for partly for use in Thilo 's work ; and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project . ; And , um , I discovered in the process a couple of of interesting things ,
Bed006_173	s	the students in the undergrad class that he 's teaching ? ; Um well he said um we definitely " yes " , ; e ; however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else 's class at the moment
Bed005_12	bk	OK . ; So , we all switched on ? ; We are all switched on , yeah . ; Alright .
Bmr027_667	s	If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review . ; And , um So , ; if we make it a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much ; Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first ,
Bro028_586	s	Yes , for the training also . ; OK . ; And , um , they 're supposed to be coming out with it any time , ; the multi - CPU one .
Bed010_135	aa	For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . ; And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . ; That 's , you know , that 's that 's HPSG or whatever . ; Right .
Bro017_1272	bk	because if it 's the case , it 's maybe not so easy to use it on another architecture . ; uh e ev ; n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation ; Ah yeah .
Bmr027_287	bk	So . A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain period after we contact them that is implicitly giving their agreement . ; Yeah . ; Well , they 've already signed a form . ; Right .
Bns001_65	s	Thanks . ; Uh , OK . ; So , then let 's start with our weekly meeting . ; The last time 's uh we learned too much , I believe ,
Bro004_1245	%--	Probably don't want all zeros . ; Most recognizers don't like zeros ; Hmm . ; but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand
Bmr013_644	h	time so the meetings vary in length , ; what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? ; It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , ; so .
Bed005_882	s	and knights jumping out of windows , ; Mmm . ; and - and - and tons of stuff . ; So , th the database is huge ,
Bmr008_923	s	I mean , the more you ask , the more you realize that you 're not getting great answers to what you 're asking and ; Yeah . ; N Right . Yeah . ; Well , y you didn't really talk about the non - English speaker categories .
Bmr006_723	s	what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . ; Mmm . ; And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . ; And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise .
Bro003_798	s	probably so . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is i is absolutely pure French ,
Bmr002_1011	%--	Right . ; And uh see what it looks like . ; Good . ; You - you can access it through um through the , uh , whatever
Bro025_610	bk	Oh . ; So we have a VAD which is like neur that 's a neural net . ; Oh , yeah . Hmm . ; Oh , you 're talking about the VAD net .
Bro004_493	bk	OK , I see . ; So , seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent . ; So . ; OK , OK , gotcha .
Bro021_910	aa	Well , y we can expre we can put this expression ; X times one plus , uh , N uh , N N N minus X ? ; The ; Yeah .
Bro027_1823	bk	It it seems that the VAD network doesn't Well , it doesn't drop , uh , too many frames ; because the dele the number of deletion is reasonable . ; But it 's just when we add the tandem , the final MLP , and then ; Yeah .
Bmr030_219	%--	Mm - hmm . ; uh ; help , my brain ; with the uh ,
Bro023_1154	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I know . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro010_202	s	so they were basically ; I mean , ; they were more or less trading computation for performance ; and we were , uh , trading latency for performance .
Bmr025_12	s	OK . ; Should we just go in order ? ; Transcription status ? ; Who 's that 's probably you .
Bmr006_1557	aa	Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . ; And someone who looked ; You can go , you know , uh , " Z " uh , for instance . ; Yeah , exactly .
Bro027_2020	%--	So that 's you won't be at the next three of these meetings . ; Is that right ? ; Uh , I won't ; it 's probably four because of
Bmr026_1031	s	Mm - hmm . ; He knows . ; Right . ; And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up .
Bmr011_227	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah , I 'm not surprised . ; I mean , " Baaah ! " ; Yeah , but I mean it 's not just that , it 's also you know you
Bmr023_897	%--	when I u ; We had some problems before with offsets . ; This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal . ; So we we had , uh
Bmr020_177	bk	or just overall volume ? ; Yeah . ; But re well regardless . I think it 's he 's he 's in all of them , ; Oh . OK .
Bed016_762	s	could we capture that ; with a different construal of ; Yeah , it 's a little it 's , ; uh we 've thought about it before , uh t uh to use the examples in other papers ,
Bed014_1143	s	Only have to change one vowel . ; That 's great . ; Yeah . Just ; All the old like graphs ,
Bmr018_183	h	I 'll I 'll I 'll , um , get make that available . ; OK , and has it been corrected ? ; Oh , well , wait . ; Um
Bmr016_1446	s	Article . ; " UH " . ; Oh . ; or the " UH " , " EH " , " AH " were all the same .
Bed008_244	bk	Well , that 's ; Mode of transportation ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr025_720	s	so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written . ; OK . ; And then you can download it ; and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things .
Bmr014_871	s	one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , ; but overall people are talking about technical topics . ; Nobody 's gonna get hurt . ; Nobody 's being l libeled .
Bed011_686	aa	uh , I have found three , ; " drive there " , " walk there " uh or " be driven " , which means bus , taxi , BART . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1275	aa	Um ; Well that that says that , you know , the , um the models in in , uh , the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_212	bk	Let 's see , so it would be two to the thirty for every output node ? ; Which is very th very large . ; Oh ! That 's n ; Oh .
Bmr005_846	s	I mean cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly . ; Yeah , ; and I haven't tried using that . ; It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that .
Bed016_312	s	and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here ; and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . ; And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides ; but he didn't do it ,
Bmr025_161	s	So what does the user see as the result of the query ? ; On which tool ? ; THISL . ; The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK
Bed004_903	s	and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls , ; so ; Right . ; Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge .
Bmr003_1994	ba	send me pointers , rather , ; and I 'll put it together . ; I 'm not o ; Wonderful .
Btr001_1037	qrr	and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant . ; Are did they mean " uh " like they 're pausing ; Mmm , yeah . ; or did they mean " a " like " a person " ?
Bro011_364	s	I see . ; And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . ; So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use ; and do you combine them using the soft " AND - OR " or you do something , you know , more complicated
Bed011_1141	s	Uh - huh , ; I 'll be gone . ; Yeah . ; He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town .
Bmr009_622	%--	And it 's interesting , I think , to consider the the window of normalization , ; normalization window . ; Eh because eh if we have a type of , a kind of eh overlap , eh backchannel overlap , with a short duration , is possible eh to normali ; i i that if we normalize eh with eh eh consider only the the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh side on the right side overlapping with a a very eh oh a small window
Bmr014_808	s	Yeah . ; I think everyone in the meeting can access the web . ; No , I think we have to be able to print it out . ; It 's not just if they want to print it out .
Bro013_311	aa	But ; we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? ; Because because we have ano an extra month or something . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1328	s	Yeah , we 're gonna get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server , actually . ; Yes . ; Hmm . Mm - hmm . ; That 'll be It 's a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh SUN
Bed013_588	bk	Uh - huh , uh - huh . ; They just want ASCII . ; Pure ASCII lines , ; OK .
Bro024_1799	s	Well , I only say that the this is , a summary of the of all the VTS experiments ; and say that the result in the last um , for Italian the last experiment for Italian , are bad . ; I make a mistake when I write . ; Up at D I copy one of the bad result .
Bro019_1325	b	Some is some harmonics ; I don't know , ; I can I can pull that paper out from ICASSP . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1352	qy	I just don't see why you would ; I mean does th ; Who uses this uh this data structure ? ; You know ? Like , do you say " alright I 'm going to uh do an SPG action " .
Bed014_1078	s	I might I might um , ; You - y ; s You said you 're busy over th until the weekend , right ? ; Yeah , sort of through the weekend
Bmr021_766	s	Um . ; For the C - zero . ; Right . But in what we 've done so far , because we didn't have any special provision for C - zero , we just treat it as as any of the other features , ; we 've done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side .
Btr001_1324	s	Yes ! ; Yeah , and we had to split them up . ; See , I never got one of those . ; Yeah , and you have to parse them all down .
Bro021_656	bd	So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges . ; Oh . ; So you have to do some scaling . ; But that 's not a big deal
Bed006_419	s	and this is the place ; and it 's a museum ; and you want to do some ; and and and there 's a person looking at pictures .
Bmr012_161	t3	Anything else ? ; I guess what time do we have to leave ? ; Three thirty ? ; Yeah .
Bmr010_595	s	a friend , ; and , ; Yeah ! ; uh , they and and , you know , the the organization always did wanna help us .
Bmr018_921	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz then then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time . ; that you 're not gonna miss something ,
Bro025_261	s	Just using either their VAD or our current VAD . ; Our way . ; Oh , OK . ; So , our current VAD is is more than twenty percent ,
Bmr007_1342	s	It 's uh so , it was just a comment on the software , not a comment on prescriptions on how you wear microphones . ; OK . ; OK , that 's let 's let 's let 's do digits . ; Get the bolts , " whh whh "
Bro027_1104	aa	Much less than that , it was worse , ; Yeah . ; and ; Yeah .
Bro003_1917	bk	Well . ; I see . ; So . ; Right .
Bro022_899	s	So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they they are they are lost . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where our VAD was not very good .
Bmr012_445	b	And actually we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models ; That 's amazing . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2543	b	But the projector , ; not the air conditioner . ; yeah . ; Huh .
Bed016_135	fa	But , with a focus on ; Can I s ; I think I need a copy of this , yes . ; Sorry .
Bed005_793	%--	But the whole i is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with , sort of , questions ? ; Uh , you know ; Oh , yeah ? ; Well , I mean
Bed010_842	s	Uh , so there are gonna be some some some things like that , which are not science but system . ; But we aren't gonna ignore those ; cuz we 're we 're not only going The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . ; And how much we build , and and so forth .
Bed005_641	%--	So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this , ; and the uh , description ; With sugge yeah , suggested improvements ; and
Bro010_325	aap	well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , uh , uh , multi - frame , uh , uh , KLT . ; Wasn't there ; Was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? ; They weren't looking ahead much .
Bmr006_1436	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Ah ! ; So it 's it would be neat .
Bro022_256	s	Hmm ! ; something like that ? ; Mm - hmm . ; But it 's you know , it 's this room .
Bmr029_635	ba	I mean , th not the bottom one , ; but the middle one ; Mm - hmm . ; would be really easy once you 've got the top one going .
Bro018_7	b	Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week . ; Yeah . ; Well eh you know that I work I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1765	s	but uh I I think the the position in the file eh doesn't work eh eh in long file , ; a very long file . ; Well , what he 's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue , for F - seek . ; Right , if you 're sending at an integer instead of a long .
Bns001_972	s	And if this is the case well , thus seamless integration could be we strongly affected . ; At least , uh , if you we want to use U M ; I 'm I 'm just uh throwing the question . ; uh I mean , looking for an answer
Bro027_1621	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , ; um . ; So there are there was , like , some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when I try different thresholds .
Bmr009_625	aa	i i that if we normalize eh with eh eh consider only the the eh window eh by the left eh ri eh side on the right side overlapping with a a very eh oh a small window ; eh the if the fit of normalization is eh mmm bigger eh in that overlapping zone eh very short ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , that 's true .
Bed015_1293	b	But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them . ; OK . ; Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , " source , path , goal " has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_569	s	and that is you you get X , which is whatever , ; the castle . ; The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , ; that they have admission fees ,
Bmr024_107	b	Well , maybe uh , since that that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . ; Someone can fill in Liz and Andreas later . ; OK . ; Uh
Bmr011_1102	co	after they ; Yeah , but ; I I think that they are , ; We 'll have to talk to Brian .
Bmr019_195	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Cuz our sense from the other from the Aurora , uh , task is that ; And try it with TI - digits ?
Bmr011_687	s	Right . Internally , ; but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . ; So it 's just ; Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video .
Bmr014_373	bk	Yeah , absolutely . ; Yeah , yeah . ; I mean , the digits don't take up that much time . ; OK .
Bro004_284	s	actually ? ; Yeah . ; Um . The English data No , the multilingual databases are two times the broad English data . ; We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge .
Bmr008_1027	qw	uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple , ; it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language . ; Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , Mike number , Channel , Mike type . ; Why do we need that much information ,
Bro023_1437	bk	So ; But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency . ; And the last frame doesn't have any latency . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_981	s	H ; What does he do to choose those ? ; The method he uses is kind of funny ; is , um , he starts with he has a set of M of them .
Bro027_973	s	uh , ; For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you know what the straight features do .
Bsr001_1322	s	it uh there are very ; " Computer , show me a web page on X , " return . ; Yeah . ; It is exactly these things that I mentioned .
Bmr012_119	b	Birth year ? ; A actually , wait a minute , ; Although on ; Yeah .
Bro005_888	s	but , well , this is not clear yet ; because all our nets are trained on the same noises ; and ; I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth .
Bed009_433	%--	So , if it 's only like in in the in the film and T V thing , ; OK , you can do this . ; And you just get information and give it to people . ; But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on
Btr002_1915	aap	Mm - mmm . ; I 'm fine . ; I can stay . ; I don't have to be anywhere until five ,
Bmr002_1206	ba	Well , but you know we have to try . ; Yeah . ; We we we could simply not do the project . ; But I think that 's a bad solution .
Bro019_636	bk	w Uh , it doesn't seem to hurt on TI - digits , finally . ; OK . ; Maybe because of other changes . ; OK .
Bns002_694	s	OK ? ; But , again , we can assume that eh if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen . ; OK ? ; So the point we ha what we have done is to present a mechanism would pr which provides uh one uh value for a given uh mmm probability .
Bmr007_1189	%--	OK , and you can say ; OK . ; But you don't want to just totally excise it ; because
Bmr003_1935	%	It 's mine ! ; All mine ! ; Well then you have to do the web site . ; But
Bmr027_451	s	you know , that when they serve , like ; uh , uh , uh uh , ; you know , like dead - beat dads , ; they they they make it look like they won something in the lottery
Bmr022_984	bd	Oh , right . So they could use the ; I wonder if you could do an adaptor . ; I don't know if you can or not . ; Anyway , it 's just an idea .
Bro004_968	aa	Yeah . ; And you have the original features . ; Which are PLP , or something . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_780	%--	I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model , ; so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences . ; You know , there are so many things about this that are non - uniform that I think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing , ; but you 're just not going to I mean we 've
Bro004_1318	%	you know ? ; Mmm , no . ; You were using Gin perhaps , ; yeah ?
Bro014_1374	s	This is the signal . ; I see that . ; Oh , yeah . ; The frame .
Bro005_1292	%--	Mmm . ; and now there isn't any difference , ; Yeah . ; because the other
Bro024_662	s	Start with a different what ? ; Different prototype , ; which is like a different initialization for the , uh , s transition probabilities . ; It 's just that right now , the initialization is to stay more in the current state ,
Bed013_560	ba	Four pages ? ; I mean it 's it 's not even a h ; Yeah . ; OK , so it 's a little thing .
Bmr022_219	bk	and then ; That 's what I was saying . Is that that you could have each speaker could have their own tone . ; Oh was it ? ; Oh .
Bmr019_468	b	Oh , th OK . ; And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at , ; That factor of two . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_493	ba	Nice meetings , by the way . ; Yeah . ; I mean , they they were people who didn't have accounts at ICSI , ; so they 're they 're harder to find .
Bro005_1379	ba	OK . ; Silent partner in the in the meeting . ; Oh , we got a laugh out of him , ; that 's good .
Bro024_1912	s	No ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So I mean , if if if I would put it put on the head of a project mana manager I I I I would say , uh , um I mean there is not so much time left now .
Bns001_73	co	I believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time ; Hi . ; and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime . ; So , but , anyway , I would like that Miguel Sanchez will introduce himself a little bit , concerning his background , what he intend to do .
Bns001_523	s	Barwan . ; How 's it start ? ; I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz . ; Uh da it was another related project called Daedalus .
Bmr013_135	b	Well the prosodics are so much different ; s it 's gonna be , strange . ; I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example . ; Yeah .
Bro027_1845	b	No . ; the VAD has a ; Ah . ; Yeah .
Bro014_830	%--	So the ; So basically the spectrum of the excitation for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh ; OK . ; Yeah , w
Bmr011_1585	bk	The second worst was British English . ; That 's funny . ; So h it 's , you know , t ; Alright .
Bmr010_80	s	Um , and , um , the other thing , uh , ; which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit , ; which is that , um , ; uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain
Bro003_1446	g	Oh , yeah , yeah , ; sure . ; No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops , ; right ?
Bmr022_1174	bk	Yep . ; and don't let anyone check it out ; No , it does not the CVS doesn't work that way . ; Oh ,
Bmr003_2231	s	Yeah , I mean , we I had that last time . ; But uh there are actually that you know , there 's an extra there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So there are actually six XLR outs on the back of the radio receiver
Bed006_1633	b	Don't worry . ; Yeah . ; And we 'll get the summary ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1039	fa	A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change ; OK . ; and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . ; I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said .
Bdb001_1333	b	Mm - hmm . ; And I I guess the answer is , um , it 's gonna be different every time . ; It 's j it 's just gonna be ; Yeah .
Btr002_922	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; it 's that mountain right there , I can tell , then ; Yeah .
Bro012_1354	b	Uh . Has not . ; has not , ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_369	s	Oh . ; which was just generic contact information . ; Well Most ; But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local ,
Bro014_551	b	if we can cut down on that maybe we can make some progress . ; M ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr029_869	bk	Yeah . Have just a little bit . ; Yeah . I don't think it 'll make a matter . ; Yeah . I think there was only a few ; OK .
Bmr024_1093	s	No . ; Or s ? ; s ? Oh , OK . ; It 's all tape robot ,
Bmr012_1093	s	OK ; and who is the contact if I wanna do an invoice ; Yeah . ; cuz I think that 's how we did it before .
Bmr016_938	b	But for for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on ; Oh yeah . ; No . We always have the original long ones . ; Yep .
Btr001_275	s	yeah . ; We w we probably shouldn't , right ? ; Is that ; I it 's a good question .
Bed013_1418	b	Huh . ; So I 'm gonna do the wizarding ; and Thilo 's gonna do the instructing . ; Mmm .
Bro022_432	b	I didn't . ; No . ; Oh . ; Hmm .
Bns002_759	%--	Yeah , ; well , you just take the ; The frame could also be uh whatever , I don't know but a few hundred bytes , you know , that takes a little bit time . ; Let 's let 's
Bsr001_1837	%--	yeah . ; Ah ! ; OK . ; and they don't
Buw001_1096	b	I don't know . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , there 's a ; Yeah .
Bro004_235	ar	you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three . ; Ye ; That 's what you were just saying , I think . ; Uh , more actually .
Bed011_1075	aa	Yeah . ; And so , exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things . ; Mm - hmm . ; Sure .
Bed013_1362	br	You know ? ; I mean , ; Here 's hoping . ; Hmm ?
Bed014_346	%--	you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those ; and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th ; hopefully turns out to be consistent , ; so that the
Bmr015_300	s	And so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal . ; And I 'm I I hope to be doing very little of it . ; And ; uh , which was also true for the pre - proposal ,
Bro010_824	s	for every if , ; um ; The higher level there 's a soft OR gate . ; Uh , so if if this detector detects um , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect uh , the OR gate at the top says , " OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . "
Bed008_1226	s	Yeah , I I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . ; Right . ; Yeah , and Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , ; but um we have to know what we want first .
Bmr011_1011	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; so . ; Hmm .
Bmr030_716	s	You can click on that ; and it 'll query Abbott , ; and give you a a list of all the disks that we have ; and then , uh , what 's on each one ,
Bro003_654	%--	um , ; but ; He 's tethered . ; s
Bmr002_719	s	although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between . ; Right . ; Yeah , presumably . ; When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM ,
Bmr007_233	s	But just no overlaps . ; OK , so if the this ; It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus ; Yes , exactly and that 's that 's where Jose 's pro project comes in .
Bmr030_615	aa	Huh ! ; Well , they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they 're transcribing , anyway . ; That 's interesting . ; Yeah .
Bed013_551	b	never hurts to try . ; And um , ; maybe even That 's maybe the time to introduce the the new formalism that you guys have cooked up . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_480	b	so . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Hmm .
Bed014_1306	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK , which was that o one of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called " Towards a formal cognitive semantics " ; which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all . ; Yeah .
Bmr030_263	s	Yeah . ; This is a nice smooth one ; Oh , neat . ; and it really does a good job .
Bmr002_1343	cc	We 're gonna ; I mean , How many How many How many meetings ? ; I 'm gonna go download " Transcriber " ; and Jane and I will look at it
Bmr007_1263	bk	OK . ; I have one concept a t I I want to say , which is that I think it 's nice that you 're preserving the time relations , ; s so you 're you 're not just cutting you 're not doing scissor snips . ; Right .
Bed011_818	s	And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people . ; Yeah . ; And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say " How much cheese do you want ? " ; and they say " Ah , enough . "
Bdb001_131	ba	the utterance that it 's referring to could be U - seventeen or something like that . ; OK . ; So , ; I mean , that seems that seems g great for all of the encoding of things with time
Bed015_1787	s	Yeah . ; the hedges paper ? ; Yeah . ; I read some of that paper actually .
Bmr011_1125	b	Good . ; Right , cuz ; Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to uh , uh , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . ; y yeah .
Bro026_249	2	Yeah , ; OK . ; And then the mel and then the log , and then the ; Then the LDA filter ,
Bed015_497	aa	Hmm , ; well this this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your C dot something ; N ; Yeah .
Btr002_2598	s	It was just that one spot . ; I 've seen " ho " 's ; It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know . ; " Ho - ho - ho " ?
Bmr028_675	s	To you . ; Right ? ; In order to do that ? ; Yeah . He he didn't say he hasn't said anything to me about it .
Bmr007_1325	s	Appreciate that . ; I think what I what this has , uh , caused me so this discussion caused me to wanna subdivide these further . ; I 'm gonna take a look at the , uh backchannels , ; how much we have anal I hope to have that for next time .
Btr002_880	s	OK . OK . ; I 'll move it move the line back . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I usually just use the mouse .
Bmr024_262	b	Yeah . ; And they 're really excellent . ; Well , that 's good . ; Yeah .
Bed014_658	b	Anyway . ; So one could well imagine , ; but not yet . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_243	%--	OK . ; Right ? ; As of what point ? ; I mean .
Bro018_569	h	Yeah . ; Does there some kind of a distance metric that they use ; or how do they for cla what do they do for classification ? ; Um .
Bsr001_526	b	I think you just get used to it after five minutes . ; So I I guess ; you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1258	qw	Yeah . ; OK . ; Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too . ; Yeah , what happened to that ,
Bro018_95	b	or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure ; and ; like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing counts . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bns001_116	s	I 've been teaching computer networks . ; And , well , I am more or less uh , knowledgable about , well , TCP IP networking , ISO uh , networking , ; and , uh ; well I 'm I 'm a computer guy ,
Bmr024_1616	s	A unison digits ? ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms .
Bed002_174	s	OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . ; It should be on already . ; Um . ; Either one of those .
Bmr014_352	s	Yeah . ; Well , so um , should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ? ; Well , we have about thirty - two hours ; uh as of , I guess a week and a half ago ,
Bmr005_861	b	we 're I mean , I don't expect Jose to to do it for uh f fifty hours of of speech , ; but I mean we if uh if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it . ; Yeah . Sure . ; Sure .
Bmr019_1728	b	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; because I I enjoyed @ @ very much , ; Mmm .
Bmr028_331	ba	Beep . ; Beep , ; y right . ; Yeah . Yeah . I like it .
Bro027_485	%--	You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? ; With two an two hundred and seventy . ; Two - seventy . ; If
Bmr016_385	s	but um ; Overlapping digits ! ; The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load . ; Alright everybody 's laughing .
Bmr009_1270	qo	That 's what the " Other " is for . ; No , I mean what if we put in both ways of asking them ? ; So . One is Region ; and the another one is " if you had to characterize yourself your accent , what would you say ? "
Bro027_966	s	Again . ; Mm - hmm . ; But , ; I The other thing is , I mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different ,
Bed009_626	s	hmm ; whether we 're we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not . ; No . ; No , that 's gonna be phased out .
Bro018_419	s	He 's I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So he 's he 's going to ICASSP which is good .
Bns001_1252	%--	And you see that there 's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks . ; But the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network . ; You have to have in mind always the end to end scope . ; And if you see , for instance We have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things , u
Bed004_153	qh	Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order . ; And uh she did not . ; She ; Really ?
Bed002_1364	bk	OK . ; I first thought it had something to do with the material ; that it w that 's why I asked . ; That 's right , OK .
Bed003_1389	s	So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , ; Hmm . ; the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen ; so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing
Bmr028_1527	b	Hmm . ; Huh ! ; And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , " Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . " ; Hmm .
Bns001_1391	s	four different providers on it . ; Maybe I 'm wrong ; but ; if I have the funding I say " OK , well , I can buy this or even I can buy a mobile computer ,
Bmr007_958	fa	" Mixed " . ; " Mixed ? " ; Mm - hmm . ; Sorry .
Bed014_139	s	OK , got it . ; And um therefore the , ; uh ; if it 's OK that we give her a couple of more hours per week , then she 'll do that .
Bro003_1866	%--	Oh , I see . ; So the SAMPA 's just mapping those . ; Got it . ; What , uh
Bmr010_779	b	Yeah . ; So so , like , yours is pretty far down below your mouth . Yeah . ; But ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_969	s	Yeah . ; And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says " and " versus " nnn " versus , you know , " nd " , whatever ; Mm - hmm . ; all the different ways of reducing " and " .
Bed005_1360	bk	Yes , u a w a lot of people are aware of that . ; I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ? ; Um ; OK .
Bed008_1073	b	So uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation ; And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said ; what 's the utterance go giving us ; Yeah .
Bed015_538	s	Does it , you know does it refer to , um ; if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say " Watergate " you 're referring to " a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France " . ; But in a different context , " oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know , Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US ; and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all " .
Bmr007_266	%--	Mm - hmm . ; With eh that fricative sounds , but uh I have new information but I have to to study . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but I I 'd u
Btr002_2292	aa	So . ; Hmm . ; Which is a very it 's that 's how I tended before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription , how I tended to look all conversations , ; That 's right .
Bro004_1128	g	You find stretches where the combination of the frame wise VAD and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . ; And then it 's going through and just throwing the data away . ; Hmm . ; Right ?
Bmr022_1209	s	and didn't get mentioned in the " key " file , ; but they were only there for a second , ; but it 's t useful to mention that they were there . ; So I th I think that the " key " file is usefu for notations related to the meeting ,
Bro024_954	s	not from the mel filter banks . ; So ; Hmm . ; Maybe it 's just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector
Bro012_918	%--	right ? ; Yeah , but it 's not clear , ; yeah . ; So uh
Bro024_101	bk	but the case , uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test , um , comparing train on twelve seconds versus train on six seconds . ; And which was worse ? ; The train on twelve seconds . ; OK .
Btr002_1854	s	And there was all this meta stuff about ; that was fun . ; Cuz I was giving a report on what the comments were , ; and it was one of these was this ,
Bns002_1157	%--	That 's O K . ; Yeah , yeah . ; So , these are more or less uh some open problems , ; and uh well just a quick comment about probably
Bed016_725	g	and th w I mean it 's he there 's a platform notion , ; Yeah , I I believe all that , ; it 's just ; right ?
Bro024_1032	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , so it 's possible to get very short latency . ; But , again , we 're the the approaches that we 're using are ones that take advantage of ; Yeah .
Bmr026_19	b	She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings . ; Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something . ; Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers ; Mmm .
Bmr005_696	qy	Yeah . ; but only mark speaker ; Uh - huh . ; Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?
Bmr024_604	b	Um ; Nnn . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1228	s	That 's wonderful . ; Well ; And and we ; I mean , i I never thought about it before ,
Bmr024_1016	ar	Right . ; So , what if we buy , uh uh , what what do they call these , um high density ? ; Well , why don't you have this have a this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ? ; No , no .
Bed010_97	s	OK . ; OK . ; Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , ; you know . And then all that good stuff .
Bro022_265	s	I was using the word " reverberation " in two ways . ; He 's also putting in , uh , a ; he 's taking out some reverberation , ; but he 's putting in something ,
Bmr016_2205	%--	but ; Great . ; have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel ; Uh , for for a total of like twenty m
Btr001_2667	aap	Mm - hmm . ; but ; And I thought that there must be an indication here . ; Used to be .
Bed015_2158	s	But , uh , ; Yes . ; This is that 's that would be a good thing to try . ; It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story
Bed015_266	ba	Right . ; So that 's a useful thing ; so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . ; OK , so that all looks good .
Bmr012_1277	b	Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say . ; Yeah . ; Be great . ; OK .
Bed006_725	aap	This is the uh what the action planner uses ? ; Right ? ; This is ; Right . Currently .
Bmr008_1694	b	Ninety percent of them are over two m two hundred milliseconds . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_453	%--	and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . ; Mm - hmm . ; But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , ; because , you know I mean , jus
Buw001_729	aa	I agree . ; And if it 's simple as I mean , as simple as just the digital ; Otherwise you 'd you lose it . ; Yeah .
Bed012_644	%--	Those are The bottom things are inputs , also . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah . ; OK , that was
Bmr011_977	s	and she said , " I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , " ; " but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just " ; Cuz you know , if you don't know ; Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that .
Bmr010_394	s	Mm - hmm . ; I think that 's a good point . ; Hmm . ; That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient .
Btr002_471	s	But th it 's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they 're set on ? ; Right . ; OK . ; And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely ,
Bro019_421	b	and that itself gives like twenty - two percent ; because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . ; And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , I just , uh , use ; Hmm .
Bro028_793	aa	So if he 'll ; he might work on improving the noise estimate ; or on some histogram things , ; Yeah .
Bmr012_436	aa	Oh one thing I guess I didn't get ; so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard ; the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or ; Yeah .
Bed015_1742	s	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , but about linguistic hedges , ; I mean , those those tend to be , um , funky anyways
Bro005_261	%--	at the first and the ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , PLP
Bro003_1390	s	That was in different format , ; Oh , I see . ; that the format for the em the program to train the neural network . ; I necessary to convert .
Bro004_1015	s	Um , let me pass this out , by the way . ; Um These are ; Did did did I interrupt you ? ; Yeah , I have one .
Bed016_181	s	so . Um , ; OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever . ; And ; I 'm making changes .
Bmr003_2515	%	Yeah , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I think and uh , having having it on wireless is is the neatest way neatest way to do it . ; R
Bro004_529	s	I I think that was all it was . ; You had some very limited results that at that point ; Yeah . ; which showed having in these these other languages .
Bmr018_319	aa	That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part . ; and that 's what I 'm not sure about . ; Yeah , ; I am too .
Bmr007_582	s	Um , I could imagine that as there 's a fair number of um cases where , and this is sort of , not really hostile , but sort of competitive , where one person is finishing something and you have , like , two or three people jumping trying to trying to trying to , uh grab the next turn . ; Trying to get the floor . ; Yeah . ; And so it 's not against the person who talks first because actually we 're all waiting for that person to finish .
Bmr014_593	b	I 'm I 'm working on it . ; So , I hope ; Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ? ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1460	aa	and then you have time spent in English speaking country . ; Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying " which one parenthesis S paren closed parenthesis " . ; Cuz if they spent time in in Britain and America ; Yes .
Bns002_1231	s	and and you know it will work with the other brand . ; Yeah . ; And one additional question from myself , ; but maybe also short ,
Bmr006_239	s	Right , Yeah . ; Yeah . ; We 'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them . ; " Age - ist " .
Bmr016_2229	bk	so I it 's gonna be a more reliable thing ; No I know I know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better . ; and I 'm not sure ; Yeah .
Bdb001_882	b	Well , that was a different point . ; Right ? ; So what I was saying is that ; Right .
Bed003_194	%--	But ; Yeah . ; Tourist - y landmarks also happen to be ; Wouldn't couldn't they also be
Bns002_1516	s	uh they are very interested in that . ; They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom ; but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff . ; And University of Uppsala , Sweden ,
Bed014_1368	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . Great . And then we 're gon we 're gonna ; because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff ? ; So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that .
Bro013_357	d	It 's um from OGI . ; So it 's the network trained it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units , ; and um nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs . ; This is the one they had originally ?
Bro017_66	s	so everybody is going to copy what we did . " ; Yeah ; well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . ; We never uh uh denied that .
Btr002_3132	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; If it 's " mmm " , I can tell it 's ; Yeah .
Bro012_465	ba	Right . ; So it 's around , like , point five . ; No , point six uh percent absolute on Italian ; Worse .
Bro024_1673	b	For low gains um , I use the smoothed sm uh , smoothed version ; Uh . ; but for high gain @ @ it 's I don't smooth . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_838	b	It 's a sig it 's a sigmoid , ; Yeah . ; uh , with weighted sum at the input , ; Hmm .
Bro026_439	s	Mm - hmm . ; So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way . ; And then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . ; Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot .
Bro004_1173	%--	So I think they 're they 're doing something like that . ; I think that they 're they 're ; I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . ; In other words , it 's uh
Bed005_938	s	That 's great ! ; Right . ; Not precisely what we want , ; and that 's that 's wh where it it gets difficult .
Bmr014_173	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them . ; Yeah .
Bro028_944	s	And he 's done some work using an auditory model of , um , human hearing , ; and using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features . ; And he did work back in Germany with , um , a toy recognition system using , um , isolated digit recognition as the task . ; It was actually just a single - layer neural network that classified words
Bmr027_579	b	You know , they 're all more or less here ; or it 's it 's Eric and Dan and so on . ; But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_378	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , sometimes they p they usually put them in prethen parentheses , ; and you think to yourself , " You were way off , ; Yeah .
Bro027_1928	s	Well , we don't know what 's it 's gonna be the TI - digits yet . ; He hasn't got the results back yet . ; Yeah . ; If you extrapolate the SpeechDat - Car well - matched and medium - mismatch , it 's around , yeah , maybe five .
Bns002_747	%--	so every single transmission in every single transmission we are checking with the receiver the power level we have to use for the data transmission . ; That 's the main thing . ; And as , uh ; And how do you
Bmr007_713	b	Ee - you mean , transc no ; Well , you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the the seat number . ; And that could be ; Yeah Yeah .
Bed006_178	%--	and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all . ; OK , but th I guess it 's that um people in his class cover a different set ; so ; than the c
Bmr016_144	s	No , no , I guess what I 'm saying is that ; Just let them read it how they read it . ; to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it ; and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .
Bmr019_196	b	Yeah . ; Cuz our sense from the other from the Aurora , uh , task is that ; And try it with TI - digits ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1443	qh	Um ; But then , to go , for instance , to UMTS , and figure out what is available within UMTS . ; And if I really have an IP application , where I need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of QS will be available in the rest of the internet . ; So how can I map these things uh to the UMTS stuff ?
Bro024_1187	s	e ; like the fact that the the models tend to align their first state on silence and their last state o on silence also . ; So the reference reference alignment would label as speech some silence frame before speech and after speech . ; This is something that we already noticed before
Bro017_190	s	You haven't tried that yet ? ; not not not much . ; Hmm . ; Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad - hoc techniques
Bed015_2112	s	but also filtered . ; Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse ; Mm - hmm . ; plus the situation and the user model .
Btr002_2735	s	when there 's really long spaces , it segments random spaces in between . ; And th you know , they get that ; and there 's nothing there , ; so they m s mark it as a breath when it 's really actually nothing .
Bed002_1059	s	OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be , ; and we have some some data that 's loose , ; we can use our own intuition , ; and see how hard it is ,
Bro024_945	s	Yeah , but again , that 's just log energy as opposed to filter bank energy . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; So it 's not the mel .
Bed010_722	s	You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . ; So the s typical task is subdivision . ; So there 's a a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , " Where 's the midpoint ? " ; And they do fine .
Bmr019_687	aa	and there 's no real difference in ; No gain . ; Actually it was better with slightly better or about th ; Right .
Bmr011_1694	s	The fa ; " Please throw everything in that direction . " ; Yeah . Anyway . ; Padded cell .
Bro003_314	s	That 's ; Mmm . ; Oh yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra .
Bmr009_1199	s	Yeah , exactly . ; It 's identity thing . ; And they 're glad to tell you . ; style .
Btr002_924	b	it 's that mountain right there , I can tell , then ; Yeah . ; Right , then I 'll drag it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1519	aa	Hey , that 's the same percent relative , ; But it 's ; so ; Yeah . Right .
Bmr021_32	bk	So do I . ; I prefer these , ; but I don't mind using those . ; Right .
Bmr009_190	s	Yeah . ; But And so in in these he 's got that . ; Yeah . ; He 's got some pictures .
Bed009_966	%--	and Maybe this is um more adequate for English ; and in German um set processing is used . ; Set . ; Maybe yeah .
Bed012_630	aa	So we have , uh Believe it or not , we have all the bottom ones here . ; Well , I ; You added a bunch of nodes , for ? ; Yep .
Bmr001_825	s	Yeah . ; Ah , the internet . ; They should all be in India right now . ; That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are .
Btr001_611	ba	except I think there was one British English speaker ; and that was easy ; but ; Wow , that 's difficult .
Bns003_739	g	Yeah , ; we we ; I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force . ; OK ?
Bed008_777	s	not in the current ; No we have to enter the park . ; OK . ; Eh almost by definition um paying involves entering ,
Bro019_1634	aa	Oh , ; I see . ; That 's sort of the point . ; But Yeah .
Bed003_750	g	because we Th - the way we set the probabilities might not have ; Yeah , ; it 's it 's an it 's an issue , ; right ?
Bro024_1849	s	Um , ; yeah , I did that ; but it doesn't matter on SpeechDat - Car , ; but , it matters , uh , a lot on TI - digits .
Bro016_320	s	in which case we want to adjust that ; and then continue with with what we 're doing . ; Right . ; And as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front - end also then becomes a priority for this particular test ,
Bed015_659	bk	and may maybe he 's wrong . ; Anyway , so ; I think the the " designate " that we have in terms of meaning is really the " highlight this thing with respect to everything else " . OK ? ; Right .
Bmr031_1093	%--	Mm - hmm . ; and , um ; But it has to be multi - stream . ; Th - they
Bro021_844	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . In the ; Because it 's a little bit different of the other method . ; Well , we have
Bro014_1316	%--	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't have . ; And so you said this is pretty
Bed015_1173	s	And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . ; So " path " , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . ; Mmm . ; And you know , " container " that you can go in and out .
Btr002_3394	s	OK . Sure . OK . ; I would appreciate the " pron " , come to think of it . ; Good . ; But the other three i just so long as it 's clear to me , w you know , from the comment which of those three it is , then I 'm fine .
Bmr030_756	s	D D is full . ; DD 's full . ; That was the first one . ; Or , that was the last one that w filled up ,
Bed003_409	b	but it could be , you know , based upon hour ; Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1004	s	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; But that w ; Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation
Bmr027_99	bk	But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that ; w ; in case , uh you know , " by the way this is your last " ; Right .
Bmr021_458	s	Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes . ; No if I if I had done it on purpose I would have timed it right after I left . ; But , um ; Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings
Bmr012_1252	b	Yeah . ; That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things , ; I 'd love to hear what they have to say . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_757	aa	You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word ; is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words . ; It would be very inefficient . ; Yep .
Bro014_1490	%	and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too . ; After the after , uh , the result for the TI - digits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people . ; Yeah , but ; Y
Bmr003_263	s	Or t ; you know . ; Yeah . ; tapes .
Bed012_883	aa	should we start on Thursday ? ; OK . ; And not meet tomorrow ? ; Sure .
Bed014_718	s	If you 've recognized the word , ; you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , ; so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a uh , you know , thirty percent increase in probability of entering . ; You So you could you could you could invert invert the whole thing , so you s you tag that information on to the lexicon
Bmr016_1324	aa	So , I 'm gonna I 'm gonna I 'm gonna check ; That that 's known as " found data " . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Acsu - actually yeah .
Bmr008_398	s	I don't know . ; OK . ; I think I think you can put " optional " ; I mean I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think would just lie about it .
Bed011_1090	s	For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah . ; Yeah . ; We could sit down and think of sort of the the ideal speaker utterances , ; and I mean two or three that follow each other ,
Bmr026_989	s	Uh . But that was a that was a good good good way to start . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's ,
Bmr003_1964	s	Yeah . ; And it ; Which produces also site maps . ; it 's - it it 's very powerful .
Bmr020_960	bk	That 's what I just said , ; Sure . ; yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_713	b	You know , it 's just uh something that 's easy to parse in Perl . ; Um . Probably for the full one , we 'll want to do something like S T ; I mean , some format that our tools already work with . ; Yeah .
Bed014_1225	bk	yeah . ; Sure . ; Yeah . Right . ; OK .
Bed011_47	s	So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . ; Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . ; And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . ; so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters .
Bmr026_1235	qrr	and that 's the one that Eric trained up . ; Right . ; And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech . ; Was that gender - dependent or independent ?
Bmr010_1482	b	Yeah . ; uh , and , uh , uh , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours , ; I had the impression . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1598	s	Yeah , ; that 's right . ; right ? ; And you know , it could be made more precise than that
Bdb001_750	bk	But an example would be " find all the cases in which Adam started to talk while Andreas was talking and his pitch was rising , ; Andreas 's pitch " . ; That kind of thing . ; Right .
Bmr006_513	s	Bye . ; That 's alright . ; See you . ; OK .
Bro004_1276	b	right ? ; So they did something . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1017	s	OK , so this doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , ; which is , um , the discourse situation context record , ; right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line ; and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on .
Bmr025_701	ba	first , I never take notes anyway ; so I 'm not gonna use it , ; um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . ; And I have uh so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea ,
Bed008_210	qy	I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . ; Well ; Oh just uh accidentally erased this , ; I I just had values here such as uh um is he s we had in our list we had " Is he staying in our hotel ? " ,
Bmr010_993	b	They 're , um they 're trained in linguistics . ; Good . ; They got ; Uh - huh .
Bmr020_1045	b	w without really stopping . ; I mean i they , i ; you know in writing you have this two spaces and a big gap ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr002_541	s	But not if it costs more . ; Right . ; Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard was at least , I mean , the output was that they had speaker turns ; and they um analyzed it in terms of , you know , " this is where this speaker change came in "
Bed016_559	s	because it 's actually important , ; which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general ; but cover only base cases . ; And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal .
Bmr003_496	s	Got it through the LDC . ; and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that ; Great . ; unless of course they have funding issues
Buw001_1467	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . ; OK . ; And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down .
Bro018_248	bk	Aha ! ; Yeah . ; I know . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_340	%--	OK . ; That would be OK , too . ; I mean , I 'm i ; So , if they have a set that they worked with ,
Bro019_1579	b	and I 'll get three or four of these pairs ; Yeah . ; which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . ; Hmm .
Bmr024_491	b	Yeah . ; but , um , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than ; But ; Yeah .
Bed006_264	s	but uh ; the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects . ; And so , the person can maybe make a mental note that " ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here " ; and " I wanted to maybe take a picture of that "
Bmr030_651	2	Right ? ; Cuz it 's all ; Because the whole point is that it 's extracting pie pars parts that are loud anyway . ; It 's all speech .
Bmr023_560	no	Well . ; That 's what Adam wanted . ; Mm - hmm . ; And I don't remember how we ended up .
Bmr019_876	b	So , I mean ; It seems like she if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around , ; since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that . ; Right .
Bed015_1815	aa	There 's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . ; Yeah . ; But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? ; Right .
Bmr010_362	ba	this is a new development . ; OK . ; Super . ; Super .
Bro023_1716	br	Well . ; So , it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one . ; Because ; What ?
Bmr020_300	s	but this obvious thing to see if if there 's a dependence on the number of uh participants . ; Good idea . ; I mean ; I bet there 's a weak dependence .
Bsr001_1970	b	you know ; Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces ; but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1292	b	Well that 's a good news , OK ? ; Yeah . I think so . ; But anyway , um based on your uh uh initial scenario I believe because Bluetooth is on one chip , ; Yeah .
Bmr027_846	s	Yeah . ; You might as well just respond to the mail . ; And ; And we actually need a third thing .
Bmr002_729	%--	Well I know that I know that um the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce does not come out in STM format . ; on our speaker phones . ; Right . ; They they basically give
Bmr027_418	bd	They have opt in and opt out . ; And there are two different ways . ; I mean , and either way works ; probably , I mean .
Btr002_1227	bk	Hmm . ; But " six " and " eight " ? ; " Eight " , um , I remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last " T " . ; Oh .
Bed015_742	s	So , um , like " stress " , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's just a ; uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device .
Bed004_271	b	but um you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . ; And and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent . ; Mmm . ; Yep .
Bmr012_664	aap	certainly doable . ; Um . ; Yeah and ; well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training ,
Bed011_500	b	Attend , ; yeah . ; So it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things , ; Hmm , mm - hmm .
Bed004_778	%--	And ; Yep . ; um ; Maybe we sho
Btr002_2498	s	U i cu there 's there 's at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different . ; You know , there 's like , you know , that , ; Right . ; and there 's like , um , you know , well , the one I did before that 's like
Bed004_276	s	Um . Now , I signed us up for the Wednesday slot , and part of what we should do is this . ; OK . ; So , ; my idea on that was uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists ,
Bns001_592	b	Yeah , ; Oh , yeah . ; UC Ber - uh Berkeley , ; Yeah .
Bed005_1346	bk	That 's that 's al different question . ; I mean , th the first , they had to make a design question , " do we take ontologies that have instances ? ; or just one that does not , that just has the types ? " ; OK .
Bns002_209	g	because we are only allowing one transmissio one transmission at a time . ; Because uh , well , we cannot allow several transmissions , several high - powered transmissions at the same time ; because one is interfering with the other . ; OK ?
Bro023_922	s	Mm - hmm . ; or assuming , uh , ergodicity that i that i um , across time , uh , it 's uncorrelated . ; But if you just look at a quarter second , uh , and you cross - multiply the two things , uh , you could very well , uh , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero . ; So in fact , the two signals could have some relation to one another .
Bed003_164	b	The ; Exactly . ; OK . ; Hmm .
Bmr003_2046	bk	That that 's the six tables that we 're looking at . ; These six tables here , with with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here . ; OK . ; I see .
Bmr001_690	%	But I mean if we if we want Jerry 's group to use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers , ; right ? ; Right . ; Cuz .
Bmr028_461	s	Oh , is that right ? ; Oh . I saw him I saw him on Tuesday . ; Yeah . Otherwise , it 'd be a good idea . ; Yeah . He popped in .
Bro017_177	s	So , so so this is so this is where it is . ; So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected , ; like noise separation . ; Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically ,
Bmr013_228	s	Right . ; So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . ; Yeah . ; And , depends what you 're interested in .
Bmr027_1289	bk	Onto Abbott , ; So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? ; the file server . ; Oh , oh . OK .
Bmr002_592	s	Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions . ; Yeah . ; I should 've ; Although , they actually have a nice tool for that could be used for speaker change marking .
Bmr031_1273	s	Yeah . ; Um , ; you know , f apart from getting preparing the the da the data for the , ; um for these experiments for the , um , uh for this prosody workshop ,
Bed004_845	s	Alright , so that 's that 's the that 's the thesis level ; Mm - hmm . ; uh ; It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs
Bmr015_254	%	that 's not on our side , that 's on the U - dub side . ; Oh . ; And so U - UW set it up as a moderated list . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1153	s	I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult ; because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . ; Right . ; Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see .
Bmr020_1558	s	but there is none . ; So that that can be a lot when when it 's really a breathy channel . ; But I think that 's less of a problem . ; They 'll just listen .
Bmr016_1411	b	Arg . ; It does . ; Arg arg - max , arg - min , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_809	s	Yeah . ; Um It was something similar to n on - line normalization finally ; I mean , in the idea of of normalizing ; Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer ,
Bed015_131	s	Good . ; And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . ; Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . ; So so by saying if I just said " Name one " then that means name one formal
Bmr005_1417	%--	You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained . ; Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . ; Yep . ; And the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and
Bed002_280	s	O or later . ; You have to al also have to read some digits . ; Afterwards . ; OK . OK . Afterwards is fine .
Bro022_1177	no	ask them their opinion . ; Uh , ; Mm - hmm . ; I don't I don't have a good feeling for it .
Bmr028_829	d	So . ; Yeah . ; Um , I think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do , um , a recognition , uh , pass on one of the PZM mikes for these s same meetings that you 've been gi n gi bi ; For the meeting ?
Bmr028_86	s	So do you have to pad that out ? Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ? ; No . I the audio file you can specify any sampling rate . ; Or ? ; And so I s I specified instead of , you know , sixteen thousand or eight thousand , I specified a hundred .
Bro011_478	s	yeah , the target for the training of the " AND " " AND ' ed " things is something that 's kept uh as a hidden variable , ; and is learned with EM . ; So he doesn't have ; Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that
Bmr005_563	%--	I I found that nnn that eh , ehm , pr probably , ; Did Did you ; I 'm not sure eh by the moment , ; but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh
Bed015_1973	g	Um , ; No . ; not really ; just on the constructions , right ?
Bmr010_474	s	uh , ; uh , we wanna , ; uh ; and Dan Gel - and Dave Gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation .
Bed013_116	s	I mean ; just the fact that we 'll get The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ? ; It 's it 's uh ; Well , I 've I 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years .
Bro024_142	bk	Yeah . ; Pretty common . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro024_688	aa	Uh - huh . ; There is a l a There is a lot of Uh , there are a lot of utterances with music in with music in the background . ; So there is ; Yeah .
Bmr011_401	aa	So if you just looked at ; Yeah . ; Oh , that 's another cl cue , ; that 's true .
Bmr023_464	s	We should have . ; Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there . ; And then , Jane also s prepared a um , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to . ; So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have
Bmr020_1169	%--	Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that . ; The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it . ; So . ; Well , it
Bmr003_1808	bk	But I think for a first try that 's about right . ; So so if we hired a who if we hired a whole bunch of Dan 's ; That 's right . ; Yeah .
Bro021_1242	s	And I know everything . ; Uh , with the , ; nnn ; when I develop this in s Taylor Taylor series , I can't , um , calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the Gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech .
Bmr029_498	%--	So I agree with you . We should we should , uh , do the you know , this sort of cheating experiment . ; OK . ; Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes , ; and then , uh , in order to
Bmr014_402	aa	Y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word ; right ? ; It 's one token from the from the corpus . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_1393	s	So . ; Oh , OK . ; That 's all I had . ; So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription
Bmr021_121	s	OK . ; Yeah . ; Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired . ; OK , n now may maybe I just don't know this
Bro021_462	b	We can see that . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Mmm .
Bmr026_301	s	and and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , ; we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have ; and , the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . ; So I think For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it
Bmr015_418	%--	I I 'm ; Well they fund ; I don't remember . ; they
Bmr028_491	b	Most of them , though , really were visitors here and Lila should have contacts with them . ; Yep . ; Nice meetings , by the way . ; Yeah .
Bro028_998	s	Yeah . ; So it 's a ; So i so it 's actuall ; it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way .
Bro007_280	co	Yeah sure . ; Yeah ; Yeah . ; so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great .
Btr001_1177	b	Oh that 's true . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , they would . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_93	s	Can I I I just ; And they just filled it in . ; How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ? ; It was like a hundred twenty ,
Bns001_1784	s	at a certain time . ; And I try to motivate the people . ; That it 's free . ; That 's a starting .
Bed009_142	aa	no ? ; Uh Thursday morning should be fine . ; Eleven ? ; OK .
Bro027_1675	s	Right ? ; And then ; But , ; yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet .
Bmr013_136	no	s it 's gonna be , strange . ; I mean the prosodics are not the same as TI - digits , for example . ; Yeah . ; So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have .
Bmr015_1180	s	and , uh , we we didn't have noise , ; we didn't have convolutional errors , ; we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth , ; and moving your head
Bro027_565	%--	Yeah . ; So it 's like s five , six cepstrum plus delta ; at nine nine frames of ; And then ten milliseconds for
Bro027_1300	s	" Babble " , it 's a stationary background plus some voices , ; Mm - hmm . ; some speech over it . ; And the other two are rather stationary also .
Bro024_223	s	Mm - hmm . ; just sort of to de - emphasize the jarring . ; So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do . ; But then , yeah , the LDA i uh , is interesting because it would sort of say well , suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion ,
Bro012_1073	no	I think it 's easy to do better ; because it doesn't work at all . ; So . ; I I don't know which which one .
Bro021_793	%--	because ; Hhh , ; Are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation ; or ?
Bro024_147	s	but , u uh , ; yes . ; No , it is interesting . ; And the other thing is , I mean , there 's two sides to these really small , uh , gradations in performance .
Bed003_1255	%--	so this would be just something that where you want to pass it . ; Hmm ? ; Is that it ? ; However these are of course then
Bro012_256	aa	but that 's not allowed . ; But not allowed ? ; Yeah . OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1587	s	OK . ; Alright . ; Alright . ; See you .
Bmr025_201	b	I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . ; Mm - hmm . ; So getting them to compile on Windows might be challenging . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_1380	t1	You know I Some days ago , I bought , like some of you , this kind of things . ; This is a PDA ; eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible , ; Modernistic stuff !
Bmr014_714	%--	I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . ; OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . " ; Yeah . ; And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,
Bro024_1014	s	Mm - hmm . ; What where was the , um the smallest latency of all the systems last time ? ; The French Telecom . ; Well , France Telecom was was was very short latency
Bmr018_430	b	But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly . ; Oh , really ? ; So . ; Huh !
Bro016_72	qw	but anybody using the system would . ; Yeah . ; So , ; if you were just adjusting the back - end , how much better would you do , uh , in noise ?
Bro018_144	s	you know trying ; So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference , ; Mm - hmm . ; but that might not be the right number .
Bmr021_141	aa	Huh , I remember that now . ; if we just got two more of these ; I think that 's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately , and have them available . ; Yeah .
Btr001_2350	b	Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ? ; Hmm . ; Like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere ? ; Mmm .
Bmr001_189	s	um And I 'm still not sure . ; I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this . ; Yeah . ; I can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but it 's kind of a buy .
Bmr016_1457	b	Mmm . ; Right . ; But . ; Yeah .
Bro013_53	x	Yeah . ; OK . ; It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? ; Nnn .
Btr002_2718	s	I wouldn't , uh i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put " breath " and we leave it in . ; But absolutely there , yeah . ; Good . OK . ; " Laugh " , change it .
Bmr010_1521	s	but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it . ; Yeah . ; To overrule , yeah . ; So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it .
Btr001_1256	bk	Yeah . ; " Laugh , period " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1341	s	and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , ; you know , got you most interested ; uh and uh and and work with it , you know , for the next round . ; Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem .
Bmr027_953	s	Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . ; And then , um , we , uh I sent him a pointer to three more . ; And so he 's off and working on those . ; Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct
Bmr020_1125	aa	Whi - which could have one drawback . If there is uh a backchannel in between those three things , ; Mm - hmm . ; the the n the backchannel will will occur at the end of of those three . ; Yes .
Buw001_569	aa	I mean , Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , ; I ; Dan ? ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1189	b	It ; But you know , there were i i ; the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts . ; Yeah .
Bro025_357	b	So that 's that 's really not not bad . ; So we may in fact we 'll see what they decide . We may in fact have , um , the the , uh , latency time available for to have a neural net . ; I mean , sounds like we probably will . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_998	qw	Huh . ; What is the c code ? ; Can w can we see that ? ; How do you write the code
Bmr015_1207	s	So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well , ; and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time , ; but then we would still want to account for that ten percent , ; I guess there 's another aspect
Bmr013_294	s	I actually think that data should be used more . ; That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . ; And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , ; because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones .
Bro018_362	%--	Yeah , it 's pretty funny looking . ; So they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two . ; I don't know . ; Yeah , I
Bed010_58	s	But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the the syntax trees for three or four . ; We ; yeah . ; So , the syntax trees are very simple .
Bmr011_669	s	and ; But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , ; Well I thi ; yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do .
Bns003_732	s	w ; it 's not sure , ; Hmm ? No , ; not really sure .
Bro014_493	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , ; you should see , uh , a gentle degradation through that . ; Mmm .
Bdb001_620	aa	So , ; right . ; Um , so it 's like a segment or something . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_906	s	I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them . ; Yeah . ; Good point . ; But he he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly ,
Btr002_1284	s	Oh wow . ; And so it shows , ; I mean it 's it 's useful . ; This is this is why we do these digits .
Bed011_589	%--	You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something , ; Yeah . ; I w we will we will not ask you more . ; ri
Bmr020_1767	co	How w how will they tell the difference between that sort of background and the dormal normal background of two people talking at once ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , I think I think it 'd be easy to to say " background laptop " . ; But wait a minute ,
Bro026_380	s	The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies . ; And they 're not doing that . ; So th So ; So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample .
Bmr022_245	aa	Oh , oh , th oh , I see . ; It 'd be impossible to r to misorder them . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_845	s	And this afternoon . ; and this afternoon , ; it drifted into the afternoon , uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . ; And , um , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data ,
Bro023_6	s	And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , OK . ; So he 's he 's going to be here for about three weeks ,
Btr001_572	aa	Yeah . ; You guys didn't have o one channel per person before ? ; Mm - hmm . ; No .
Bmr030_163	ba	Oh ! ; And I told them , um , if he decides to use multiple examples for , um , the prosody demo , to open up separate Transcribers . ; Just so you don't have to load up files e during the meeting . ; That 's a good idea .
Bmr001_309	s	Right ? ; Right . ; Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh ; uh OK maybe you th you 're the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart ,
Bro017_568	s	Yeah . ; I don't know exactly if it 's ; Uh - huh . ; I think it 's about right .
Buw001_2040	s	Well , I just as as as a contributary ; eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . ; They 'll just say , you know you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " . ; So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to .
Bmr012_776	b	yeah ; Right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us . ; so ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_479	s	So , now , this , it cannot do anymore . ; Nothing comes out of here . ; A " not a number " is a value . Awesome . ; So , it doesn't speak German anymore ,
Bed012_683	b	This this Friday . ; OK . ; Oh . This Friday ? ; Ugh .
Bmr003_574	qrr	which isn't uh , very time - consuming . ; Mm - hmm . ; I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? ; Or is it real is that what we 're talking about here ?
Bed005_374	s	This is sort of what happens . ; This is what you would need to to change to get the , uh , XML changed . ; So when it encounts encounters " Day " , it will , uh , ; activate those h classes in the in the XML stuff
Bro003_1396	aa	So you 're just having a problem converting the labels . ; It 's it 's ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro026_182	s	So ; Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . ; This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it . ; I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech ,
Bmr005_1416	bk	One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week . ; You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained . ; Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time . ; Yep .
Bro014_1420	s	FFT . Filter bank , ; no ? ; yeah . ; It 's on the filter bank ,
Bed004_490	s	we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem ; and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask , ; that you can give input ; and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you ,
Bed004_298	s	Yeah . ; So , I don't I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to to to make a big presentation . ; I don't think you should ; you don't have to make any new uh PowerPoint or anything .
Bmr005_1405	b	So then that would double what we had . ; Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW ; uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , ; Right .
Bro012_1395	s	but if you if you know what was said ; and ; But the problem is that their models are all word level models . ; So there 's no phone models that you get alignments for .
Bed012_676	aa	Cuz of Memorial Day ? ; Yep . ; We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1307	s	and similarly , probability of ; so this is probability of E ; s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four ; and probability of V is one out of four .
Bro019_1037	%--	And then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating HTK scripts to ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I don't know . ; There are they have there is no
Bmr028_127	s	But the the wavefile part looks looks good . ; OK . ; We should If you were having problems with the words , we should figure out why . ; I I 'll have done I 'm probably doing something wrong .
Bed015_2113	s	Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse ; Mm - hmm . ; plus the situation and the user model . ; And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the the net that you just wrote
Bed002_220	t1	So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , ; um , and ; focus on that object down ; Oh , I can actually walk with this .
Bed011_472	aa	Yeah . ; Well no , they could still choose . ; They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle . ; Exactly .
Bed009_944	ba	Yeah ; Oh , I haven ; yeah ; that 's getting it from the lexicon is just fine .
Bmr003_483	bk	CSAE . ; Corpus of Spoken American English . ; S ; Right ,
Bed005_1028	%	Yeah . ; New terminology ? ; Well , let me pick a random one ; Hmm ?
Bro003_375	t3	So we we really have to do test with a real cross - language . ; I mean , tr for instance training on English and testing on Italian , ; or Or we can train or else , uh , can we train a net on , uh , a range of languages and which can include the test the test @ @ the target language , ; Test on an unseen .
Bmr007_342	aa	Yeah , there 's a lot of backchannel , a lot o a lot of ; Yeah . ; This is really interesting data . ; Yeah , it is .
Bed012_509	s	He wants to know something about the history of . ; So he said , " Tell me something about the history of that . " ; Now , the e But for some reason the Endpoint - Approach gets a really high score , too . ; We can't expect this to be sort of at O point three , three , three , O point , three , three , three , O point , three , three , three .
Bmr019_10	aa	Yeah . ; OK , our agenda was quite short . ; Oh , could you close the door , maybe ? ; Sure .
Bed002_609	s	these We have all these transcripts ; and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . ; Saying , " Aha ! ; here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . "
Bed014_80	s	so you don't have to do too much in the style sheet transversion . ; Uh , yeah . ; Yeah , so . ; The uh , Java the embedded Bayes wants to take input uh , uh , a Bayes - net in in some Java notation
Bmr021_1005	g	Right . ; Because it doesn't spit out zeros , ; it spits out epsilons . ; Right ?
Bmr023_1049	b	Yeah . ; so i it it may not apply . ; But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse . ; Hmm .
Bro017_732	s	But in a in a tr ; No . But you 're running your data through that same model . ; That is true , ; but w I mean , so what you want to do You want to say if uh obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things .
Bro014_867	s	We used , uh , TIMIT ; and we used canonical mappings between the phones ; Yeah . ; We , uh , use TIMIT on this ,
Bro027_491	s	Oh . ; which is done afterwards . ; Um ; So it 's two - twenty .
Bmr006_1521	ar	and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says " Hey Roger " or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? ; No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . ; OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . ; No .
Bmr010_676	s	But ; Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position . ; That 's what I was saying earlier , ; th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect
Bed009_580	%--	and I think this is just for historical reasons within uh , the preparation phase of the project ; and not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner . ; So if there is resistance against changing it , that 's just because " Oh , We don't want to change things . " ; That that not deep reason
Bro004_1418	s	the training would , anyway , ; th the testing uh I don't I don't think would parallelize all that well . ; But I think that you could certainly do d um , distributed , sort of Ah , ; no , it 's the each individual sentence
Bro024_1730	bk	The VAD later will be much better . ; Yeah . ; So . ; I see .
Bmr005_1161	s	but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess . ; OK . ; Um , back on the data thing , ; so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have .
Bmr013_759	s	Yeah , that ; I mean , just from what I 've seen , uh , there are some where , um , you 're present or not present , ; and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group ; Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah .
Bro017_167	s	And I think that this is not the right way . ; Yeah . ; Uh it may be that that ; Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen .
Bmr013_460	b	Yeah that that 's all I was thinking about . ; and , ; it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be ; yeah .
Btr002_810	aa	There wouldn't even have to be any , um ; Hmm . ; But it would play it backwards too . ; I know .
Bro013_403	b	and uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s ; Right . ; I think it 's sixty - five . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_150	s	And we know ; Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ? ; No . ; Or if you did , I didn't include them ,
Bmr028_184	ba	that going from the XML to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast . ; Hmm . ; But then it walks the tree to assemble its dat internal data structures ; and that 's slow .
Bro022_717	b	That 's the only thing . ; Yeah . ; It 's ; Mmm .
Bed015_1130	s	Mm - hmm . ; and ; you know , so so you could imagine that this might not ; So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .
Btr002_2262	b	cuz , you know , I mean , we do that all the time with all other well , lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
Bmr012_1123	%	Like at conferences ; well but there might be a way to say that there are gonna be these different people ; you know r ; See , look .
Bro023_1148	b	Hmm . ; We don't know if they do . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr012_739	bk	are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ? ; There are lots of w there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on , ; OK . ; Right .
Bmr019_1211	s	And then you extract the individual channels again , ; but this time you know where the other people start and end talking ; you know , where their spurts start and end . ; And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were .
Bro026_996	b	See , so her here 's maybe where ; If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , um , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , uh , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr007_1315	s	but ; Uh , well , yeah . ; Because , uh well , I mean once his his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way . ; If it works well enough .
Bro007_268	b	well also just to know the numbers , ; or ; Yeah . ; right .
Bro023_95	s	So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , ; but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ? ; And , um ; So I w bef before , um Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .
Bed015_760	s	And so , um , the like if you said he ; you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh ; Mm - hmm . ; " he walked to the meeting " as opposed to " he ran " ,
Bns002_1018	s	Eh , mainly what they call the practive protocols ; which are um extensions of of uh um back door and link end state routing protocols ; distance vectors , ; sorry , and and link end state protocols ,
Bed010_1002	s	And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in in the neighborhood . ; Right . ; Yeah be uh ; actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of .
Bro025_560	s	But the Guenter 's argument is , like , if it is a non - stationary segment , then he doesn't update the noise spectrum . ; So he 's , like he tries to capture only the stationary part in it . ; So the averaging is , like , different from updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments . ; So , th the Guenter was arguing that , I mean , even if you have a very good VAD , averaging it , like , over the whole thing is not a good idea .
Bed016_262	%--	That 's all about that . ; Then I 'm going to talk about the data , ; you know these things about ; uh , actually I have an example ,
Bed003_765	b	But uh We didn't do this because we felt that there 'd ; I guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually ; We were thi ; Yeah ,
Bns002_818	g	Yeah , but again again , what we are adding with this behavior is , uh uh a little bit more , probably some some uh small part to the uh bit error rate . ; Yeah ? ; then ; OK ?
Bed013_393	s	Setting that aside . ; well , you can say we have done a little bit ; and that 's this , ; and uh sort of the rest is position paper ,
Bed015_526	%--	I mean , I 'm I 'm s curious about how much of the mental ; I mean , I 'm not sure that the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things , is gonna have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff . ; You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of ; I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know
Bed015_2085	%--	W what ; Yeah , sure , tell us what it is . ; Um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but hasn't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows . ; I thought that we would , uh
Bro011_263	s	Uh I I 'm ho ; between the distant ; Right . ; Well or I 'm hoping I 'm hoping Espen will do it .
Bed006_767	b	So it 's just an additional information ; Exactly . ; In the future though , the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action , a domain object , and a rich action description , ; Right ?
Bed016_403	s	you know , like there probably was a little few changes , ; not a big deal . ; Yeah , you could steal anything you want , ; I don't care .
Bmr028_932	ba	N Well . I was just aski ; No . If i i ; Ooo . ; I don't like that term .
Btr002_3032	bk	I put in if it 's , um , unintelligible I put I count how many syllables and then I put in " six X " ; I do that if it 's unintelligible , ; but if I can tell something if somebody goes " r " I 'll put an " R " . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr011_400	bk	Yeah . ; So if you just looked at ; Yeah . ; Oh , that 's another cl cue ,
Bmr011_1188	%--	and maybe it 's already finished ; the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps . ; Uh , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . ; It 's just a matter of , you know , providing
Bro008_461	s	But even after that it 's still , you know , so poor that that , uh , no one could really use it . ; So , um ; I think that 's great that because and y also because again , it 's not something ; sometimes we 've gotten terrible results by taking some data , and artificially , you know , convolving it with some room response , or something
Buw001_435	s	Yeah , sure . ; I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like ; y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , ; you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " .
Bro003_1959	b	Yeah . ; because that 's that 's the other route to go . ; Instead of this , you know ; Mm - hmm .
Bro022_995	%--	And ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Actually , it 's ,
Bmr024_1234	s	Yeah . ; Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard . ; So , uh so then um ; Oh , and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse .
Bmr016_1649	qw	And that 's an underestimate ; Extra forty one if it 's questioned . ; cuz they 're ; Where 's that ?
Bed009_84	s	So , I think that 's probably the the right way to do that . ; And an ; Yeah , so I I actually wanna f to find out about it too , ; but I may not have time to get in .
Bmr026_613	s	And that 's all I have . ; Um ; Let 's see . ; The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that um uh , I talked briefly to Mari
Bed010_208	bk	But but we we 're swit ; and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr025_687	aa	We used them once . ; We we used them a couple times , ; Once ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_1055	aa	You run it ? ; Keep keep both versions ? ; See which one 's better ? ; Uh , yeah .
Bmr027_867	bs	and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . ; But why shouldn't they just email back ? ; So . ; Yeah . Reply .
Bmr008_292	b	Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_141	b	Mmm . ; I mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things ; and so I think having having it all ; Yeah .
Bmr012_741	bk	OK . ; Right . ; like anti - aliasing stuff . ; OK .
Bro022_719	b	It 's ; Mmm . ; Well , I mean , ; Mmm .
Btr001_1523	b	and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it . ; Mmm . ; Huh . ; Right .
Bro016_601	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Yeah , it 's an interesting thought . ; Maybe having something along the
Bro022_360	s	It it i maybe ; i ; If , um ; Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum .
Btr001_2102	s	Gets bored . ; Yeah , ; I mean , there are other things we could expand on and with i in terms of the methodology . ; It 's nice to have a core set of data though
Bmr021_663	bk	Yeah . ; Anant Venkataraman ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr031_675	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , I think there are a lot of ways to do it , ; but Let 's not worry about that now . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_649	s	Yeah , and the question is how extensive this gets . ; I mean , I guess what you really want , is if there 's some information you wanna know ; Mm - hmm . ; So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically .
Bmr013_116	s	Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some some artificial signal - to - noise ratio . ; It was just people driving around in a car . ; So , that 's that 's an indication , ; uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth ,
Bed004_485	s	But the uh the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully ; and uh ; Alright , well , le let me think about this some more , ; and uh see if we can find a way to present this to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .
Bmr001_863	s	Sure . ; OK . ; How many more you got ? ; Oh I on I did ten but I can I have a script to generate them automatically .
Bro008_53	ba	until Saturday midnight , or something , we have ; W we we have time , ; yeah . ; Well , that would be good .
Btr002_3245	s	We add the ; So , if so in the examp i in the instance in which ; Let 's say that , um , Morgan 's talking , ; uh , so , he 's talking .
Bmr005_1280	%--	anyway , I shouldn't say too much , ; but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . ; And so it 's ; i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now
Bmr005_917	bk	Yeah . ; but eh I I don't co eh I don't count eh the the overlap . ; The overlaps . ; OK .
Buw001_1662	d	i ; but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the ; That 's right . ; And your email is ?
Bns002_501	s	And delayed . ; And so there 's no advantage to uh if it 's aborted , by by any data packets . ; Yeah . ; So this um node has to stop each transmission .
Bed003_941	h	Close it and and load up the old state so it doesn't screw screw that up . ; Let 's see . ; Oops . ; Hmm .
Bdb001_1112	b	And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , uh , you know , anchored , clear . ; And it would just end up on a separate ribbon . ; So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that . ; Right .
Bed011_245	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; So this is a question for you , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_677	s	This is a ; the fact that we 're calling this " action schema " right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this " action schema " . ; But what that means is we have here first of all ; on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of Source - Path - Goal actions
Bns001_1668	s	what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by , ; like the industry is already behind this . ; Yeah , what is our ; So they they want to make this available pretty soon .
Bmr019_1733	s	And I 'm sorry by the result of overlapping , ; because , eh , I haven't good results , eh , yet ; but , eh , I I pretend to to continuing out to Spain , eh , during the the following months , ; eh , because I have , eh , another ideas
Bmr011_68	%--	So , ; OK . ; Wha ; But if anyone has
Bro010_429	s	Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . ; Yeah , ; um ; Before after VAD
Bro019_1517	s	and compare that to the to the listener tests . ; And , um . ; So , I gave him a PLP spectrum . ; And to um he he t wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they 're moving .
Bmr029_828	s	I 've I I have to check . ; In any case , I could retrain short models within a few hours actually at if I use machines at SRI . ; I wonder about that , though . ; I mean , because all we 're doing The only reason we 're using the short training set is is for speed .
Bmr027_496	s	uh , ; h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to ; Mm - hmm . ; That was the kind of dispute I was making before .
Bmr016_2251	s	Right . ; Um , ; and so it 's a question of like what ; So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals .
Bro004_440	ar	Uh . No . ; You mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? ; Digits on another language ? ; No .
Bmr030_620	s	Well , that 's true . ; Are How big are these files that we send to Brian ? ; Uh , pfff ! ; Half a gig .
Bed016_812	%--	is ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . So th
Bns001_260	s	The benefit here is , in principle , that the results are available . ; They are not restricted any way . ; If you have your own common activity . That makes a little bit more easier . ; And , uh , if there is a technical linkage between such , uh um , between the outer world and us OK , the better it is .
Bro027_122	ar	Um , ; So it was ; and on and on the , um , um , TI - digits also ? ; No , no , no .
Bed017_219	%--	No , not yet , ; um ; OK . ; So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is
Bro024_178	s	Mm - hmm . ; I guess one thing that might also be an issue , uh , cuz part of what you 're doing is you 're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds . ; Um , ; and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance .
Bmr025_72	s	And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK ; Yeah . ; and we get the transcript back ; and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them ,
Bro027_2058	aa	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that 's a proposed date , I guess . ; Yeah ,
Bed016_617	b	But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . ; Mm - hmm . ; And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading . ; Yep .
Bmr003_1134	b	we have to have a short meeting . ; That 's very interesting . ; Stop talking ! ; Yeah .
Bsr001_199	%	Yeah , ; the uh , ; Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow . ; No .
Bed002_1155	s	Mm - hmm . ; you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level . ; Um , Michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts ; and he does it all in MATE ,
Bmr031_152	bk	And I haven't actually caught up with , uh ; since I got back so recently from my vacation . ; Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone . ; Oh .
Btr001_795	s	Right . ; Oh , I see . ; Oh , OK . ; Unlike like a " tuh " or a " kuh " that just stops .
Btr001_278	bk	I it 's a good question . ; Um , ; And I can't really answer that . ; OK ,
Bmr007_450	bk	So it 's just , um ; Right ? ; I was commenting about this . ; OK .
Bed006_530	ar	OK , that much from the parser and generator side , ; unless there are more questions on that . ; So , no sample generator output yet ? ; No .
Bro024_290	bd	Um , ; and I think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training I 'm sure vary from place to place . ; But I think the ideally , it seems to me anyway , that you you would wanna do the same thing in training as you do in test . ; But that 's that 's just , uh , a prejudice .
Bed012_144	co	o on this ? ; or know the location ? ; Or does he want to go there ? ; Let 's assume this is our our question .
Bed002_365	bk	Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually . ; What ? ; Now I remember the email . ; OK .
Bro005_528	s	Yeah , ; and we have only forty forty feature ; So . ; because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature .
Bmr006_454	s	I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; But it als It it it also I think builds up towards the goal .
Bed005_296	qw	OK , so it is set - based . ; Alright . ; One thing I was wondering was , those percentage signs , right ? ; So , I mean , why do we even have them ?
Bmr020_1063	no	So , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context , ; but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap . ; OK . ; Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as .
Bns003_714	b	but ; But it is not , uh , something your teacher provides you some research papers and you , let 's say , build a simulator or try to . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_523	s	as long as you have ; uh , you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string . ; You know , so " zero zero two " ; The problem is that they 're a lot of fields .
Bro017_972	s	yeah , with with a mean of zero and basically zero variance . ; right ? ; Variance . ; So , when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score .
Bmr019_1849	ba	So it 's background crunching . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Is , eh , a another acoustic event .
Bro004_1338	s	It 's got s slots for eight , ; uh IBM was donating five , ; I think we only got two so far , ; processors .
Bed006_1060	%--	and and and they they are obviously , via identifiers , identified to be the same thing here . ; Yeah . ; See that that bothers me that they 're the same thing . ; No , no , just the
Bro019_1358	%--	Mmm . ; So n neural network uh , is in some sense equivalent to computing , you know , higher - order moments of what you ; trying to f ; to
Bmr022_1275	ba	You can mark a file as as " you can't check this out " . ; Oh . ; So ; CVS is pretty good .
Bro004_1233	bk	I I think they 're ; Um . I don't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it . ; They 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , I believe . ; Oh , right .
Bmr018_830	s	I forgot the digital camera again . ; um , ; Every meeting ! ; you know , they 're time - aligned ,
Bmr011_568	bs	Right ? ; So ; I mean , it seems ; Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming .
Bed012_502	s	and just hand over the ones where we have a winner . ; Yeah , because that would be the easiest way . ; We just compose as an output an XML mes message that says . " Go there now . " " Enter historical information . " ; And not care whether that 's consistent with anything .
Bns001_78	s	Mm - hmm . ; I hope there will be a match , uh , then , for his future work . ; And the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail . ; I believe we still haven't left our starting position .
Bmr016_2238	ba	Yeah . ; you know , it takes a couple hours t to do , uh , ten minutes . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I don't doubt it .
Bed003_1794	b	It could it could be used for not just this task . ; It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , ; it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_10	s	Mah ! ; Number one . ; Yep . ; Sibilance .
Bsr001_2286	s	in the other meetings we have . ; yeah . ; Yeah . ; And they 've been collecting digits too .
Bro013_696	s	He just does um mean subtraction , ; which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum ; and that 's supposed to d um deal uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation ; and um the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer
Bmr025_101	%--	do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , ; uh of hits . ; What what kind of uh what does that look like ? The string that you type in . ; What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ?
Btr001_643	s	I was just gonna say something . ; I was gonna say that , ; I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody 's voice if it 's the same if , uh , that person 's voice is the same ; if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe , like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to uh , speakers of the same sex .
Bmr008_142	s	But I I agree that this is that w the rea the motivation was things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research without being threatening to the person . ; But but but it 's gonna depend on who 's ; And this particular form ; I know .
Bed010_489	s	So he 'll get you some data . ; Yeah , ; u OK . ; Yeah , I mean I I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those ,
Btr001_2586	b	OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth , ; you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said , ; and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all , ; Mmm .
Bmr010_226	s	OK . ; OK . No , I was j curious . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application ,
Bmr028_1638	s	I actually think that Thilo 's n in a in a k a You know , when you do the pre - segmenter and you and you run across troubles He he runs across s some of these that are ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Some of these things are captured by Yeah . Um , by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever ; So , we have some part of that .
Bmr027_77	s	So , that 's what I set it . ; Oh , OK . ; Oh . I just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data . ; Oh . I I didn't understand that there was something specific .
Bed003_1031	%--	I can probably double cli click on it . ; Or ; Yeah , right . ; n uh
Bro018_1044	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . I mean , yeah , generally in these things you you turn back pruning really far , ; and ; so I I didn't think it would be that big a deal
Bmr015_507	s	Yep . ; It just , uh we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , uh , doing recognition . ; And Liz had some suggestions on naming ; and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming .
Bmr031_1240	s	and we re re - ran ali re - ran alignments . ; And we 're gonna develop a new feature database based on those alignments ; and do some trees and analysis . ; So I 'm kind of in the middle of that .
Bmr013_477	aa	Yeah , exactly . ; Scoot the voicing over a little , because ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed011_1072	b	Mm - hmm . ; whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed013_1130	qw	or should ; Mmm . ; Hmm . Should be both , ; whereas maybe " where is X located " , we find from the data , is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is ,
Bro019_1489	bk	That sure is nice of you . ; So , it may be he needs more than me . ; Oh r ; oh .
Bro027_1426	bk	That that Yeah . ; Well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using PCA , ; but ; Uh - huh .
Bmr026_1113	s	That 's what I said . ; I 'm sorry . ; It 's w ; It 's weird that it got worse .
Bmr026_252	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , that 'd be very cool . ; Yes . ; It 'd be easy enough to add that .
Bro023_1028	g	uh , although I 've just just tested on Italian and Finnish . ; And on Italian it seems my result seems to be a little bit better than the Wiener filtering , ; Mm - hmm . ; right ?
Bmr007_939	s	eh . ; Mm - hmm . ; This this is the idea . ; And if , if you do that , eh eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh of distance in a first step , and then you , eh you get the , eh the hypothesis to the this change acoustic , eh to po process
Bro023_823	s	Cool . ; Do you wanna go , Stephane ? ; Uh , yeah . ; So , I 've been , uh , working still on the spectral subtraction .
Btr001_1380	s	Mmm . ; Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word , ; and I 've seen this , like , within ; well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways .
Bsr001_1874	b	I see . ; Yeah . ; Well , and I think that ; Mmm .
Bmr025_550	s	And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , " oh what did Chuck do , ; OK I 'll do that " . ; So . ; And then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under " participants " they were filled in under " description " .
Bmr002_371	b	Foot pedals ? I 've used transcribing machines . ; That 's fine . ; um But I frankly didn't find it any more use to me than my hand - held taperecorder . ; Oh .
Bmr027_317	s	I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , ; but I had the feeling I should probably respond ; and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date , ; and if you don't hear from me by then " You know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . "
Bro004_1153	b	For single frames I think it would be pretty hard . ; Yeah . ; But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2215	s	So that that was the whole issue with the LED , ; Yeah . ; that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and and and you 're live . ; Oh , then it comes on .
Bmr024_854	b	and and we can do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk , I guess . ; Yeah .
Bmr021_205	b	Oh . ; These are expensive ; because they 're quite high quality . ; Right , right .
Bed015_1029	b	Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , ; general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f ; you know , specific X - schema frames . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_306	aa	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , the audio quality is so good ; So they can they can , um , scroll through that pretty quick ? ; Yeah .
Bro016_1159	s	Uh ; uh , there 's a Professor Kollmeier , uh , from Germany ; who 's , uh , uh , quite big in the , uh , hearing - aid signal - processing area ; and , um , Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's worked with him ,
Bed013_1038	b	but they do . ; But , even th for that , there is a student of ours who 's doing a dialogue act um , recognition module . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_101	h	and I 'm just wondering Uh , I mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Uh .
Bro012_1270	%--	I guess what you could do , maybe ; this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream , ; yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth , ; if you do view it as probabilities ,
Bmr024_268	2	Again . ; Mm - hmm . ; Is that most of what it ? ; And correcting .
Bmr025_906	s	Yeah . ; and then another button was " that 's great " ; and another button " that 's f " ; Or like this is my " I 'm supposed to do this " kind of button ,
Bsr001_238	s	I mean , depending where I put it , it press different things , ; Mmm . ; but that 's a @ @ fine . ; I think we have to add that to the to the form they sign .
Bro010_432	%--	Before after VAD ; or ; and then ; So so you know that that that the way that they 're
Bro007_34	b	Three , OK . ; The first is a KLT using several frames of the features . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2002	s	Um , ; but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic ; and also the political ; Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap .
Bro003_1295	b	Uh . ; Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing . ; And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently , ; Mmm .
Bed004_811	s	But what I 'd like to be able to do is to have the way that you extract properties , that will go into different Bayes - nets , be the uh general . ; So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , ; and there 's a language for talking about trajectors , ; you shouldn't have to do that differently
Bmr012_1395	s	So I leave ; OK . ; Yeah . ; He 's in the he 's in the cour two two five D course .
Btr002_2176	b	Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind . ; Mmm - hmm . ; Oh , interesting . ; Hmm .
Bro012_635	br	Oh . ; So the deadline ; When 's the deadline ? ; Hmm ?
Bro011_400	s	Do you remember that guy ? ; Um , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . ; I can't remember what his name was . ; Dang .
Bro028_674	s	so you have to do everything at the level of the features . ; What could you do ? ; And , uh , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling , ; some sort of root or or something of the , um , uh , features .
Bmr027_112	s	So . But I can send a follow - up . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's almost all us . ; I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one .
Bed015_938	fa	Mm - hmm . ; So , the question is actually ; And it would ; oh , I 'm sorry ,
Bro011_721	s	So . ; Well that 's good . ; I think that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another ; some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there
Bed002_479	s	Right . ; OK . ; M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language . ; It 's just a language .
Bed009_318	b	and the things that influence them . ; So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing . ; Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing . ; Hmm .
Bmr013_819	s	and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , ; OK . ; and I could easily give them Jerry Feldman 's meeting , ; no problem .
Bmr018_703	s	but it 's very reduced " I , " ; that 's just aligned to the beginning of someone else 's speech , uh in that segment , ; which is cross - talk . ; So , um , I 'm still tinkering with it ,
Bmr007_280	bk	But otherwise um , let 's say B comes to the conclusion of of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her , ; in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute . ; No , but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two . ; OK .
Bed012_845	aa	How do you pronounce your name ? ; Eva . ; Eva ? ; Yeah .
Bmr022_453	s	Mm - hmm . ; and there were a hundred and twenty - three ; I don't remember . ; It 's forty - five minutes .
Bro004_1348	s	but uh Hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon ; and ; Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be ; once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine .
Bmr021_246	bk	Oh , you mean in the meantime . ; This one . ; In the meantime , right , ; Ah , I see .
Bmr010_677	s	Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position . ; That 's what I was saying earlier , ; th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect ; and , hey , that 's life .
Bmr024_217	%--	About IBM stuff ? ; Uh , Brian I I sent bresset sent Brian a message about the meeting ; and I haven't heard back yet . ; So . I g hope he got it and hopefully he 's
Bmr010_1449	aa	That 's the other problem . ; O - k OK . So let me go back to what you had , though . ; So ; Yeah .
Bed002_485	s	The parser output ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; " Analyzed speech " I think it 's what they call it ,
Bmr027_433	no	Mm - hmm . ; and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form ; that they 've already signed once . ; I don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered .
Bro007_30	bk	Yeah , that 's good . ; So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths . ; So ; Yeah .
Bsr001_790	s	Yeah . ; Always @ @ . ; Yeah , yeah . ; But that 's OK ,
Bmr019_1344	s	That 's another issue , ; but ; By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may you may feel , ; but the the , uh the morning meeting folks actually have an an extra month or so .
Bed008_1063	s	Alright . ; like by the time he graduates , ; OK ; uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net .
Btr002_2194	b	That 's ; I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator . ; I mean , there 's a there 's a blind man in this in this building , ; Oh .
Bro004_1253	%--	I mean ; Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh don't like to divide by the variance of that , ; i w Or something ; but I mean it 's
Buw001_341	s	Well , what it does is provide a different ; And ; Uh , y ; I I think it 's an interesting thing .
Bmr008_1249	s	Mmm . ; Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group ; Right . ; uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning ,
Bmr002_570	aa	and they should be just overlapping things that ; I don't think that we should break Eric 's sentences for those . I think ; OK . So that means that for each utterance , we 'll need the time marks , ; Right .
Bed005_1037	%--	Ah , it takes too long . ; Try let me just say " Landmark " . ; If the thing is a landmark , you know , um then there 's another thing that says if um ; if it 's closed or not , at the moment .
Bmr015_208	b	With when you space them out they don't look like , uh , forty - three anymore . ; Yeah . ; Well , she and I were talking about it , ; Yeah .
Bmr005_83	s	And I don't have it quite right , ; but that kind of thing , ; where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , ; but also the the the causal aspects of the uh floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall
Bmr029_880	aa	and you won't get very very clean models from them , anyhow . ; So . ; So you think it 's OK , then ? ; Yeah .
Bro012_317	s	um for a lot of these cases ; so ; but one one thing I I wanted to check out before I increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re - estimations ; and then they built the silence model
Bro007_555	s	Yeah . ; And and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features ; But ; rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out .
Bro026_348	s	Yeah . ; Their their first system is fifty - four point something . ; Is it ? ; And , uh , we are fifty - three point something .
Bed005_1250	s	And we don't want to write this down necessarily every time for something ; but , uh ; It 'll be students ; let 's see .
Bro022_41	bk	I ; No , I mean , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing , ; but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . ; OK .
Bmr007_78	cc	So it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything , as usual , anything goes beyond that . ; OK , uh , Jane , since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours , ; make sure we get to it . ; OK , it 's it 's very eh it 's very brief , I mean just let me just hand these out .
Bmr016_525	b	Nein . ; That 's right ! ; Yeah . ; Oh !
Bmr005_251	s	but they did say ; You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified ; uh , " in any publication using the data . " ; OK , well , individuals being identified ,
Bro017_1201	b	Yeah , that would make it easier . ; So maybe just call it " Aurora " or something that would ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr001_199	b	Right ? ; If we have microphones in a PDA it 's gonna need bias and a pre - amp . ; I guess I 'd sort of figured that that Jim would do that at some point . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1266	ba	I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them , that were blanks , that no one had actually read . ; Mmm . ; And so we still have more than I thought we did . ; Oh good .
Bdb001_1206	s	Yep . ; Mmm . ; Something like that , ; um , but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this uh , this annotation format .
Bed006_1522	%--	Yeah I I ; I 'm I 'm never happy when he uses the word " roles " , ; Yeah . ; I was going to
Bed011_156	s	Yeah , but I i i it 's happening . ; David and and Jane and and Lila are working on that as we speak . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro004_99	g	results are similar Only on , ; Do you mean if it 's trained only on On data from just that task , ; yeah . ; that language ?
Bro012_280	b	I did notice uh something ; So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part . ; Somebody , I think it was Morgan , suggested at the last meeting that I actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1335	s	Um ; You mean in terms of the topic topics ? ; Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things ; and , uh , just dialogue - wise ,
Bsr001_1700	co	Because they 're a little different . ; Sorry . ; When you say multi multi - stream , you mean ; Hang on .
Bmr009_596	s	Yep . ; That 'd be really great . ; OK . ; And we 'd still have some funding for this project ,
Bed014_1436	s	Mmm . ; DDR , he asked ? ; Speaking of dance , ; Dance Dance Revolution
Bro025_538	s	Is there was there any experiment with ? ; Well , I I did The only experiment where I tried was I used the channel zero VAD for the noise estimation ; and frame - dropping . ; So I don't have a I don't have a split , like which one helped more .
Bmr018_627	s	so that it 's like ; Oh , OK . ; I see . ; And there was this one meeting , I forget which one it was , where like , uh , six out of the eight channels were all , like had a hundred percent error .
Bed015_1324	s	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So . But that that that 's sort of OK . ; The the within the event it 's st it 's still one world .
Bmr025_245	b	That 's right . ; So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh uh , SoftSound guy , uh ; It 's amazing . ; Yeah .
Bed002_855	b	We can show it walks to , you know . ; We can have movies of walking , ; you walking through through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_755	s	And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . ; I should 've got the digital camera . ; Oh well . ; I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones
Bmr005_717	s	Then I think it 's a good idea , because it ; Sure sure . ; Sure , ; because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that .
Bed013_1292	b	where possible . Right ? ; OK . ; If i if if it 's not at all triggered by our thing , then it 's irrelevant , ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_18	s	ve very short introduction , please . ; Of course . ; Eh , well , I 'm working in the em Broadband Commu ; Uh , sorry , one interruption .
Bmr006_258	s	But if there were such a ; I mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . ; Yep . ; So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware .
Bed015_2042	s	Uh , and inheritance is only one I mean , that 's one way to organize it ; but there are others . ; Yeah . ; And it may or may not be the best way .
Bed003_1462	s	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I could be wrong though . ; It was a while ago .
Bro016_570	qy	Mm - hmm . ; Do we know anything about the speakers for each of the , uh , training utterances ? ; What do you mean ? ; Do you have speaker information ?
Bmr003_2324	s	Lax . ; Yep . ; Really lucky with these things . ; But they 're not ours ,
Bed015_751	b	So focus carries along a scope . ; Like if you 're gonna focus on this thing and you wanna know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't . ; Um , so my classic my now - classic example of saying , " Oh , he did go to the meeting ? " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr026_1236	s	Right . ; And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech . ; Was that gender - dependent or independent ? ; Gender - dependent .
Bmr028_1049	b	because I think it would be a pretty big difference . ; When you listen , you can sort of tell where people are , ; It 's a big difference . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1954	%--	Right . And then ; Right . ; J There 's ; th
Bmr008_855	b	di ; the whether they picked it up at the one age or another . ; pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed003_290	s	Um ; Why don't you mention things about this , Bhaskara , ; that I am not that are not coming to my mind right now . ; OK , so Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the sort of , the things that are not directly extracted .
Bed010_364	s	Right . ; and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want . ; Well , we can p If it 's If we can pay ; Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that .
Bed015_1042	s	And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . ; Um , it should be either category or in or instance . ; Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . ; So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in .
Bmr003_2421	ar	You don't ? ; Yeah . ; I do ! ; Yeah .
Bmr026_961	s	So that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a better system ; Yeah . ; um because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News ; and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard
Bro024_534	%--	but the thirty - five percent is way off . ; I 'm sort of confused ; but ; this
Bed016_870	s	No no no , but not for your talk . ; Oh , OK . ; I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes ; Oh , the thesis !
Bmr031_724	2	So . ; But he wants to go to new servers not just for us ; but for other groups too . ; For u the whole institute .
Bro005_529	b	and we have only forty forty feature ; So . ; because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . ; Yeah .
Btr001_829	no	Yeah . ; Completely . ; Yeah , ; I I don't remember the words exactly .
Bro024_1626	t1	Yeah . ; Your your smoothing was @ @ uh , over this s so to say , the the factor of the Wiener . ; And then it 's , uh ; What was it ?
Bed013_773	s	Well , l looking at ; yeah , looking at that paper that that you had , I mean you know , like , you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the XML cases or whatever ; you just sorta said well , you know , here 's the general idea , ; some stuff gets put in there .
Bmr015_815	s	So if there 's more than one speaker , ; um ; yeah I guess you could I guess ; yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced ,
Bed004_815	s	for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , ; for uh telling someone else how to go there , ; Getting out of ; whatever it is .
Bns002_415	bk	That 's the case ? ; That 's it . ; That 's ; Yeah ?
Bro014_1234	t3	Ah , no . ; This is this ? ; More close . Is this ? ; And this .
Btr002_1636	aa	Oh . ; or ; I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related , ; Yeah .
Bmr003_1661	s	Because suddenly ; I mean , I don't know , ; actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels . ; But assuming we can get around that somehow .
Bmr021_0	s	 ;  ;  ; If you 're popular .
Bed015_250	s	and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? ; So the ball is the head of the phrase , ; " the r the " , um , " big red ball " , ; and the entity denoted by the word " ball " is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element .
Bed015_1232	s	And then have it part of the speech - act in some way . ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's some negation . ; But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold ,
Bed013_1316	s	Well , it 's because you also want to know this , or something like that right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; So it 's like you infer the speaker intent , ; and then infer a plan , a larger plan from that , for which you have the additional information ,
Bro016_752	%--	Eh , PLP is very much like mel cepstrum . ; MSG is very different from both of them . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , if it 's very different , then this is the sort of thing
Bro014_839	s	So ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So we have the mel f filter bank ,
Bro005_645	s	and on the large database , ; so , with SPINE and everything . ; And , ; mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts .
Bro024_213	s	for this mean subtraction approach ? ; Is is that right ? ; Or for these long analysis windows , I guess , is the right way to put it . ; I guess , the the the issue I was the general issue I was bringing up was that if you 're have a moving moving window , uh , a wa a a set of weights times things that , uh , move along , shift along in time , that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter .
Bmr020_503	s	End of spurt . ; So whether there was a pause essentially here , ; because spurts are a defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses , ; and then we had things like discourse markers ,
Bro008_57	s	That 'd be good . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Uh , and , you know , i u when whenever anybody figures it out they should also , for sure , email Hynek
Bmr003_1852	s	Hey , what about me ? ; w What ; OK . ; You 're the one who raised the issue .
Bmr031_1089	2	Mm - hmm . ; And for those type of tasks , it wou it 's much more efficient to present , uh , the th p present a bunch of , uh , clickable buttons or whatever ; Dialogue . Yeah . ; Buttons .
Bro026_877	bk	Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify . ; Are you looking at these in narrow bands ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , right .
Bmr028_1577	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But ; It 's saying that my experiment is bad .
Bmr016_1991	s	I 'm sorry I 'm I didn't follow that last thing . ; So , so gloss in the same line that would have " gloss quote one one one dash one thirty " , you 'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying , uh , " curly bracket NUMS curly bracket " . ; Right . ; So if you if you did a , uh , a " grep minus V nums "
Bro028_791	s	Um ; Mm - hmm . ; So if he 'll ; he might work on improving the noise estimate
Bed005_11	aa	Right . OK . ; OK . ; So , we all switched on ? ; We are all switched on , yeah .
Bmr006_1260	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . OK , it just it just seemed to me that uh , that this isn't the ideal type of separation . ; I mean , I I think it 's I can see the value o ; Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them ,
Bro014_1248	b	Oh , yeah . ; And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , that that has the effect of both , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1354	%--	because if we use the standard , uh , frame length of of , like , twenty - five milliseconds , um , what happens is that for low - pitched voiced , because of the frame length , y you don't really have you don't clearly see this periodic structure , ; Mm - hmm . ; because of the first lobe of of each each of the harmonics . ; So this one inclu is a longer Ah .
Bmr016_628	b	There were several speakers in it , ; yeah . ; That 's right . In fact I I pulled out a couple classic examples in case you wanna u use them in your talk of ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_1353	b	so it 's interesting to get your get your feedback about it . ; It 's another type of approximation because i because it 's a statistic statistic approximation to remove the noise . ; I don't know . ; Right .
Btr002_2829	s	but , um , I just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions . ; There 's no ; I mean , unless you have really aw ; I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward .
Bmr010_317	s	and ultimately that path will be smoothed out . ; So I don't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing . ; I think we had a very quick need to get something out ; and we 'd like to be able to do some later
Bmr021_450	s	So . ; and ; No , it was I was still here . ; It was the day I left .
Bed015_21	s	So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on ; but I 'll just pass out as is right now . ; So , um , ; here .
Bro014_471	b	So ; Same microphone ; but ; Yeah .
Bmr019_228	s	So my expectations is TI - digits would , especially ; I think TI - digits is all American English . ; Right ? ; So it would probably do even a little better still
Bro017_1121	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Maybe . ; And and do that for each one .
Bmr023_205	%--	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And , yeah , using Thilo 's , you know , posteriors or some kind of or
Bmr018_254	aa	That was the question . Though . ; So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing . ; Yeah . ; Uh . That I agree .
Bmr027_61	s	We had spoken w about this before ; and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once . ; Yeah , but I 've forgotten . ; And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity .
Bmr010_846	ba	Oh , I didn't know that . ; OK . ; that would probably be , uh , sufficient to train models . ; That would be a really interesting prosodic feature ,
Bmr011_134	b	Yeah . ; So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bro023_1711	s	Um ; It seems to be , ; uh i ; Actually what I observed is that for Italian it doesn't seem Th - there seems to be a problem .
Buw001_432	aa	Those aren't the kind of things that come up . ; But at least it would get us started . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , sure .
Bmr003_2307	aa	Well , it 's useless for this function . ; Works fine for holding a Kleenex , ; but it ; Right ,
Bro025_575	b	And , um , relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is is pretty ; I mean , you might , you might not . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_943	2	yeah . ; but I think ; Yeah . ; But including the features .
Bed010_843	%--	But we aren't gonna ignore those ; cuz we 're we 're not only going The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . ; And how much we build , and and so forth . ; I
Btr001_1067	b	Mm - hmm . ; give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr016_1100	s	three on this side . ; And I stapled them . ; OK . ; Alright so , first of all , um , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures
Bro023_659	s	and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF . ; So sometimes that becomes zero ; because you do you don't have a true estimate of the noise . ; So the f filter will have like sometimes zeros in it
Bro022_301	b	But , not so much , I guess . ; Well , yeah . ; But it 's trained and tested on the same thing . ; Mmm .
Btr001_2787	b	" Each line into smaller groups . ; Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated . ; Hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr018_1629	s	Machine - learning . ; and and the the , uh , ; one one person ga g g got up and made a a brief defense , ; uh , but it was a different kind of grounds ,
Bmr001_106	b	This is these are things we will find out . ; That 'll be an issue . ; Yep . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1489	s	uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative , ; but but , uh , ; I mean , the missing thi ; so so what they were saying it 's one of these things is you know , all you need is more data , sort of
Bmr024_1600	aa	Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth . ; Sixteen to eighteen , I think . ; Is that it ? ; Yeah , sixteenth , eighteenth .
Bro003_1018	%--	OK . ; Yeah , ; so , I mean , ; you don't wanna ,
Bro014_1277	aa	Um , ; but whenever you smooth you lose something , ; so the question is have you lost something you can you use ? ; Right .
Bed006_1491	b	anyone here ? ; Oh , uh ; People reach their level of uh max their level of at which they 're incompetent or whatever . ; Yeah .
Bro004_706	b	But , well it 's similar . ; So uh I retrained the networks with these ; well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1256	%--	Transcribers , he was rattling the b marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this ; Shall we do digits ? ; Oh yeah . ; Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch
Bmr020_1841	d	in what we send . ; So , the part where they 're using sounds from their from their laptops . ; With ; with the laptop sound ,
Bro022_295	bk	But just it being bigger if with the same signal - to - noise ratio ; It w i i it wouldn't affect things . ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bmr018_1509	%--	And , uh , they were started off with a million words that they used , ; which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using . ; So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion . ; And then they had this log scale showing a
Bro025_81	b	and , uh , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression . ; But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro005_662	%	So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on ; one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ; ten on ten different databases . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_500	bk	You 're just taking the keywords as a topic text , ; I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content . ; as ; OK .
Bro017_860	s	you can't do that . ; Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . ; But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca ; well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record ,
Bed014_288	s	you know some just some weird place . ; And , uh , yeah , I I 'm surprised I didn't know about it ; Y yeah . Well , yeah . I was like , why didn't Dan tell me ? ; since we know all the invited speakers ,
Bmr027_821	b	Yeah . That 's right . ; Uh , I got email , ; and it i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail . ; Hmm .
Bed013_915	no	Cool . ; In a vaguely obscene fashion . ; No , this is a RME core by agent design , ; I don't know .
Bed002_927	s	She is a graduate , OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . ; I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that .
Bmr030_449	b	Line out , yeah . ; Line - out into the line - in on a tape player , ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm .
Btr002_621	s	That 's that 's what I th ; It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones . ; And actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora , they did run into limitations ; and uh , certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach
Bmr014_229	s	uh , radio - mikes . ; Right . ; Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets ; meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something ,
Bns001_1100	s	Yes . ; that shouldn't be your only way of ; There 's a gate You can put the gateway ; if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it , as a light stack or something .
Bed003_845	s	It seems like it 's equivalent to say that it doesn't have a door a and it ; Mm - hmm . ; Or " not public " and " not a door " are equivalent things , ; it seems like in practice .
Bed010_190	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Got it . ; It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff .
Bed014_811	bk	Yes . Excuse me . ; OK . ; Yeah , that That 's the point , is is th ; Yeah .
Bns002_636	b	It provides you more gain when you are transmitting but also when you are receiving . ; so , in general , in general even when if there uh if there i are different antenna gains , uh , you 're getting mainly bidirectional channels . ; Only when you have a an important uh power difference is when l um , the communication can only work one way . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_775	s	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; And and Morgan had that funny hair again . ; Yeah . Well , I mean you black out the that part .
Btr001_869	s	Yeah . ; Uh there 's ; it 's it 's funny how , um , ; i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes
Btr001_2665	%--	Yeah . ; and sometimes they say " zero " , ; Mm - hmm . ; but
Bed015_64	s	Well , there 's an example ; the textual example at the end has clausal construction . ; So , ; um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful
Bmr030_610	b	Mmm . Mmm . ; You can , ; but they never will be able to read them . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_39	cc	I mean , that was ; Uh , @ @ tuss close talking mikes , ; better quality . ; OK , uh , we can talk about that .
Bro028_264	b	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; something that 's different . ; I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there . ; Uh - huh .
Bed016_924	b	but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . ; Yeah . ; So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that ; Mmm .
Bmr006_566	bk	Two copies . ; Yeah . ; One offsite , one onsite . ; Oh !
Bed002_467	s	Or is there a focus on the path ? ; or something . ; And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona ; you know , th the In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter .
Bro003_735	b	and everything else the same . ; Compare that with just M - MFCC without the the net . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr001_748	ar	No . ; right ? ; You would send I mean , uh a transcriber is used I mean , I don't know , assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting , ; No .
Bmr028_124	ba	but ; Sorry . I got the wavefile , ; but I couldn't get the words yet . ; But the the wavefile part looks looks good .
Bed006_285	s	Mm - hmm . ; So they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ? ; Yeah it 's a schematic tourist map . ; So it 'll be uh i it 'll still require the that information
Bed002_61	s	but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . ; So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like . ; Um . ; On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can .
Bed015_762	%	Mm - hmm . ; " he walked to the meeting " as opposed to " he ran " , ; or " he did walk to the meeting " as opposed to " he didn't walk " . You know , ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1644	b	Um , ; no , ; I did not . ; Mmm .
Bmr031_712	b	We could change a smaller disk for a larger one . ; We should probably do that while we have the space left on the on the th the existing thirty - sixes , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_584	aa	and ; Yourself ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr027_1273	bk	OK . ; Right ? ; That are going into the main f file server . ; OK .
Bed006_39	s	this is great . ; Yay ! ; Um , apart from that , sort of the old gang , Johno and Bhaskara have been with us from from day one ; Hi .
Bed011_738	g	Right . ; anyway . ; Scooters , ; right ?
Bmr029_882	%--	So you think it 's OK , then ? ; Yeah . ; In fact , if if you wanna do this , uh , to speed things up , um , you we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether . ; That hurt
Bro024_1809	s	but the final result are not still mmm , good like the Wiener filter for example . ; I don't know . ; Maybe it 's @ @ it 's possible to to have the same result . ; That 's somewhere
Bro027_868	%--	y ; but it goes down a lot more , like fifteen percent on the HM case . ; You 're just using the full ninety features ? ; The
Bed008_408	s	is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . ; So that it uh ; that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important ; but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other .
Bmr027_766	s	like . ; Did you read that paper ? ; No . ; It wouldn't work .
Bmr011_83	s	Alright , that seems like a a good collection of things . ; And we 'll undoubtedly think of other things . ; I had thought under my topic that I would mention ; the , uh , four items that I I , uh , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting ,
Bmr003_2211	b	Mm - hmm . ; An - and there 's only there 's only four slots that are you know , in in the first version or the version we 're planning to to build . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2626	qh	Yes . ; and so you need to i inhale , ; Yes . ; and so how do you transcribe the inhale ?
Bmr010_1281	bk	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Yeah . ; OK .
Bro003_1187	b	Uh , th uh , thirty hours of speech , I think , ; It 's a few hours . ; something like that . ; Hmm .
Bed006_186	2	Cuz we have you know people from other areas ; that 's what I suggested to him , that people like like Jerry and George and et cetera just ; Yeah . ; advertise in their classes as well .
Bro023_1110	s	The th they actually do the filtering in the time domain . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; So they would take this HF squared back , taking inverse Fourier transform .
Bns001_603	bk	Uh , sorry ? ; Uh do ; Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_133	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . There ; uh , actually , yeah . ; S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero
Bro027_918	aa	Maybe that 's it . ; Because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results . ; But I guess if you 're keeping the number of Gaussians fixed in the recognizer , then ; Well , yeah .
Bro017_482	s	But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be . ; Similar , yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; I d I don't see reason why it should be worse .
Bro003_2003	b	Now the fact even though it 's a smaller number , it 's still fine ; because you have the the , uh , combinations . ; So , in fact , it has every , you know it had has has every distinction in it that you would have the other way . ; Yeah .
Bro024_1894	s	Uh ; Yeah . ; Uh ; But I observe my case it 's in , uh , uh , at least on SpeechDat - Car it doesn't matter
Bed005_943	b	OK . ; So , e enough of that , ; but I , uh , um , ; mmm ,
Bmr007_295	s	Yep . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; So we go over So we were we were talking over one another , and it 's just in each case , it 's just sort of one interval .
Bmr019_1400	no	This is not a ; um . ; So . ; I don't know .
Bmr022_1040	s	Well , I I was ; and then give them access . ; I was reading through some of the CVS documentation ; and you can just substitute CVS for your R S H command .
Bmr029_422	aa	cross there . ; We need to re - do that with small models . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro018_543	h	Yeah . ; OK , and you were saying something starting to say something else about your your class project , or ? ; Oh . ; Yeah th Um .
Bro022_398	bk	So that was done already . ; So we were ; Uh , and it 's point eight ? ; OK .
Bns002_510	ar	So , his transmission is aborted . ; Yeah , but this is typical for MAC layer protocols , you know . ; Not ; No .
Bro019_1295	s	You did some experiment . ; Yeah , ; yeah . ; Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything ,
Bmr021_683	bk	So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place . ; So that it 'll work on all the NT machines . ; Well , I mean , as it stands , I I guess ; OK .
Bro027_1279	g	Uh . ; But , yeah , ; actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises ; and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ?
Bro022_797	s	to find a ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us . ; But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore ,
Bro021_1064	bk	One and ; S uh , i th we can put here the set transformation . ; Oh . ; I see .
Btr002_1297	b	So its ; Right . ; " ground truth " , as they call it , is very clear . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1060	s	because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right set of features . ; Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . ; So , um , uh , ; here at least you 're starting off with all of them ,
Bro024_1660	bk	Uh , actually I d I do all the smoothing . ; but it 's smoothed ; Ah . ; Oh , it w it was you .
Bed013_1133	qw	whereas maybe " where is X located " , we find from the data , is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is , ; and " how do I get to " is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there . ; Right ? ; So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question .
Bsr001_1577	t1	I I mean , I haven't been in these , uh , you know , preliminary de decision meetings , ; but I don't know what 's the idea for the computer interaction . ; I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ? ; Wizard of Oz .
Bmr016_2027	s	where we 're gonna have a master file of the channelized data . ; Um , there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these t these main two uses ; and th some scripts will take it down th e into a f a for ta take it to a format that 's usable for the recognizer ; an uh , other scripts will take it to a form that 's usable for the for linguistics an and discourse analysis .
Bed011_67	s	and so Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . ; So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up , ; and , the kinds of decisions . ; So the uh uh on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values .
Bed015_1406	b	And therefore you 're supposed to say , " Boy , life sure " ; You know , " in France kids are allowed to drink at age three " . ; And w you 're that 's not just a fact about France . ; Right , right .
Bmr010_1485	aa	Yeah . ; and , uh , there should overall be a , um , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed006_1086	b	Mm - hmm . ; Between you guys ; uh ; Yeah .
Bro004_194	s	So . ; Yes . And it 's something like one point three of of the uh ; I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , ; you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task ,
Bro019_372	s	because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant ; and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . ; But um , ; I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot ,
Bmr025_15	s	Who 's that 's probably you . ; I can do that quickly . ; Um I hired several more transcribers , ; They 're making great progress .
Btr001_240	b	but I don't know any . ; OK . ; That 's interesting . ; Hmm - hmm .
Btr002_70	ba	That 's what I was just thinking , ; or maybe it was really quiet or something ? ; I don't know . ; Maybe very very soft .
Bed014_617	aa	Yeah . ; It 's In some ways it 's not as good ; but it 's the implementation we got . ; Yeah , sure .
Bns002_1570	bk	I will send it electronically . ; When ? ; After the meeting . ; Ah !
Bro003_1730	t3	Let 's fall back to that . ; But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something that , uh , an an additional ; Uh , ; that 's a good thing you remove the mike .
Bro007_231	d	and I think it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least . ; Ye ; But words well word I don't know . ; Hmm ?
Buw001_1926	%--	I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders . ; Yep . ; Right . ; I mean , that that 's
Bed014_1249	b	Yeah . Well , if if I mean , i part of of what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet . ; Yeah . ; That 's fine . ; Yep .
Bed005_687	s	OK . ; It seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg . ; OK ? ; But you know , i depending on what people are interested in , one could have , uh , tours ,
Bmr021_461	ba	Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings ; Mm - hmm . ; for like six meetings . ; So I think they 're split up even further .
Bmr011_47	s	I mean , maybe maybe it 's something we should handle outside of the meeting . ; What meeting ? ; No , no , that 's OK . ; We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week
Bro011_138	x	uh I was talking with Hynek about it later ; and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . ; And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things ; but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you
Bro007_430	b	yeah . ; So recognition performance is just the top part , actually . ; Uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1515	b	whatever , ; Boston . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1551	s	We we could do that but that would mean changing the code . ; I mean this isn't a program we wrote . ; Yeah . ; This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on .
Bmr027_545	%--	I mean ; OK . ; Yeah . ; I mean , I 've been through this
Bmr018_363	s	or they 're looking ; what what are they looking at visually ? ; Well , they have a choice . ; They could choose any signal to look at .
Bro023_466	%--	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering ; which is more like a musical noise or something . ; And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering , the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,
Bro014_1259	aa	It 's not really what 's happening in the vocal tract ; Yeah . ; so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation . ; Right .
Bmr020_342	s	Nope . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully .
Bmr002_1423	bk	OK . ; Good . ; Well , I hear what you 're saying . ; I 'm glad .
Btr002_1280	ba	And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins . ; And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh , very very good results . ; Right . ; Good .
Bmr006_994	s	Context window ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I think this is a good place to start .
Bed002_507	s	We have to request it . ; Right . ; Nuh ? ; But it 's not in there .
Bmr020_458	%--	Yeah . ; but but it 's f i i ; That 's OK ; but
Bmr024_1222	ar	No , no . ; Oh , sorry . ; No . ; No .
Bed005_804	no	Yeah . ; You will . ; And how soon , ; I don't know .
Bro016_273	%--	and Uh , we might just not even be in the right operating range . ; So , would the ? ; Uh , would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well - matched case ? ; So , if we computed what the range was in well - matched , and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it have the same range as ?
Bns002_576	g	Yeah but but ; yeah ; but the but in this case , you know this this idea , this uh geometric idea , can be can be , if you want , uh deformed because of some obstacles . ; OK ?
Bmr008_595	b	and have a set of circ of six or seven circles ; Yeah , that that 's good ; but if you have it totally free - form First of all some people take you ; Yeah .
Bmr025_494	s	I mean they 're on th right , these , ; but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . ; Yeah I I never ; And I don't think Chuck was either
Bmr028_91	b	Um , ; and , the only problem with that is that there 's a bug in Transcriber , ; that if the sample rate is too low , when it tries to compute the shape file , it fails . ; Hmm .
Bro018_658	g	and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing ? ; And didn't they like exponentiate or something ; Um Yeah , ; and then divide by the sum of them ,
Bmr009_1622	bk	so I can Well , I can wait for the digits but I can't stay for the discussion ; Uh - oh . ; Oh . ; OK .
Btr002_384	s	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exactly . ; Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of " twosome gruesome " ,
Bed011_776	%--	Yeah . ; And if no no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important , no planner is ever gonna ask for it . ; Yeah . ; y so And I like the idea that , you know , sort of
Bro028_958	s	And I guess that is like a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . ; And I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , um , PLP . ; I should learn more about that . ; And then the second stage is , um , the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do .
Bmr002_1026	%	Yes . ; Well there 's They have a special project , as I 'm remembering , ; and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1162	no	Yes . Right . ; But maybe he speaks about spurts as well ; We ; and I just don't know .
Bmr023_878	s	Hmm . ; Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental ; but it you know , I I don't know it yet . ; And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something ,
Bed015_1808	s	Like there 's not so many different ; Certainly not as some ; hhh , I don't know , m ; Well , they 're intonational markers I think for the most part .
Bsr001_1720	b	So that , uh , ; I think just just having stereo will help ; cuz they 're a little different . ; Yeah .
Buw001_2261	b	Like e expert systems and stuff , ; or ? ; Hmm . ; Uh - huh .
Btr002_2795	s	Yeah . ; I don't know if it 's It could just be because there 're so many more hours I haven't been talking . ; Hmm ! ; I guess I try to be more careful in my speech , more often .
Bed015_336	ba	Right . ; Um , so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there ; but ; That I I have no problem with it at all .
Bed013_572	s	Yeah , it depends on the format . ; Oh my gosh . Oh , I thought you were I thought we were talking about something ; which was much more like ten or something . ; No that 's I mean that 's actually a problem .
Bmr005_1131	s	oh yeah , ; noise . ; So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . ; It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,
Bed016_247	b	and ; the generation outputter . ; Halfway done ? ; Yeah .
Bro003_208	s	Yeah . So . ; So - so we had talked I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ? ; Is that a possibility for that ? ; Ye - uh Yeah , but , uh these corpus , w w there is a CallHome and a CallFriend also ,
Bmr014_56	%--	the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . ; It might be a connector . ; Oh , OK . ; Well maybe
Bro026_941	s	anyway . That 's my thought . ; OK . ; You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually . ; I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot .
Bsr001_427	ba	I mean , you think you think if you ; What 's the purpose of the ; Training s Training speech recognition systems . ; It 's too hard .
Bmr025_1041	aa	Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , ; absolutely .
Btr001_2430	s	But it 's just you know , to say " uh " you kn to say " uh " while you 're laughing i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category . ; Right . ; I think it may almost have to do with like , " OK , ; I told a joke ,
Bed015_2235	ba	Four ? ; Yeah ; no , no , no , uh , I don't care . ; It 's fine .
Buw001_784	%	We 're talking about a snapshot . ; Not for not for CMU . ; So ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1273	%--	if you do view it as probabilities , ; and if it 's an independent ; So , if it 's if it 's uh not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based , ; uh looking at harmonicity or something like that ,
Bed008_1364	bk	So you can view these as gone . ; OK . ; Probability of ; OK .
Bmr031_813	aa	Yeah . There 's there 's just a few , uh , ; so . ; Do you want to write on the l on the board ? ; Um . Yeah ,
Bmr028_574	bk	It combines them if it 's if the pause is longer than ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's no more than six words . So Roughly . On average . ; Ah .
Buw001_2115	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , I think ; Well , once we send out ; I mean , we still haven't sent out the first note saying " hey , this list exists " .
Btr001_94	b	I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses ; cuz I think it 's sort of safe , ; cuz people can people can say their acronyms really fast ; Uh - huh .
Bmr031_1227	s	Bush 's . ; Yeah , you 're both , you know , sort of He 's he 's coming back to the heartland ; and ; Yeah , right , exactly .
Bmr031_905	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Oh , how nice of you , ; holding holding the thing so I 'm not ; It was falling off , uh .
Bro013_757	%--	or they write down ZERO ; a and they and they each have their own pronunciation . ; Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the " O " . ; But people wouldn't know what that wa
Bed014_311	ba	Oh ! ; Uh , w Which is mental spaces and uh and - or ; Hmm ! ; It 's hard .
Bed002_418	%--	So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? ; And you probably need intermediate nodes . ; I we don't know what they are yet . ; So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether
Bro018_609	b	So a long time ago people talked about things where you would have uh a condensed nearest - neighbor , ; where you would you would you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent to to correctly classify everything that came in . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_884	br	Well that does raise another question , which is why is the " Professional use only " line not higher ? ; Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ? ; Oh . Because we 're filling in other things . ; What ?
Bmr014_432	s	and " GLOSS " for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . ; Right . ; I already had that convention ; but I I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically
Bmr011_1155	b	Mm - hmm . ; yeah . ; Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday ; yeah .
Bmr008_1614	b	Just separate out from the from the normal things , ; Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . ; separate out voiced . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1589	%--	That that 's the sort of w we keep you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances . ; Yeah . ; Th - That that would work . ; Yeah . I mean , but but the main I think the main thing is that
Buw001_1744	bk	OK . ; Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . ; OK . ; Oh , yeah .
Bro028_173	b	And ; so Well , things are not optimal ; and ; Yeah .
Bmr029_467	s	I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way , too , ; because you have leakage into other microphones . ; Right ? ; But , it 's just you 're using the fact that this is where this person is .
Bro023_331	%--	But that 's what I 'm confused about , ; cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering . ; No , ; it 's like , uh ,
Btr002_2026	2	and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Who won't talk .
Bmr024_638	b	So . ; OK . ; This was all ; Yeah .
Bro007_169	b	Um let 's see that one ; Well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right ? ; That 's just uh ; Yep .
Bmr003_2352	aap	Well of course we do . ; And how do we want to do that ? ; You mean like see see meter readings , from while sitting here . ; J just so we see something .
Bmr027_143	bk	And the reason I liked it was because ; as opposed to , uh ; was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it . ; Right .
Bed003_699	aa	What if the context , which is not set , but still they say things like , " I want to go uh , see the uh the the castle and uh , et cetera . " ; Is it ; Well the I kind of thought of " doing business " as more of running an errand type thing . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_683	no	Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , ; Yeah . ; M ; but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not .
Btr001_1879	aa	Yep . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yes .
Bro010_26	%--	Ah , right . ; Yeah . ; No , that would have been a good thing to find out before this meeting , ; that 's .
Bro027_210	ba	Is it already ? ; Yeah , ; the semester 's late late August they start here . ; Yikes .
Bmr024_1457	s	um ; So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . ; And and then we train from scratch . ; So we com we do a , you know , w um We collect the uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train .
Bro018_1013	%--	I don't know . ; Could be . ; You know , you 're sort of getting most of the way there , but there 's a ; So I started going through and looking
Bro026_377	s	And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . ; But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . ; But there 's one difference . ; The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies .
Bro015_226	s	I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states . ; So , and ; OK . ; Yeah , apparently , um they had better results when they increased the number of states .
Bro016_855	s	No . Again you don't really look at that . ; It 's something that , ; and then it 's going through this transformation that 's probably pretty close to ; It 's , eh , whatever the KLT is doing .
Bmr002_752	s	Oh , good . ; It must be It must be fundable then . ; " KCM file formats " , ; Oh , looks like Looks like uh work packages .
Bed002_1109	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able We can couple . ; Yeah .
Bed008_1365	b	OK . ; Probability of ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bro005_479	s	um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , ; but let 's let 's consider what that means . ; What what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that ; I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation .
Buw001_952	bk	Right . ; Yeah . ; It 's just ; Right .
Bed003_1175	aa	Uh that 's future future work . ; Does ; That 's ; Yeah .
Bro003_2021	s	I don't know if you know this for your testing data , ; but if you know for your test data , you know , what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned , then you can just instead of going through the net , just create the vector for each phone and feed that in ; to see if that data helps . ; Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature .
Btr001_1645	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . OK .
Bmr016_992	s	so I don't I think it 's all just ; It 's fine . ; You know . ; Fine to do it however is convenient .
Bro024_1344	qy	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Uh , ; But did you use channel did you align channel one also ?
Bed010_1003	b	Right . ; Yeah be uh ; actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1648	s	That 's much simpler . ; I don't know what they said ; but I know the number . ; Th - that part 's definitely gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later .
Bro017_72	aa	Right . ; right ? ; I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy . ; Right .
Bro012_609	%	Right . ; and ; But yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_562	b	and disk space and storage formats from Don . ; Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ? ; Well I was actually gonna skip the ASR results part , in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1102	s	OK . ; Alright so , first of all , um , there was a an interest in the transcribe transcription , uh , checking procedures ; and and I can tell you first , uh , to go through the steps ; although you 've probably seen them .
Btr001_2786	b	OK . ; " Each line into smaller groups . ; Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated . ; Hmm .
Bro027_1666	b	So I just tried it on Italian just to know that everything is ; But I I didn't export anything out of it ; because it was , like , a weird feature set . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_123	b	Mm - hmm . ; Right , ; so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is is c correct . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1470	s	So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me . ; Yeah . ; Um , hearer is a little bit harder . ; It could be like multiple people .
Bro024_715	%--	That 's just ; So , ; m ; w
Bmr010_507	b	The the transcribers would have less , uh , disentangling to do if that were available . ; Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is , ; But . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr006_1553	s	Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . ; Mm - hmm . ; Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise . ; You don't wanna mention subjects by name in published reports .
Bed003_738	bk	Right now we haven't observed it , ; so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1767	%--	Mm - hmm . ; But a little bit worse for well matched . ; So over all it gets , yeah , worse for the well matched condition , ; so y
Bro027_571	%--	and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? ; For the frame I guess . ; I computed two - twenty ; Yeah , well , it 's
Bsr001_1051	s	Um , you need a task to really , you know , improve your system for that particular environment . ; Oh . ; Mm - hmm . ; So right now we are focusing our research on doing evaluation type of , you know , in incremental you know , improvements .
Bro026_901	aa	Hmm . ; Um , and I don't know if that I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . ; Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , " buh " and " puh " differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1273	%--	so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available ; if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used . ; And uh , ; on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort " that 's
Bed015_781	s	light highlight ; as opposed to other ones . ; So it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh later on . ; Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements .
Bsr001_572	bk	Uh , my hands got better ; Uh - huh . ; so I stopped using it . ; OK .
Bmr023_506	b	Mm - hmm . ; That 's right . ; and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . ; That 's right .
Bmr030_643	b	Yeah . ; Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed . ; Were " shortened " . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_818	s	This this approach here This is Uli Heid from Stuttgart ; is um a query language for research in phonetics where he wants to build in ToBI tags ; and so you can determine ; um I wanted to mention this to you .
Bro017_60	b	Because uh ; but in that case , uh we would like to change the uh the algorithm ; because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks . ; Right .
Bro028_97	no	but it 's , uh , m mainly a problem of memory . ; Right . ; Um , ; and I don't know how much this can be discussed or not ,
Bro023_514	s	And ; and what I t what I tried was , by using the same thing ; but Uh , ; so we actually found that the VAD is very , like , crucial .
Bmr020_1494	2	so that they should only write down the transcript if they 're sure . ; Yeah . ; And otherwise they should mark it so that we can check . ; Mark it .
Bmr008_702	bk	cuz he does make a good point about the region ; Specify the age range . ; not necessarily again , if you 're on the army base or ; Right .
Bro004_910	%--	Um For the moments we do not don't have nets , ; um I just wanna understand ; so You have two net or three nets ? ; Was this ?
Bed009_466	s	and that 's ; OK ; ah also because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already ; maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to to Markus and Michael .
Bro021_1196	s	This is the methods that say that we 're going obtain this . ; Mm - hmm . ; And we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of E minus a function that conditional to E to the T to the noise signal . ; Well , this is this function is the the term after develop this , the term that we we take .
Bro012_335	s	Mm - hmm . ; And if I 'm do running an experiment right now where I 'm changing the number of iterations ? from seven to three ? ; Yeah . ; just to see how it affects the baseline system .
Bmr016_1299	s	Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to " laugh " , there 's another one ; which is " while laughing " , ; " While laughing " . ; and that is , uh , i i An argument could be made for this tur turning that into a qualitative statement
Bmr018_857	s	Well maybe Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful . ; yeah . ; Right . ; I mean , that that would be really helpful .
Bed013_564	bk	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Well , you said it was four thousand lines ? ; Oh .
Bro021_399	s	and ; Yeah . ; Well , all th all three of you . ; I think we were gonna work with with this or this new system ,
Bmr020_1138	%--	Yeah . ; which is the second stage is um , w what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data . ; I discussed this with you too . ; Um , the tr
Bmr008_163	%	Oh . ; Oh , OK . ; Ah . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Btr001_1231	aa	So d ; They have different definitely a different style , right ? ; Do they end all them all in dots , ; Yeah .
Bed014_545	b	Hmm . ; Cuz there will be other k examples that are one way or the other . Right . ; W we know for sure that we have to be able to do both . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_21	aa	I guess the only other thing , uh , for which I ; We should do that second , ; because Liz might join us in time for that . ; OK .
Bed016_908	s	Yeah . ; Where you can get baked goods . ; Well th well , that 's one . ; You want to buy something .
Bsr001_1592	b	So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it . ; Uh yes , ; OK , OK , OK . ; Mmm .
Bed011_326	s	Maybe I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects ; Mm - hmm . ; and then take a breather , ; and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting .
Bro023_1249	b	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_286	b	Well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation . ; That would ; Right . Uh , but I 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than than the , um , um the , uh , VTL estimation . ; Right .
Bed006_487	s	Oh do I have it here ? ; No . ; The time is now pretty much fixed . ; It 's the last week of April until the fourth of May
Bro010_73	s	Yeah , you should talk with him . ; Yeah , yeah . ; Yeah . ; No , I mean , because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination ,
Bed002_264	s	So this " Tango " means , literally translated , " to touch " . ; So But sometimes the the Tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh ; If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . ; Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code .
Bns001_1715	b	Mm - hmm . ; Something like that is my final vision . ; Like like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM - WDM . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_763	%--	Right . ; but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings , ; Yeah . ; and also revising ,
Bro004_1152	s	it stretches again . ; For single frames I think it would be pretty hard . ; Yeah . ; But if you say speech starts here , speech ends there .
Bed009_357	s	Yep . ; So my suggestion then is that you um look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the action plans are supposed to look like . ; And they 're currently um Agreeing or or in the process of agreeing on an X M L - ification of um something like a state - transition network of how dialogues would proceed . ; and The these um transition networks uh will be what the action planner interprets in a sense .
Bro022_932	s	Then you say that 's beginning of speech . ; Uh - huh . ; But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . ; I guess it depends on how you do it .
Btr001_813	aa	So , um , in did you have you run into places ; I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin . ; Have you had that happen ? ; Mmm , yeah .
Bmr023_407	b	and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um ; Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_1391	s	Course . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration ,
Bro021_861	s	I I 'm actually just confused about the equations you have up there . ; So , uh , ; the top equation is is is ; No , this in the it 's this is the log domain .
Btr002_1734	b	Yeah . ; And I think it 's really cool when people ; start getting really excited about something or angry about something ; Mm - hmm .
Bed005_278	b	or whatever . ; OK . ; " Action watch " , ; Hmm .
Bns002_936	%--	So that 's was the reason for my question . ; Yeah , pero e ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; uh but
Bmr023_844	%--	I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight . ; Yeah . And now we have another percent with the V T ; That 's three point three . ; Um , actually , and it 's ,
Bmr013_394	s	Yeah . ; Well ; Right . ; So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram ,
Bmr020_1471	b	OK . ; Sure . ; When they when there 's either no speech in there , ; Yeah .
Bro024_366	s	So f if it 's really in one kiosk , then I think that you could just chain together and and you know , as much as much speech as possible to ; because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic . ; Yeah . ; But in in the case of the mobile , uh , presumably the acoustic 's changing all over the place .
Bmr026_1010	s	uh , we never did any ; And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , ; right ? ; Where the error rate now is in the twenties .
Bmr028_845	s	Mm - hmm . ; But how do you score ? " ; I think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped . ; I mean it 's just an interesting problem .
Bed006_506	s	Yeah actually , that 's true . ; That ; Anyway , so this is ; Well I 'll be here working on something .
Bmr005_399	b	because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment . ; So i if two or more people are talking . ; I see . ; OK .
Bro018_732	h	or ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; um
Bro007_140	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; Except I don't know because they I think they are still working well . ; Uh - huh .
Bro004_212	b	Mmm . ; OK , fine . ; Let 's let 's use the conventional meaning of baseline . ; Hmm .
Bmr016_2230	s	No I know I know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better . ; and I 'm not sure ; Yeah . ; I mean I 'm sure about that ,
Bro024_1525	b	Yeah I I made s similar investigations like Stephane did here , ; just uh , adding this constant and and looking how dependent is it on the value of the constant ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_606	s	but he thought it was a bad idea . ; In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing uh NW archive to copy it is a good idea ; and we should do that and have it backed up . ; He w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup .
Bro012_1128	s	Right . ; No use of pitch uh basically . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , well , not pitch ,
Bed009_1068	%--	So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; And then ,
Bro011_290	s	So . ; Um what was it , ; there was there was some some some point where eh uh Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel ; and I was saying something to somebody else uh which was in the background
Bed008_1312	b	So that 's step that 's the uh yeah that 's the that 's the basic uh thing . ; Now ; Um ; Yeah .
Bmr027_237	s	I I 'm what I 'm what I 'm I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it ; so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something . ; Mm - hmm . ; So I 'm not telling you what to decide .
Bmr028_1041	b	Or to just do the clustering , knowing that you 're capturing both . ; It 's just that the kind of clustering we 've done before hasn't had that , uh , distance factor , or location factor in it in the same way . ; I see . ; Yeah .
Bro005_496	qo	Yeah , OK . ; Uh , then does that , eh you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , does it does it then look much better ? ; Mm - hmm . ; And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh of tests ?
Bmr019_114	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Probably the fact that it picks up other people 's speakers other people 's talking is an indication of that it the fact it is a good microphone .
Btr002_3328	bk	Right . ; And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr005_811	s	Yeah . ; um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . ; And , it seems to work , ; I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something ,
Bmr016_1561	s	you know how are how are they gonna know ? ; I know ! ; I ; I I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting .
Bed015_151	s	but I mean they 're just us usually they 're going to be value value fillers , right ? ; OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings . ; There was talk of changing the name of that . ; And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like ?
Bmr011_192	ba	and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , uh , more uniformity , ; Right . ; but @ @ but uh , ; sounds sounds fine .
Bed010_834	%--	and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff . ; But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology , ; Alright . ; so , um And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , " is there an ontology API that that "
Bmr012_625	%--	I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way ; but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the ; Right . ; and uh see if it 's , you know
Bed005_488	%--	" I want two seats here . " ; " need two seats here . " Nuh . ; " And where is it playing ? " There should also be a reference to something , maybe . ; Our d This is re um
Bed015_894	s	Or it might limit it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus . ; OK . ; Uh k uh , at at the very least it constrai ; I think that 's that 's , th that 's certainly true .
Bro027_975	s	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you know what the straight features do . ; Yeah . ; That gives you this .
Bdb001_1367	cc	Well , I guess , w I I didn't want to keep people too long ; That 's interesting . ; and Adam wanted t people ; I 'll read the digits .
Bed009_1031	s	And it 's a small enough domain that probably you , you know ; Mmm . ; OK . ; You could do this .
Bed009_185	b	and we 're setting it up so that we can we hope to implant certain intentions in people . ; For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that " How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? " ; OK so you have the castle of Heidelberg ; OK .
Bmr021_874	ba	Um . ; Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation , ; so . Um . ; Also interestingly the Um , the difference actually widens .
Bmr005_970	ar	About twelve by now . Twelve or thirteen . ; Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously ; we 're only recording this one now ? or ? ; No .
Bed009_680	s	Yeah , yeah it it ; OK . ; yep . ; And and the the underlying idea of course is that there is something like kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh certain applications like tourist information or um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on .
Bmr010_957	b	in these recordings . We have this very , very tiny sample of of ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2150	%--	e e better than what it can do , I mean . ; Yeah . ; It 's ; And then I guess
Bed011_191	s	And um And for now uh the the question is " How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? " ; So Um , one could sort of think of ; you know we could call the z see or you know , people who visit the zoo ; we could s call it " Visit the zoo tomorrow " ,
Bro024_1466	%--	OK , ; so basically you 're creating a signal - to - noise ratio of twenty - five or thirty DB ? ; Yeah . ; But it 's not
Bed013_1065	b	and Simspec type things . ; Just ; OK . Just " where is X " ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_557	s	Like the fact Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , " Where 's the city hall ? " , I might say , g ar " Are you trying to get there ? " ; Because how I describe um , t its location uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , " It 's half a mile away " or something like that . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's a granularity factor ,
Bed015_1229	s	you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . ; You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity , ; you know , not don't have it here . ; And then have it part of the speech - act in some way .
Bmr005_723	s	And ; Uh - huh . ; There 's there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , ; and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth
Bmr019_663	no	OK . So the s the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ? ; Oh . ; Yes , we have ; I don't know ,
Bro027_783	%--	Yeah , it 's almost that . ; So ; It 's almost an average ; somewhere around
Bed011_894	s	So " object " becomes " entity " , ; right ? ; Yep , that 's true . ; Yeah , but we don't have to do it now .
Bed004_897	s	So this is definitely interesting , and ; Yeah , right . ; Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti , ; also , of course , not in the sentence " How do you get there ? " was pretty standard .
Bed015_1102	%--	because you can have , um , things like " the guy I know from school " . ; Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . ; Mm - hmm . ; And it 's unclear whether
Bmr003_815	ba	We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway . ; Right . ; So maybe ; Wow .
Bmr016_209	bk	OK . ; OK . ; and , you know , it 's just a matter of u i the instructions , that 's all . ; Great . OK .
Bed015_2186	b	Fri ; Thursday 's my last day here . ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_296	bk	No , no . Praat isn't Praat 's multi - platform . ; No . No , Praat ; Yeah . Yeah . ; Oh ! I see .
Bed015_933	s	I don't know ; the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions . ; So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions . ; So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else .
Bmr009_1023	bk	Mm - hmm . ; and so does um S So do other places . ; Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT , ; Right .
Bed003_1774	b	The the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . ; The data we get from Munich is very command line , ; simple linguistic stuff . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed013_805	qw	I 'm sure you read the transcript of last week 's meeting in red ; so sh so you 're up to dated caught up . ; No . Sorry . ; We decided t that we 're gonna take a " where is something " question ,
Bed015_1082	s	This ; Uh yeah , well there there seems to be context properties . ; So . ; Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there
Bed010_80	b	Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on on on on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . ; And send in a a a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works ; because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_366	s	Please , please ! ; Yeah . ; Age or Approximate Age . ; So somebody can say " thirties " if they 're thirty - nine .
Bmr015_605	ba	I can piece them together . ; I mean , so it 's like , I I know that I can take them apart and put them together and I 'll end up with the representation ; which is where the real power of that interface is . ; And it may be that it 's faster to transcribe a channel at a time with only one , uh , sound file and one , uh , set of of , uh , utterances to check through .
Bed015_464	s	Mm - hmm . ; and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery , ; whereas past is a very conventionalized one ; and we sort of know what it means
Bro005_118	s	Uh , @ @ with SPINE ; Mm - hmm . ; and uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , ; uh , so we have to to redo the uh the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta .
Bro021_405	aa	So ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bmr020_232	b	Yeah . ; Also , I in the Levinson , the pragmatics book , in you know , uh , textbook , there 's I found this great quote where he says you know you know , how people it talks about how uh how how people are so good at turn taking , ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1594	bk	Yeah , so it 's ; so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want , uh American English , ; I wonder if we have any . ; All America , OK .
Bed005_714	b	because there is an ontology , ; and the database , and stuff . ; So it isn't like , um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that . ; Right .
Bmr015_1061	ba	even And ; we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there , ; and , uh , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wanna work with . ; Well this is in very interesting
Bro005_540	s	Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , ; um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . ; And that was that , um , if you have uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances ; if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale the streams .
Bed014_266	b	It doesn't follow logically . ; It doesn't The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph . ; And so on . ; Hmm .
Bed015_257	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1399	s	and then it ends up the end . ; And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward , ; Mm - hmm . ; if you click on the left it moves back .
Bed011_262	s	It would be challenging , in in a sense , to try to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex thing in terms of ; OK , ; you know , they should get the feeling that there are these s six things they have to do ; and they sh can be done maybe in two days .
Bed015_620	b	Yeah . ; OK . ; OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like " profile , designate , focus " , et cetera , et cetera . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro021_100	bk	Um , a third thing is , um , that instead of t having a fixed time constant , I try to have a time constant that 's smaller at the beginning of the utterances ; to adapt more quickly to the r something that 's closer to the right mean . ; T t um ; Yeah .
Bro019_1437	aap	So you live in a cardboard box in the street now ; Yeah . ; or , no ? ; Uh , well , s s som something like that .
Bed003_846	b	Mm - hmm . ; Or " not public " and " not a door " are equivalent things , ; it seems like in practice . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_66	s	Mm - hmm . ; and then you can have lots of different sections , ; each of which have I Ds attached to it , ; and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds ,
Bmr008_1672	s	Yes . ; You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing ; unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly ; Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure .
Bmr012_1397	b	Yeah . ; He 's in the he 's in the cour two two five D course . ; Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course , ; So ,
Bed014_580	b	you know , in th in a ; So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . ; And then when someone asks " where is X ? " you 've already got the the Enter schema activated ; Mm - hmm .
Bro013_445	b	Huh ? ; Mm - hmm . ; but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_14	s	OK . ; Anyway ; Oh , ; so there you go .
Bro017_984	aa	So in fact , that would be ; That doesn't require any retraining . ; Yeah . ; No ,
Bmr001_85	%--	So maybe we should just say it . ; W Why don't you want to fill it out right now ? ; OK . ; Just so that
Bsr001_2356	s	so please pause between ; but it 's very people don't like doing that . ; And so there is this prosodic thing which is which is indicating when whe the pauses between these digit strings . ; And then when they finish , the actual the whole sheet , there 's this nice , wonderful yeah , phrase @ @ .
Bmr022_206	s	My original thought was , you could have a different tone for each speaker . ; You know , there 's plenty of tone space . ; And that might help cue the transcriptionist . ; You know , give them a little cue about where they are .
Bed006_1514	aa	R Yeah , yeah . That 's fine . ; Sure . ; That 's the that was the intent of of it , basically . ; Uh that 's true .
Bmr012_705	s	and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's ; but this this meeting that you have , no problem ; cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself ; It 's us .
Bmr019_519	s	But anyway so I think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those , ; Yeah . ; and in those same segments just use one of the P Z ; Right . So we we can do that .
Bmr002_904	ba	Great idea . ; Signed language is interesting . ; so . ; Excellent idea .
Bed002_1233	s	And what 's the relation to this with Changing the table so that the system works in English ? ; OK . ; So this is Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . ; The the full NT and the full Linux version are there .
Bmr018_249	qy	Why wouldn't we s @ @ w ; Let their ; i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them ; I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?
Bmr008_757	%--	but they had North Atlantic , Mid - Atlantic , and ; You know , Texas was definitely out on ; I mean most of the people from cer certain places in the South were from specific Texas locations , ; but other than that you had a huge range of
Bro027_1900	s	Mmm . ; I think ; I was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , ; and come up with a a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units ,
Bro026_168	s	This this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? ; It was ; Yeah . ; Uh , it 's on the transfer function .
Bmr019_1183	s	Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words . ; And then we 're , ; um ; OK . Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the , uh , tags
Bmr003_662	s	Talking to people about that ? ; I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . ; OK . ; I should 've sent email and I haven't yet .
Bmr018_126	bs	No , I mean , they 're flying up from from ; Seattle . ; down from Seattle . ; They 're flying from somewhere to somewhere ,
Bmr008_201	s	So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y ; oh , that 's right , ; you know I was saying " Professor " . ; I mean a Visiting S Researcher or whatever .
Btr002_2952	b	um , w um , ; I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of segments , which really aren't part of a word . ; Have you run across that where they 're they 're saying ; Hmm .
Bmr019_440	aa	So the To get that , uh , pivoted this way , it pivots like this . ; No this way . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed003_1816	bk	Whereas , you know , if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted , ; we 'd get no cues . ; Yep . ; Alrighty .
Bed016_280	bk	Sounds like Fey . ; Yeah . ; But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , ; Oh , OK .
Bro017_731	aa	You have uh only data . ; But in a in a tr ; No . But you 're running your data through that same model . ; That is true ,
Bmr015_226	s	But ; Yeah . ; Uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it . ; So . I mean , this is something that Liz and I spoke about
Bed011_848	s	right ? ; You know " I want to go there and I don't care if it 's really hard . " ; Or if you 're an extreme sport person , you know . ; " I wanna go there and I insist on it being the hard way . "
Bmr020_166	ar	OK . ; That 's just cuz he talks really fast . ; Do you mean , ; n No .
Bmr031_1018	s	I 'll I 'll I 'll keep saying " uh - huh " . Yeah . ; OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; This is absolutely natural meetings .
Bed006_754	%	OK , sorry . ; I just ; A laser pointer would be most appropriate here I think . ; Eee .
Btr002_1134	s	Yeah , the one in the ; And then the f the far right corner as you walk in ? ; Yeah , r Yeah , that 's that one 's got the the PC keyboard , ; and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard .
Bmr028_1755	bk	Do we have a ? ; I 'm sorry for interrupting . ; Do we have an EDU meeting at four ? ; That 's fine .
Bed003_1494	s	huh ? ; It 's not maybe reality . ; It 's not like German trains . ; Like German trains are really great
Bns003_201	s	but , uh , the effort should be minimized as possible . ; And , so please take a look to the web pages ; and ; I have announced in the project area the major headlines .
Bro017_1222	b	Hmm ! ; u s And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use . ; Just uh ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_852	aa	I 'm sorry , ; there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? ; Yeah , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_758	s	Yeah I I um have I have no ; Robert likes to be abstract ; and that 's what I just thought he was doing . ; You look up here .
Bed006_303	s	and they know that they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them ; or sort of have the label for the object ; because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange German names . ; And then we 're going to have another we 're gonna have w another trial run
Bns003_930	no	The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one . ; But , you see the question is always " Where 's the money ? " ; and I say " Oh poo , ; currently I don't know . "
Bed015_1289	b	So this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this ignoring li ; OK . ; I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . ; Right .
Bro017_711	aa	so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one , ; yeah . ; So for each uh set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ? ; Yeah .
Bmr020_838	b	and apparently it did even better than the original than the original versions , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed005_932	g	And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing , ; necessary , but but not ; Right . ; OK ?
Bdb001_384	s	And just , I mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do . ; Yeah . ; And especially for the prosody work , what what it ends up being is you get features from the signal , ; and of course those change every time your alignments change .
Bmr010_1148	%--	Yeah . ; Th - that 'd be I think that 's a a good idea . ; Yeah . ; You know , there 's also , the e In my mind ,
Bed003_224	s	they 'd all be like pointing to the one node . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh . ; So then our next idea was to add a middle layer ,
Btr002_2713	b	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Btr001_165	s	o or I don't know . ; it 's ; I don't know . ; I liked them .
Btr002_334	aa	Right . ; because their intonation is totally different . ; You mean non - native na Non - native speakers ? ; I mean Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah .
Bns002_820	b	then ; OK ? ; Maybe this frame will won't be received properly , and , should eh have to be eh dropped , ; Oh , yeah .
Bro012_205	s	and then ; but I mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also . ; Uh - huh . ; By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script .
Bmr023_188	b	Yeah . ; That - that 's what I wanted to do anyway , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bed017_121	aa	OK . ; Maybe you have your on - line ; Uh , ; yeah , sure .
Bmr008_306	s	This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss . um , with the digits forms .
Bro010_970	s	And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um , the , uh , ; uh he he did a comparison to , uh , you know , our old foil , ; the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . ; And , um , it didn't do nearly as well ,
Bmr005_1159	bk	So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . ; It won't be that many people who do it that often , ; but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess . ; OK .
Bmr006_25	s	Don't know . ; So uh so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . ; And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , uh , then they can run off . ; It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits ,
Bro017_865	s	I mean y people will listen to it for for centuries now , ; is what you can do , is you train the model uh with the with the original data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Then you decide that you want to see how important C C - one is .
Bro019_1651	%--	So , uh , ; yeah , you 're going back today ; and then back in a week I guess , ; and .
Bro003_360	s	We might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years , ; but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for . ; So so I think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language . ; Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal .
Bmr014_1004	b	Alright . ; the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , ; Fine . ; OK .
Bmr024_345	s	And , um , there 's the issue that that they we know what what was said , but do we ? ; I mean , so one option i ; Because people make mistakes and stuff . ; I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if if with , uh uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error ,
Btr001_1371	b	Yeah , I figured that they didn't . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bmr016_697	s	So . ; yeah . ; So why do you want to do echo cancellation ? ; Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation
Bmr018_1548	s	So so , I mean , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point , ; but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant ; which is not at n t as for as I know in in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true . ; What i what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties ,
Bmr018_702	s	but the first , um , word of what he says , often " I " ; but it 's very reduced " I , " ; that 's just aligned to the beginning of someone else 's speech , uh in that segment , ; which is cross - talk .
Bmr031_66	s	Oh , you just get the door now . ; But he didn't shut the door . ; Yeah . ; I got it
Bdb001_56	t3	I actually mostly need to be able to link up , or ; So ; I it 's it 's a question both of what the representation is and ; You mean , this
Bmr023_798	%--	and give very poorly trained , uh , you know , Gaussians that way , ; Hmm . ; uh , an and poorly trained mixture weights . ; So so , we have
Bed010_773	b	I I think so . ; I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but but s it it it 's getting close to that . ; W what does it feel like ? ; Yeah .
Bmr010_1443	ba	Yeah . Sure . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , OK . ; It 's a good method .
Bmr027_530	s	Sending lots of spam . ; So they s so so Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do . ; Yep . ; And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something
Bro023_882	qw	But ; Yeah . ; So this is something I can still work on , ; So what does that mean ?
Bro004_373	s	But but i it sounds like ; Um , but He Mm - hmm . ; I mean . That 's interesting ; because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh didn't have so much representation of English ,
Bro008_475	b	and n n And , uh , ; uh , with something that 's still relatively realistic , it 's still very very hard to do very well . ; So ; Yeah .
Bdb001_480	%--	Do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ? ; Yeah . ; See , that 's the question . ; I mean , how stable is their
Bed014_1373	s	I was just gonna say , though , that , for instance , there was you know , out of a meeting with Johno came the suggestion that " oh , could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection ? " ; which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about . ; Right . ; In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings .
Bed005_120	s	Bhaskara and I started working on the the parser . ; Then Bhaskara went to class and once he came back , um , it was finished . ; So . ; It , uh I didn't measure it ,
Bed011_877	s	And . if I care about it being open , accessible or not , I don't think there 's any middle ground there . ; Um , either I wanna know where it is or not , ; I wanna know about it 's history or not , ; or , um I wanna know about what it 's good for or not .
Bed005_511	bk	Sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing . ; Yeah , a kid understanding what 's going on . ; Then the next thing we talked about is actually , um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that . ; OK .
Bmr006_273	b	Yeah . ; True . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep .
Bmr002_731	s	Right . ; They they basically give ; um They subdivide into WAVE files ; and then they give for each , they give a one oh , you know , a WAVE file that g indicates where the start and stop times are ,
Bro019_1225	2	Or anything . ; No ; the just the same same way we 're using I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . ; Phones .
Bmr007_1094	b	So . ; I still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds , ; at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1144	%--	yeah . ; So if you do have lots of combinations , it 's ; But it 's it 's it 's not so long . ; It @ @
Bed005_1347	s	I mean , th the first , they had to make a design question , " do we take ontologies that have instances ? ; or just one that does not , that just has the types ? " ; OK . ; And , so , since the d decision was on types , on a d simply type - based , we now have to hook it up to instances .
Bns003_628	bs	but it 's ou outside of ICSI . ; Mmm . ; So , ; KPN and and ICSI in principle .
Bro022_985	aa	using some kind of filter , ; or ; Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . ; Yeah .
Btr002_494	b	because they 're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Buw001_1205	g	but it can't be , yeah , very deep . ; u I I actually think that that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , uh , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know . ; I mean , ye ; Right ?
Bro013_565	%--	Mmm . ; Or or uh ; um ; there 's uh
Bmr023_317	s	OK . So , um , we Uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what I 'm calling " set one " , ; which was the s the set that I 've been , uh OK , talking about up to this point , ; but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . ; Right now they 're in the process of being edited .
Bmr027_979	bk	Yeah . They 're they 're not in the segmented . ; It 's not that the IBM people didn't do it . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr003_1896	co	If you just did a crappy job , no nobody would want you to do it . ; I sh I shouldn't be allowed to by m by my own by my according to my own priorities . ; Alright . ; Let 's look at it anyway .
Bro014_148	s	but I can I can send email around about it . ; Yeah . ; And so we 've got it ; now HTK 's compiled for both the Linux and for , um , the Sparcs .
Bdb001_1001	s	Most of the tools can handle that . ; So that ; Yeah . ; we didn't do it at the API - level .
Bro003_1732	t3	Uh , ; that 's a good thing you remove the mike . ; Go ahead , ; good .
Bed014_1322	b	Mm - hmm . Sure . ; I mean , it 's gonna be plenty hard for for people to understand it as it is , ; but y y you don't want to make it worse . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_664	%--	But you ; Yeah . ; So . ; You know , you shouldn't be more than
Bns001_514	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I c I didn't find the time , yeah , to do so , ; OK .
Bmr024_531	%	And , uh , it involves starting I believe starting with a ; It 's it 's always the wizard , ; but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , speech generation system . ; Yeah .
Bmr028_425	b	And it demonstrates why it doesn't work , ; because you really wanna go acro more than one meeting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1270	b	Uh , d we were just ; Who are you talking about , ; Bush or Don ? ; Yeah .
Bmr013_1035	s	Right . ; aren't they ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I thought they were .
Bro014_1448	cc	Uh , ; or ? ; not yet ; but I wi I will call them
Bed005_908	s	So , what happened is , ; there 's this , eh , uh ; Robert was describing ; the There 's two packages
Bro023_1108	b	th the just noise compensation technique is a variant of Wiener filtering , ; plus they do some some smoothing techniques on the final filter . ; The th they actually do the filtering in the time domain . ; Mmm .
Bro027_621	b	uh then then it could go in parallel . ; Cuz i ; And then y then you don't have that additive ; Yep .
Bmr022_227	%--	Oh . ; Well ; But ; Uh , OK , yeah . So the only
Bsr001_1080	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro003_985	s	Yeah , ; so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training ? ; I mean , it 's not totally crazy ; t I mean , these are a lot of these are built - in things
Bro025_115	s	you know , ; Oh . ; figure it out . ; I mean , and th the joke there was that each of them had specialized in one of them .
Bmr024_193	s	So . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And we wanted to avoid doing that ,
Bmr029_546	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh , I I think also for the log spectral mean subtraction , uh , we wanna know which speaker 's talking when , ; Yeah .
Bro004_338	bk	For the PLP with JRASTA the the we ; This is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate , uh if we go to to TIMIT . ; And then it 's it gets worse with the multilingual . ; Um . Yeah .
Bmr030_694	s	Oh yeah , I don't know . ; The demo ? ; Something about ; The demo was one of them .
Bmr016_119	s	since then you 'll have just more digit data , ; Right . ; and that 's always a good thing . ; It 's a little bit better for me too
Bro005_329	s	Mm - hmm . ; Um ; But w ; The other ones , we 'd have to look at it ,
Bmr003_2388	s	It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and and look in the thing every so often , ; Yeah . ; but just have the ; And given given that we 've got a wireless that we 've got a we got the field .
Btr001_316	%--	Maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish woman , ; I don't know if I have . ; I suspect you haven't ; because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of
Bmr003_360	ba	Yep . ; Yeah . ; High pitch hum . ; Wow .
Buw001_528	2	I mean , that happens in most meetings . ; I I I think that , um , there 's we 're using " summary " in two different ways . ; So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " . ; Minutes .
Bmr008_1737	b	too . ; Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ? ; I 'm not sure . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1269	qrr	And the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings , ; and that 's prepended with a no non - vocalization . ; So then it just an ending curly brace there , ; or is there something else in there .
Bmr003_1594	s	OK . ; then I indicated it as a segment which contained @ @ this utterance plus an overlap . ; OK . ; But that 's but there 's only one there 's only one time boundary for both speakers ,
Bns002_111	b	That 's O K . ; OK . ; That 's perfect , you know . ; Yeah .
Bro012_836	%--	Uh . ; Well , I mean , because everything uh If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances . ; Yeah . ; So if there 's an overall reason
Bed013_406	s	So we can actually show how we parse it . ; That should be able to we should be able to come up with , you know , a sort of a a parse . ; Right . ; It 's on ,
Bro010_1190	s	Uh , that 's not a practical thing , ; uh , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , ; but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline . ; Uh , it still won't be perfect because there 's noise .
Bro028_502	s	Um , one is their software ; their , uh , LVCSR system . ; Downloaded the latest version of that . ; Got it compiled and everything .
Bmr015_714	2	some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be Stephane . ; Yeah . ; I talked with Stephane and and Thilo ; Yeah and and Thilo ,
Btr002_2293	s	Hmm . ; Which is a very it 's that 's how I tended before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription , how I tended to look all conversations , ; That 's right . ; and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way .
Bro012_419	b	I mean ; but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . ; Oh . Oh , I see . ; Yeah .
Bns003_146	%	Huh . ; Not a no FTP . ; Yeah , FTP yes . ; H
Bro028_203	bk	you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there . ; So you make use of both of them in in what you 're ending up with . ; Maybe it 's better . ; Yeah .
Bed003_894	no	Let 's see . ; right ? ; Yeah , ; I don't know if JavaBayes is nice about that .
Bmr009_688	s	isn't it ? ; in this small ; I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing . ; Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window .
Bmr009_1221	s	because if you don't know , then , you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally inept or something , ; Good . ; Hmm . ; if somebody doesn't know , it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of midwest standard .
Bro023_1272	aa	but I would imagine it would help some . ; Mm - hmm . ; So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system . ; Yeah ,
Bro027_1249	s	Say , for the I mean , it ; No , it doesn't . ; No . ; So it 's only the highly mismatched ?
Bed011_1039	%--	and it you know it 's it 's sort of like anything goes . ; Like ; OK , so this is I think we 're gonna mainly work on with George . ; OK , and hi
Bmr018_635	b	or , uh , I extracted it incorrectly , ; But ; it was labeled ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_953	aa	That could be . ; So , don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate ? ; That could be . ; Yes .
Bmr022_431	s	Could could be helpful . ; I i ; Yeah , you don't have to ; you could keep them short by not s or just go one through ten , one through ten , one through ten , or one through twenty .
Bmr011_738	%--	Well I can't , ; Can I verbally consent ? ; I 'm wired in . ; We we we we don't , uh
Bro004_922	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Uh . the software currently just has uh a allows for I think , the one one hot output . ; So you 're having multiple nets and combining them , ; or ?
Bmr023_352	%--	So . ; And this way it 'll I mean , I got really a lot of response for for my notice ; and I think I could hire additional people if I wish to . ; Yeah . An - and the other thing is , I mean , in the unlikely event
Bed006_230	cc	Maybe . ; OK . ; I don't remember getting anything . ; W we 'll see .
Bed005_695	s	Mmm . ; So , at least unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise I think the general domain we don't have t to uh , broaden . ; That is , tourists in Heidelberg . ; And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure .
Bro010_612	b	I mean , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , um , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , ; not at the end . ; So ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_913	%--	How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ? ; How many ? ; Eh , not @ @ I ; Onl - only I I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the
Bmr024_1555	bk	How many are you shooting for ? ; There 're five now . ; It can hold eight . ; Oh , OK .
Bmr013_747	s	So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then
Btr002_1566	b	That 's right . ; if there was those tarts again , I 'd be like , " Set us some aside some there . " ; Ooh , those were good . ; Hmm .
Bmr014_710	%--	where 's the where 's the release ? " ; And then there 'll be a subset of people , ; right ? ; OK there 's
Bmr016_915	b	So ; Yeah . ; and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2430	%--	Oh , I see . ; I just make a mouth ; Huh . ; Cuz I think I had talked to you about this about
Bro014_853	%--	We have here some histogram , ; but they have a lot of overlap . ; E yeah , ; but it 's it 's still
Bed006_1004	s	And um we started thinking about going through our bakery questions , ; so when I say " is there a bakery here ? " ; you know I do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all f tell the rest of the system " hey this person actually wants to go there " ; and " B " , that person actually wants to buy something to eat there .
Bmr002_1325	s	but just indicate if th if there 's a prominent word , to indicate it . ; Sure . ; Yeah , that 's great . ; All caps .
Bmr003_2067	bk	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; let let the record show that this is exhibit two B . ; That 's right .
Bro012_1438	b	Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing . ; But that was speaker - dependent actually . ; We were doing training on a particular announcer ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_931	s	Well I th I think so . ; It 'd be really foolish to do otherwise . ; Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . ; I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files .
Bmr024_216	s	It 's good ; About IBM stuff ? ; Uh , Brian I I sent bresset sent Brian a message about the meeting ; and I haven't heard back yet .
Bed016_561	s	but cover only base cases . ; And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . ; And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , ; that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors
Bro016_47	cc	Like for the well - matched case , it seemed like it was pretty good . ; Um . I could do more playing with that , though . ; And , uh ; and see .
Bmr027_408	s	Yeah , but w Mmm . ; Because ; what I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . ; No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with .
Bro003_531	bk	Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked . ; It was automatically first , and then hand hand - corrected . ; But but , um , uh , it it , um , it might be a better source . ; Oh , OK .
Bed006_1373	aa	OK . ; OK . ; Well uh it 's it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on , and would be interesting . ; Yeah .
Bro011_80	b	uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . ; Yeah . ; Uh . Um . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_528	s	Mmm . ; Yeah . ; One ; Or in some cases , it 's it 's quite definitely
Bmr001_300	bk	and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table . ; Mm - hmm . ; Well . ; Yep , yep .
Bro027_256	s	There were two things , uh , that they had to download . ; One was the , uh , I guess the software . ; And another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . ; So I downloaded the software and compiled all of that .
Bmr005_384	s	Oh . ; Yeah . ; I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . ; This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together .
Bmr006_1535	bk	Yeah . ; OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have " Roger " be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was " Roger " be " Frank " , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . ; Oh . ; Ugh !
Bns003_867	b	So it 's very It 's static ? ; It 's No , active ? ; But it 's sort of active because they have these program statements . ; Yeah .
Bed017_388	s	One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document , ; and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , ; well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of of the of the units . ; Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy ,
Bed015_2124	s	and you throw it away . ; And the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . ; You may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes . ; But it 's in that respect it 's completely scalable .
Bro004_973	aa	And then uh , just to remind me , all of that goes into uh , that all of that is transformed by uh , uh , K - KL or something , or ? ; There will probably be , ; Mu . ; yeah ,
Bro019_730	s	The the well - matched is like ; the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing . ; Yeah . ; Well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched .
Bmr001_581	aa	Oh yeah ! ; Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah , that 's right .
Bmr025_413	%--	I mean it works with Transcriber ; but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools ; uh because it doesn't mark start and end . ; Start and end of each ?
Bmr019_1489	s	Yeah . ; You know , that 's that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation stuff . ; Yeah . ; I will send you the the final version ,
Bmr003_450	s	So it 's that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . ; But . ; So we can get that just with , uh , media costs , ; Still a point .
Bed014_1414	bk	So Friday , ; Monday ; Yeah . ; Monday .
Bmr016_2010	%--	Yep . ; Now why do we what 's the reason for having like the point five have the " NUMS " on it ? ; Is that just like when they 're talking about their data or something ? ; This is more because
Bro007_28	s	The graph , ; yeah another one . ; Yeah , that 's good . ; So we have these features from OGI that goes through the three paths .
Bro019_944	s	maybe we ; well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , ; and they have implementation of VTS techniques ; so it 's um , Vector Taylor Series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra .
Bed014_551	s	And then the we had another idea floating around um , which we wanted to , uh , get your input on , ; and that concerns the ; But the nice thing is w we would have a person that would like to work on it , ; and that 's Ir - Irina Gurevich from EML who is going to be visiting us , uh , the week before , uh , August
Bro019_688	%	Uh , no , ; I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro008_479	%--	Yeah , ; so d ; well ; Actually , this is tha that 's why we
Bro014_328	%--	and then do the ; Combine error rates ; Yeah . ; and then
Bro019_489	s	No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update . ; Ye ; Yeah , ; and I I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm .
Bro024_134	s	Yeah , ; um . ; But but , uh , ; as you say , there hasn't been that much with this long long - time , uh , spectra work .
Bns001_1060	s	No . ; So that 's maybe the reason . ; Not me . ; And I 'm not I doubt that it 's not available in Germany .
Bmr005_302	x	It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK . ; Uh , I think ; Well , the inference structures was Lokendra . ; But no . The inference stuff was was was Lokendra .
Bro021_1135	s	And the the model of clean speech is a codebook . Right ? ; u ; Yeah . ; We have our codebook with different density Gaussian .
Bed013_1401	b	but , you know , just not really ; OK , I 'm eja exaggerating , ; but that might be , you know , saying " hey " , you know , some stuff is is actually complex , if you look at it in in in the vacuum ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr018_1323	b	So . ; Mm - hmm ; and that they 've found that 's just not a big deal . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_374	bk	except the ones who ; I mean , we we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups . ; Mmm . ; OK .
Bed011_164	s	we get to the uh uh belief - net just focusing on on the g Go - there node . ; uh Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth . ; Mm - hmm . ; And what w what happened is that um design - wise I 'd sort of n noticed that we can we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes .
Bro019_148	s	Exactly . ; Yeah , you know , I I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently ; and uh , ; uh I fired off a training job ,
Bmr006_413	s	Yeah . ; So . ; They they originally They 've decided not to do go into speech . ; So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer ,
Bmr025_313	g	so uh ; Um ; My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . ; Right ?
Bmr029_127	bk	right ? ; Or will we run into trouble when we g ? ; Well , the males account for most of this meeting data anyhow . ; Yeah .
Bro012_47	s	um if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP um then uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which um allows you to do high - pass filtering ; and in general we like to do that , because of things like this ; and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe ; filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies ,
Bro010_792	%--	OK . ; Um , ; OK , ; if we 're we 're done done with that ,
Bmr003_2476	b	Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way ; Yeah . ; and and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1450	%--	Mm - hmm . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; So this
Bmr022_658	%--	That 's why you actually need the text . ; In order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against . ; So ; It 's just an idea , if if it turns out that
Bro023_444	s	uh , this is the single stage Wiener filter , ; with The noise estimation was based on first ten frames . ; Mm - hmm . ; Actually I started with using the VAD to estimate the noise
Bro021_337	s	Um , ; he had the France Telecom blind equalization in the system . ; Um , ; the number o of MFCC that was were used was different .
Bed011_718	%--	Um . ; Put it in . ; Bicycles c should be in there , ; but ,
Bro024_1713	%--	Yeah . ; then you have a bad signal - to - noise ratio and then you you would like to have a stronger smoothing . ; Mm - hmm . ; So you could you could base it on your estimation of the signal - to - noise ratio on your actual
Bed011_53	s	Then we need to figure out what influences its choices ; and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . ; But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . ; Technical stuff we 'll do uh another day .
Bro017_335	s	You need some relative , relative relation . ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing .
Bmr018_1070	b	Use those for adaptation , ; cuz if you if you use everything , then you get all the cross - talk in the adaptation , and it 's just sort of blurred . ; That 's a good point . ; Yep .
Bed002_926	s	She 's graduated . ; She is a graduate , OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly .
Buw001_1950	s	smart rooms , ; Um , the " Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand " is a good one . ; um ; CMU ,
Bro008_531	%--	yeah . ; Yeah . ; Also , uh , I mean , there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data . ; So one form of different data was is from different languages , but the other
Bmr014_928	s	And then if they don't , you 're done . ; If they do , then he provides them access to the the web site . ; W w ; Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords .
Bro003_1095	s	so . ; Uh . ; Right ? ; I mean , it 's just running the data through
Btr002_1588	%--	but . ; And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , ; and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever , ; or
Bmr028_1340	aa	It really is ; It is . Yep . ; and it it 's sort of , um Because it 's so strong a word , people don't take it that seriously , ; Yeah .
Bro026_743	s	Oh , OK . ; Oh , OK . ; Yeah . ; It 's just a HMM , Gaussian mixture model .
Bro010_163	s	Um , ; But , well , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright . ; We would be at six ; so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling ,
Bro019_1577	bk	So , um , ; f for the I 'm using an eighth - order polynomial ; and I 'll get three or four of these pairs ; Yeah .
Bro014_1466	b	w ; Hmm . ; Hmm . ; OK .
Bmr010_1014	s	Didn't bother ; I knew it when I said it . ; I remember s thinking " oh , that 's not correctly pronounced " . ; But it but I thought it 's not worth fixing
Bed006_545	s	I was like " OK , ; We 're done . ; we 're done ! " ; So that was like one of the first l You know , the first task was getting it working for English .
Bns002_26	aa	No . ; So . ; It works like like this . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr019_159	%--	Yeah . ; Um . ; A a a couple percent or some ; I mean
Bro013_247	b	I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_663	bk	I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet . ; OK . ; I should 've sent email and I haven't yet . ; Yeah , right .
Bed006_1789	s	maybe maybe you 're gonna run a trial tomorrow . ; I mean , I 'm just wondering whether the ac some the actual sentences from this domain will be available . ; Cuz it 'd be nice for me to like look if I 'm thinking about examples ; I 'm mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting .
Bmr006_1371	b	Yeah . ; That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1441	bk	Mm - hmm . ; So it 's just ; Oh , that we could . ; OK .
Bmr010_1291	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I I think we have to start ; Yeah .
Bed017_729	%--	Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , ; Uh - huh . ; but , uh , ; you know , a again , if if you if you
Bmr013_1002	qw	Yep . Yep . ; Yeah . ; And they 're gonna do the wiring for us . ; What 's the , um , style of the headset ?
Bmr014_582	s	The channel u thing ? ; Yeah . ; Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer uh , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels ; and , it 's just in uh in this new multi - channel format and output ,
Bmr013_626	b	And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , ; and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , ; and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , um , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , ; OK .
Bmr007_1196	no	so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is is h putting the beep over it . ; Yeah , you can either beep or it can be silence . ; OK . ; I I couldn't decide . which was the right way to do it .
Btr001_2655	bk	OK . ; OK . ; So , I have a question . ; Yeah .
Bro008_105	b	And here the the worst system still reduced the error rate by thirty - three percent , or something , in development set . ; Oh , wow . ; So so , you know , sort of everybody is doing things between , well , roughly a third of the errors , and half the errors being eliminated , uh , and varying on different test sets and so forth . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_772	s	I don't know . ; That 's kind of interesting . ; Usually it 's not ; usually that doesn't happen
Bro027_1465	b	So you wouldn't necessarily then want to do LDA on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that ; That i i ; I think that 's counter to that idea . ; Yeah ,
Bed003_1391	s	the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen ; so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing ; but um um we can sort of ; It has a very clear interface .
Bmr012_225	%	so ; Oh . ; yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , ; That 's not good .
Bro016_423	b	OK . ; And that you figure on actually finishing it in in June . ; Because , you know , you 're gonna have another bunch of results to fit in there anyway . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_413	s	I mean on the the , you 're that 's see , that 's you . ; Oh , that 's great , that 's great . ; Yeah . ; I 'm glad to see propagation .
Bro005_570	2	Uh . ; Yeah , you have to change the ; No , you can just do it in as once you 've done the training ; And then you can vary it .
Bro003_1410	cc	and h they he say me that h he does doesn't any any s any form to to do that . ; And at the end , I think that with LabeCut I can transfer to ASCII format , ; and HTK is an ASCII format . ; And I m do another , uh , one program to put ASCII format of HTK to ase ay ac ASCII format to Exceed
Bmr005_1140	s	and also a a c a complete inversion , ; if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . ; Um , that 's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , ; and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and and uh goes to infinity .
Bsr001_1735	b	tens of hours of data , I think . ; M ; Tens of hours . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1547	s	Ah . ; Right . ; and then get rid of the parentheses . ; But the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts , of of noti noticing that there 's something uncertain .
Bmr015_46	bk	I have no idea ; but I just got it a few minutes ago . ; Oh . ; Oh .
Buw001_1709	s	Well ; Ah , yeah . ; So . ; It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed .
Bro011_622	x	and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . ; Wow . ; Lots of silence . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bro017_216	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique , ; you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT , add constant , ; Hmm .
Bmr021_120	s	because we can just go out and buy them . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired .
Bmr008_873	b	but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place ; and that therefore they 're ; I mean , nowadays hardly anybody from California has a native Californian accent , ; Right .
Bmr011_578	s	and they 'll be ; You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go ; since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , ; um , and just have this other information available .
Bsr001_2415	ba	Yeah , that 's a good idea . ; Funny . ; Hmm . ; That 's a good idea .
Bed014_1233	s	that that the logicians have have , uh ; That 's right . ; come up with this ; It makes sense from that point of view , too , which is actually better .
Bmr015_665	s	Cuz there are large s spaces of the ; That 's a good point . ; There are large spaces where there 's no overlap at all . ; Someone 's giving a presentation ,
Bro003_353	%--	It could be , ; but that 's the image they have , ; right ? ; So that 's that 's
Bmr029_860	co	So , do we need to wait to find out who he 's gonna throw out , ; so that we create a new set of short models that don't include those speakers ? ; Uh ; Say this again ?
Bed015_2010	s	Inherits . ; So um , ; OK . ; my argument is there 's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more constructions .
Bro003_265	bk	Yeah . ; Well , actually , for the moment if we w do not want to use these phone databases , we we already have uh English , Spanish and French uh , with microphone speech . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro017_1074	b	right ? ; so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed008_630	d	So why is it ; oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? ; Yea - n is that ; Like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ?
Bmr002_215	bk	which may be different than wearing it on the head . ; OK . ; So , basically they 're kind of like sentences but with n numbers instead of words . ; OK .
Bro003_1097	s	Right ? ; I mean , it 's just running the data through ; Oh . ; Well , you gotta do the KL transformation ,
Bro012_1394	s	But you could I mean you can you can align so that It 's not perfect , ; but if you if you know what was said ; and ; But the problem is that their models are all word level models .
Bmr002_334	bk	Yeah . ; But um e you know , the I mean , there are always ways of doing things more efficiently or more uh in a more technical technically sophisticated way ? ; And , ; Yeah .
Bmr006_726	ba	And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the ; Yeah . That 's interesting .
Bed006_114	bk	Wizard . ; Wizardess . ; Sorceress , I think . ; OK .
Bmr010_923	b	Yeah . ; We also tried , um , absorbing these uh , both laughter and and actually also noise , ; and , um ; Yeah .
Bmr016_333	s	No , I 'm serious , ; so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation , ; Yeah . ; Yeah all we have for some people is digits .
Bed010_537	s	but this is a a three language project : German , English , Japanese . ; OK . ; And um , we have a uh , uh I have taken care that we have the the Japanese generation and stuff . ; And so I looked into uh spatial description .
Bns001_1384	s	nothing nothing that great , ; Completely useless ! ; but it has some some possibility of being expanded . ; But the point is eh , the only in here The only thing wireless thing I can put on on this is just uh this Omnisky modem ,
Bmr002_744	b	OK ? ; Right . ; " Specification of uh Coding workbench " , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_1024	bk	OK . So , first of all is , ; uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? ; JavaBayes or something ? ; Oh .
Btr002_3093	%	Yeah . ; That 's OK . ; Remember that ? ; Oh , you have ?
Bmr008_222	%--	It 's possible . ; Like , if you have a PHD and you 're hanging around here , and you 're not a professor and you 're not a post - doc , then that 's like what we are so There 's a bunch of people like that . ; Someone who has a PHD . ; Yeah so for for me there 's there 's a There are people
Bmr013_685	bk	M ; but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . ; I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . ; Yeah .
Bed014_167	s	but we have to ask . ; Oh , so this was You know , on the generation thing , ; um ; if sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well .
Bns002_624	b	because for example , uh one kind of thing , ; OK , if I use a directional antenna , this is making that in one direction , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_509	s	On the blackboard , that is . ; Of course , in real life there will b probably be some problems . ; Have you have you read about this uh Barwan project held at Berkeley University ? ; Well , what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday .
Bro013_38	g	Yeah . ; so , well ; Probably . ; Huh ?
Bed008_27	b	Is your mike on ? ; Ah . ; Oh right , well . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1150	fa	I sent You know that one ? ; so ; The which one ? ; I 'm sorry .
Bro007_54	aa	That 's it . ; Um . So this is ; OK so that 's that 's this bottom one . ; yeah
Bed002_429	s	And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it . ; s b ; So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue . ; So if someone says something you could ask them .
Bdb001_706	s	but I 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting . ; So , you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one level up , ; one to the sent ; So so what you would end up having is a tag saying " here 's a word ,
Btr001_853	s	Mm - hmm . ; You 're ; i it 's h ; On purpose , though .
Bed005_1439	%--	But suppose you want it embedded ? ; Well , then you 'd have to break all of your Bayes - nets into smaller Bayes - nets , ; with all the ; Oh , that
Bmr019_747	%--	So there 's some things there , ; especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the ; Well , the ; I I think you can do better by uh , cloning
Bro019_1409	s	So , that 's that 's just generally what I 've been looking at . ; Yeah . ; Um , ; By by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at .
Bro003_345	aap	Yeah , ; if ; Yeah . ; If it 's th in the phone ,
Bmr020_1519	s	Yeah . ; right ? ; Yeah . ; Uh , and so so so it was almost it was almost always doing the right thing .
Bsr001_2298	ba	Just , uh . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . ; That 's a good idea .
Buw001_1193	aa	That 's not a lot of time , ; That 's that . ; but ; Yeah .
Bmr030_179	no	No . I didn't have any problems ; I 'm sorry ? ; How much memory does he have ? ; I don't know ,
Bro024_1148	g	Well , in in the system we want to add like speech frame before every word and a little bit of of , uh , s a couple of frames after also . ; Uh , but to estimate the performance of the VAD , we don't want to do that , ; because it would artificially increase the um the false alarm rate of speech detection . ; Right ?
Bed015_1929	s	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; So that that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer
Bed005_788	s	the de g uh , small ; Something , uh , maybe we should address one of these days , is to That most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements , ; and and analyze those . ; Whether it 's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this .
Bro026_852	s	Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . ; And , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data . ; And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are . ; And you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related .
Bmr019_752	s	And you and what we wanted to try with you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , uh , t cloning that reject model ; and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground , ; like fragments and stuff , ; and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker .
Btr002_2017	s	Mmm . ; OK . ; Yeah . ; In a way they 're more fun , though .
Bed012_822	ba	Oh , in my name ? ; Yeah . ; Before the A . ; OK , good .
Bmr009_348	%--	starting with something that you can see eh you know without the extra layers of ; Right . ; Cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like ; I don't think this is true , but what if
Bmr024_802	s	Right . ; So ; Hmm . ; Heidelberg
Bmr006_344	b	Mm - hmm . ; And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal ; Right . So that ; Yeah .
Btr001_921	b	Or not . ; I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi ; Well , I 've ; Mm - hmm ,
Bmr023_408	s	Hmm . ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; you know , I mean , you 're You 're aware of this .
Bro016_667	s	although , you frequently get less distinct higher formants , it 's still third formant 's kind of a reasonable compromise , ; and ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I think , eh , if I recall correctly , they did something like that .
Bro028_467	s	Yeah . ; Mmm . Evi ; But , I mean , other than that , I don't think it 's ; I mean , other than the pitch de information , it 's hard to imagine that there 's a whole lot more in the signal that that , uh that we 're throwing away that 's important .
Btr002_2032	aa	And to breathe . ; Yeah . ; or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . ; Right .
Bed010_488	bk	That 's important , yeah . ; So he 'll get you some data . ; Yeah , ; u OK .
Bro014_1127	bk	Yeah . ; which is for voiced sound ideally ; a a pulse train ; Uh - huh .
Bro019_296	aa	Yeah , yeah . ; and you probably go , " screw this " , ; and You know . ; Yeah .
Bed006_988	ar	And if so like can are you able to enforce that you know if if it 's if it 's SPG action then you have that schema , ; if it 's a forced motion then you have the other schema present in the ; Um we have absolute ; No .
Bro012_575	%--	Is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ? ; Yeah . ; Well . For the moment they 're ; uh everybody 's quite
Bmr016_1946	s	but in any case , um , " numbers " and " NUMS " are a part of this digits task thing . ; Um , now th Then I have these numbers that have quotation marks around them . ; Um , I didn't want to put them in as gloss comments ; because then you get the substitution .
Bro021_1101	b	And this is ; And that 's where it comes from . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Right .
Bed016_991	b	So , ; You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so , ; Hmm . ; www .
Bro014_239	%--	it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . ; Right now it 's a weighting on on improvement . ; Mm - hmm . ; Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on
Bro027_43	b	Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at OGI . ; Um , ; but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . ; Yep .
Buw001_1190	s	Sounds ; OK . ; h Thanks , bye . ; That 's not a lot of time ,
Bmr022_554	s	but not any real human not a lot of human work . ; Right . I mean , that 's what we want to avoid . ; I mean if in terms of the alignment , actually , all we would need is we wouldn't even need words . ; We would need a general speech model and a beep model .
Bed004_783	%--	N ; I mean , we have to ; " how do I get to X " . ; Then we also have the " what 's this ? " domain , where we get some slightly different
Bmr015_348	s	That they didn't reject a lot of the pre - proposals ? ; Do you know anything about the numbers ? ; No . ; It 's just from his message it sounded like that .
Bmr016_960	b	and all the non - native speakers , ; and all the men , and all the women . ; and it 's ; Yeah .
Bmr016_1359	s	Actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person , ; It 's the Castle of Ah ! ; Uh , it looks like that . ; she 's like , " I don't know what that is either " .
Bmr016_962	%--	and it 's ; Yeah . ; That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time , ; find the time boundaries and
Bmr010_794	s	Yeah . ; And then there 's mass . ; Mm - hmm . ; Anyway .
Bmr015_169	%	because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits . ; Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh , I just wanted people to , take a quick look at the instructions ; Eight eight two two two nine .
Bro016_360	s	Uh , to try to found , nnn , robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice . ; And we w we try to use the variance of the es difference between the FFT spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum . ; Yeah . ; Uh , also the another parameter is relates with the auto - correlation function .
Bed003_1768	s	in the course of the task ? ; Well not all of them ; but you know . ; Bu - e e e I 'm even This this Tango , Enter , Vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario .
Bmr016_1576	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . I agree . ; It 's not so bad . ; Right .
Bmr024_822	s	Uh ; Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ? ; Those were non - backed - up . ; Non - back - up .
Bsr001_1188	aa	Hmm . ; Feedback . ; I mean ; Yeah .
Bro019_162	bk	So . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr010_1514	s	So , ; th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things ; Hmm . ; and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator .
Bed008_585	b	I think you have to be in move mode before ; Uh - huh . ; OK . ; Good .
Bns001_1142	s	And especially UMTS . ; If they want to get back the money . ; So is it maybe a research topic to focus on the ; not really billing , of course .
Bmr027_871	ba	Yeah . ; I don't see there 's a problem . ; Right . ; It 's very nice .
Bed016_554	bk	but it doesn't say it doesn't it d it d ; Why . ; yeah , it doesn't give the punch line . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed015_708	s	OK . ; Anyway , ; right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b ; you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess
Bro022_278	b	O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . ; So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ? ; Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed016_325	%--	Uh . ; Whatever . ; OK . ; Um , and that 's
Bmr008_1467	x	of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them ; because different sounds are different loudnesses . ; So I mean , what if you took uh one second chunks or something like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_995	%--	that there 's one third thing I wanted to to ex raise as a to as an issue ; which is , um , how to handle breaths . ; So , I wanted to raise the question of whether people in speech recognition want to know where the breaths are . ; And the reason I ask the question is ,
Btr001_864	%	It 's not a great example , ; but you know ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Sh
Bro018_529	s	Uh , you could , ; but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh a translation to a per - frame feature vector , ; so there 's no sequence in that , ; I think .
Bmr027_1282	ar	Oh , so so , you mean the d the internal the disks on the machines that we just got ? ; Whew . ; Or we can move them . ; No .
Bro017_236	%--	Hmm . ; The TRAPS sound familiar , I but I don't ; Yeah ; I mean tha
Bns003_975	s	or maybe a new person could address this . in the future . ; So ; if ; I mean , wh what I think is that , uh , it it makes no sense to me to reduce , uh , uh , uh , uh , something which is more or less complete ,
Bro028_714	s	But the other thing we could do is also we could ; I mean , this this may not help us , uh , in the evaluation ; but it might help us in our understanding at least . ; We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties ,
Bro017_39	b	Right . ; And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " . ; Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either , ; Right .
Bed002_1055	s	yeah , @ @ . ; And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on . ; An - Nuh . ; But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete .
Bns001_384	qw	Right . ; Um . ; Well , the switching itself could be a problem . ; Why ?
Bmr025_414	h	but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools ; uh because it doesn't mark start and end . ; Start and end of each ? ; Uh
Bro018_350	s	Is that some kind of base conversion , ; I I have no idea . ; or ? ; Yeah , that 's what I was thinking ,
Bro013_291	s	Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh uh Middle America accents and ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US . ; it has has many people who sound in many different ways .
Bmr002_229	aa	Imagine that you 're reading a number phone number to someone . ; OK . ; Yeah ? ; Yep .
Bmr018_647	s	which which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for for it . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; And the grammar wasn't tuned either .
Bro028_1043	s	I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously ; some two - D ; and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . ; Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that .
Bro023_767	b	no . ; This is just to test whether we can really improve by using a better VAD . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_780	s	The ve level . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a we don't have ground truth for these .
Bmr015_412	s	that he got last year ? ; I don't I don't know . ; Yeah . ; I thought it was smaller ,
Bmr001_771	s	Oh , that would be interesting . ; So you don't @ @ noise . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough .
Bmr027_695	bk	Oh . ; Do you have to do the other close - talking ? ; as well as all of these . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_798	b	and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads ; and so that means synchronizing the time ; You know you want it pretty close ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_1053	s	uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis ; in which you which ; I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . ; So , you you you you pick the best feature .
Bed014_333	s	So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances ; and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , ; so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . ; But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems .
Bed014_158	b	Yeah . ; and ; You know ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_747	%--	So . ; Yeah . ; In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design , ; so it 's
Bmr013_320	b	And , yeah . ; " Gonna see you tomorrow " , uh , " guh see you tomorrow " . ; And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1090	s	It 'll probably be a little late , ; It is different . ; but I 'm gonna try it . ; In previous years , Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now ,
Bro019_916	s	It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite . ; So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise . ; So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering , ; first of the colo colored noise
Bmr010_995	qy	They got ; Uh - huh . ; Oh , no . ; Is that good or bad ?
Bro028_1123	s	But I I don't actually believe that argument ; because I know that , um , you can , uh ; computing features is useful , ; even though in principle you haven't added anything
Bed002_1294	s	So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , ; which nobody have has ; because car navigation systems don't really care . ; You know , they get you to the beginning of the street ,
Bmr021_615	s	Everybody will use it . ; Yeah . ; Fine slash U slash star . ; to change MR to MRM at all places at ICSI .
Bmr008_300	b	OK . ; No , I like the idea of putting down the the status information ; because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_259	%	Yeah . ; It 's it 's easy enough to try , ; just run it on ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_840	s	Yeah . ; Right . ; which you know , is just , probably random . ; Yeah , it was a small difference
Bns001_959	s	Could be , ; but ; I have a an important doubt about the IP availability over UMTS . ; I mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing
Bmr008_1276	s	and you got some response from from uh IBM about ; They haven't received them yet , ; but I did get a response from them saying " Yes we 're still alive , ; we haven't done anything yet . " basically .
Bed003_1469	s	Yeah ; but I don't know if it 's still ; They might have blown it up . ; Well it never went all the way ,
Bro024_919	aa	No . ; On - only to the log energy . ; Only ; Yeah .
Bns001_580	ar	Mm - hmm . ; Uh maybe a few comments . ; First of all , Um . Do you mind Mi - Miguel , to write the name of the project on the whiteboard ? ; Yeah .
Btr002_942	s	Yeah . ; or go too far , or something , ; Ni ; or I 'll be holding down " shift " because I wanna type something as a capital ,
Bns001_627	b	in the trunk of the car . Then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things ; and they are driving around the different areas . ; And the same car exists here in Palo Alto uh based on wireless LAN , GSM and 2 x Ricochet networks . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_82	s	Uh , no . ; OK . ; But yeah . ; Generally what you observe with TI - digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system .
Bro013_157	%--	it 's really pretty clean data . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . ; Now , some of it could be the fact that
Bmr005_1441	bk	I mean ; I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . ; Yeah . ; Oh .
Bmr009_1463	aa	Yes . ; It doesn't have to be ex all at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have . ; Yep , just which one . ; I think that 's fine .
Bmr002_1016	b	Right . ; but It must have been the LDC . ; I I I bet you anything . ; Yeah .
Bro014_445	s	um ; Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance this is back old on , uh on Italian uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched ; and eighteen for the medium - matched ; and sixty for the for highly - mismatched .
Bro003_533	aa	But but , um , uh , it it , um , it might be a better source . ; Oh , OK . ; So , i it 's ; you 're right .
Bed010_996	s	I suspect that 's right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I I may have to go to Switzerland for in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that .
Bmr028_1707	%--	Hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together , ; and
Bro028_136	qy	Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that , um ; Could ? Uh , uh , ; I 'm I 'm really sorry . ; Can you repeat what you were saying about the silence probability ?
Bmr028_64	b	Oh , good . That 's very good . OK . ; Yeah . So my my decision was , for the first pass for this demo that Liz was talking about I decided that I would do , um , only enough to get it working , as opposed to any coding . ; Mm - hmm . ; Right .
Bmr012_642	s	it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard ; so that 's good . ; And um let 's see ; there was one more thing I wanted to to mention
Bro024_1884	s	Yeah . ; OK . @ @ . ; Is that the reason ? ; And in your case it 's all all noisy ,
Buw001_1381	qy	But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that I mean , ; Mm - hmm . ; W ; does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ?
Bmr015_1071	s	they breathe all the time . ; And once in a while breath is communicative , ; but r very rarely . ; OK , so now , I had a discussion with Chuck about the data structure
Bed013_1056	s	so that we can say , OK we we always just look at this utterance . ; That 's the only utterance we can do , ; it 's hard coded , ; like Srini , sort of hand parsed ,
Bmr018_1290	2	Yep . ; and and , uh , um , so they they have their their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes , ; and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz ; And arrays ,
Bmr007_176	s	And it would be , you know of course , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and w what were they , ; and i and I and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , ; I mean , the general cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking , ; and and you know , I mean , w we know that an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that that that 's that 's viewed as being a culturally - relative thing ,
Bed008_339	bk	oh I see . ; If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bmr023_1270	%	i Anyone have a problem with saying zero ? ; No . ; Is zero OK ? ; Yeah .
Bmr007_370	s	What what I what I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too i too imprecise . ; But what I mean is that , um in Switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap . ; And what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap ; and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is that w uh at least , you know I 'm very interested in the scenario in which , uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible , and from a single microphone .
Bro017_504	qy	Well David told me ; David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm ; and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent ; he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines ?
Bmr002_338	co	Do you have to speak true English sentences when you do this ? ; Yeah , ; because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards ; and saying " Oh listen to her .
Bmr023_1179	s	Uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features . ; Oh , we already talked about that .
Bmr015_360	b	I should go back and look . ; I didn't I don't think that 's true . ; Yeah , OK . ; Mmm .
Bro026_614	co	Yeah , ; Yeah . ; yeah . ; Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this .
Bed005_89	ba	Mm - hmm . ; And if they don't If they say " no , I 'm not willing to sign that " , then we 'll show them the final transcript . ; But , um . ; Yep . Makes sense .
Bro023_919	b	Mm - hmm . ; Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated . ; And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , um , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated ; Mm - hmm .
Bro018_931	s	as I recall . ; So you can specify a different number of filters , and whatever um uh you specify , the last ones are gonna be ignored . ; So that that 's a way that you sort of change what the what the bandwidth is . ; Y you can't do it without I think changing the number of filters ,
Bro010_1005	aa	I don't remember that . ; Hmm . ; That would that 's ; you 're right ,
Bmr019_808	b	Yeah . ; but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there . ; And so the reject is also mapping and pauses ; Yeah .
Bro017_596	aa	Mm - hmm . ; So have you been running some new experiments ? ; I I thought I saw some jobs of yours running on some of the machine ; Yeah .
Bed015_721	%--	Yeah . ; I that 's fine . ; I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress . ; So , s
Bed008_31	%--	We were gonna do two things ; one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what ; That 's funny . ; and then as a uh separate but related task
Bro028_364	b	I ; Mm - hmm . ; but certainly the spectra are quite different . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro010_319	aa	or something like that . ; We t we talked about that . ; So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_736	b	No . ; We This is the output , sort of , of the natural language understanding , ; Oh , yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr012_492	s	Mm - hmm . ; so just for the heck of it I ran that ; And it said a hundred percent male ? ; um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .
Bmr015_198	b	I mean I 'm speaking for her since she 's not here . ; Yeah . ; But , um , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_200	s	So , tha that 's a month , ; which is fine . ; Twelve hours . ; Well , the only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth .
Buw001_1567	b	I mean , that 's realistically what people might well be remembering . ; So . ; So . ; Hmm .
Btr002_44	s	Alright . ; So . Uh , welcome back . ; Thank you for coming . ; Um , so , what I thought we 'd do today is pick up where we were last time
Bmr019_1780	bk	Great . ; Thank you , Jose . ; Thank you . ; Right .
Bmr028_860	ba	Right . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it it 's worth trying . ; But that 'd be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these .
Bmr007_589	aa	Yeah , I agree . ; But . ; I wonder what determines who gets the floor ? ; I agree .
Bmr022_1357	%--	Whereas we could say " other people " , you know , " these people are allowed to actually submit changes " . ; Right . ; I mean , I I think one thing that 's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know , we can say that for sure there 's no problems with any of the transcripts . ; I mean there 's ,
Bed002_1261	s	OK . ; S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . ; If if you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they ; You know , just pppt !
Bns001_918	s	But it Does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on , ; and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks ? ; Because Multicast you still mentio uh you mentioned that there is no potential . ; I think it 's described here that the potential , if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map Multicast
Bmr013_933	%--	Well n ; One question , ; e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? ; No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it ,
Btr002_2953	aa	I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of segments , which really aren't part of a word . ; Have you run across that where they 're they 're saying ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_1500	%--	That way there 's lots of work to do . ; So it 's ; Uh , ; anything to
Bro012_699	%--	Well that that that 's OK . ; But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again , ; Yeah . ; because you 're you 're you 're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out
Bmr016_1047	%--	I agree . ; Huh . ; Well we we have a problem with that , ; you know , time - wise on a
Bed011_307	s	Uh , because I don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet . ; I mean w we have tested this and a y ; have you heard listen to the f first two or th ; as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup .
Bed015_718	b	s some of this is just like my you know , by fiat . ; I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . ; I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it . ; Yeah .
Bns002_513	co	No . ; No . ; That 's ; Let me let me let me show you one thing .
Bmr002_1257	s	Mm - hmm . ; I don't know how large this is , actually . ; But I just was sort of thinking that um I 'm I 'm ; and it 's British
Bmr015_116	ba	but then but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore . ; I don't think that really matters ; because the conditions are so different . ; And that would be a little easier .
Bmr031_54	s	Oh well , never mind , ; it wasn't . ; There goes Chuck . ; Just kidding ,
Bmr023_813	s	um ; As I said before , the uh using Dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , um , @ @ I ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data ,
Bro018_473	s	The the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count ; and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM ; cuz that 'd be pretty simple ; because it 's just Say , if you had ten ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits ,
Bro028_29	s	No , this I 'm sorry , this is a conference call between different Aurora people ; Uh , yeah . It 's the conference call between the Aurora , uh , group . ; or just ? ; It 's the main conference call .
Bed015_462	s	Right . ; So there 's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say " in France , blah - blah - blah " , ; Mm - hmm . ; and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery ,
Bed013_310	s	I almost got into a brawl . ; But I did not finish the uh , ; But I 've been looking into it . ; I th @ @ It 's not like it 's a blank slate .
Bed015_1270	bk	No , no , no . ; I let 's see , I think we 're we 're not ; I don't think we have it quite right yet . ; OK .
Bro018_220	bk	Oh , OK . ; maybe for the other one . ; Yeah , voiced - unvoiced hopefully would be a lot better . ; OK .
Bmr025_490	b	Some fall out of ; Well it ; Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . ; Ooo .
Bmr027_812	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . ; and ; And it also doesn't give a a specific I didn't think of it .
Bmr029_800	bk	OK . ; And you need only the males . ; So . ; Oh , OK .
Bed004_852	s	Yeah , but they 're they 're easier for parsers . ; Right . ; Parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time . ; Because the mean the semantics are very complex in that .
Bed015_2163	s	and you try to come up with the , uh ; Except there 's no no theorem prover involved . ; Best explanation . ; No , there isn't a theorem prover
Bed015_993	b	uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . ; Mm - hmm . ; It doesn't always have to be the subject . ; Right .
Bmr008_236	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or what if there 's one more category that 's sort of general like that .
Bmr025_564	s	because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off ; and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . ; Huh . ; Um these these ones , they are much easier ,
Bmr012_966	s	The cross pads ? ; Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads . ; Cuz I was thinking you know if if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's a group that we don't know ; um and this came up talking to to Jerry also
Btr001_1604	b	I think I really , like , think of it in terms of re - transcribing it almost ; Yeah . ; and I only You know , b ; Hmm .
Bed006_707	qy	We 're talking more on the sort of intention level , up there , ; and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema , down there . ; Uh one question , Robert . ; When you point at the screen is it your shadow that I 'm supposed to look at ?
Bmr003_2038	s	Let 's see see what it does to the ; Clink ! ; But this was the uh just just to review , ; and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around .
Bro024_343	b	I I see . ; I was I was about to say . So if if you ask it " What what movies are on TV tonight ? " , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_788	aa	uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , ; not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . ; But then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live . ; Right .
Bro017_199	%--	So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective , ; right ? ; Right . ; Because you already uh had the noise uh in a
Bed014_653	b	Yeah . ; Uh , tal so I 'm talking about shopping ; and then you say , uh , you know , well , um " What 's it cost ? " or something . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1787	%	Thank you . ; Yeah . ; Keep in touch . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1476	b	And I will go definitely back to Germany the tenth of December . ; That is fixed now . ; And I hope we can use these remaining weeks to have really progress in uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before . ; Hmm - hmm .
Bed005_1103	%--	Mm - hmm . ; D and you got one , Robert . ; I don't know who else has seen it . ; There 's I mean
Bmr031_505	s	uh , if they ; Yep . Yep . ; They 'll have to start kicking people out of the meetings , ; Well , i w wa if if they 're going at forty - four , they won't even creep .
Bmr026_155	%--	It may not be as As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something . ; I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . ; He 's sort of been been volunteering for everything ; and and uh
Bmr003_2583	aa	We can start we you can make a hundred of them or something . ; Oh , of the of the boards ? ; Yeah , yeah , ; sure ,
Bmr030_757	%--	DD 's full . ; That was the first one . ; Or , that was the last one that w filled up , ; and DE still had like ,
Bmr011_1648	s	Yeah , I know you are . ; and and that that has a chance to give us some very interesting fun data . ; So ; if anyone has ideas ,
Bdb001_753	qrr	Right . ; I mean , that 's gonna be ; Is the rising pitch a feature , ; or is it gonna be in the same file ?
Btr001_1263	b	Which makes no sense to me . ; No it doesn't to me either ; Like " that 's not a syntactic part of that sentence " . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_12	s	Is that English ? ; That 's our system . ; Ugh ! ; and that it 's gone out to the transcribers
Bmr003_465	b	Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , ; so maybe we need to think about it a little bit . ; The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain . ; Huh .
Bmr007_992	%--	the candidate . ; I ; to make marking easier . ; Or
Bmr019_1263	x	um , she , um , i i i indicated that that you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis . ; Yeah . It 's it 's nice to know , ; Right . ; and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur .
Bmr029_64	b	I mean , it 's the non - overlap only . ; Um And ; it has to be enough to be sort of comparable to what you folks were seeing and what you reported already . ; Hmm .
Bmr013_279	b	Place . ; Thank you , what whatev whatever I s said , that 's ; OK . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_1087	ba	Ah . ; Just , kept ; Yeah . ; Wow .
Bdb001_333	%--	I mean , it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in , right ? ; OK . ; Yeah , ; th we have
Bmr002_1442	aa	Do you feel like a television star ? ; So you can charge more for it . ; That 's probably why I thought he was the chairman . ; Yeah , that 's it .
Bmr028_1582	s	Anyway , it 's colloquial , ; Anyway . ; an and and , uh , it 's it 's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sounds the way it sounds to you . ; But but , uh , I I 'd never heard that before .
Bed005_779	s	let 's say that by the end of spring break , I 'll try to come up with some general story about , um , construction grammar , ; and what constructions we 'd use ; and how all this might fit together . ; There 's this whole framework problem that I 'm feeling really uncomfortable about .
Bmr031_1342	%--	Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms , ; actually it 's it 's it 's not bad . ; You know ? ; So So it 's it 's you know , it 's like ,
Bed015_425	bk	I forgot again when ; you 're going away for how long ? ; Just , uh , as a sort of a mental bridge , I 'm not I 'm skipping fourth of July . ; OK .
Bmr012_666	aa	Yeah and ; well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , ; yeah . ; Seems reasonable .
Bro004_1021	s	Uh , no . I don't think so . ; Yeah , I have one . ; Oh , thanks . ; Ah ! OK . OK , we have lots of them .
Bro026_592	bk	Sure . ; and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak Joe about or whatever , ; because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff . ; OK .
Bed014_887	s	Um . ; Meeting regular meeting time for the summer , ; we really haven't found one . ; We did Thursdays one for a while .
Btr001_2362	aap	Oh , like kind of kind of laughing with it ; And ; Yeah . ; Kinda ,
Bed002_622	s	Uh , uh , yeah , or something . ; Machine , I mean . ; Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , ; but I don't think that 's gonna be the case .
Bmr023_752	bk	Yeah . ; Anyway , Don 's been doing a great job ; and we hope to continue with , um , Andreas 's help and also some of Thilo 's help on this , ; Great .
Bmr008_1422	s	OK . ; It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . ; So that 's why it doesn't add up down ; I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker .
Bmr020_770	bk	Yeah . ; She was saying it would be nice if they had eh the same set , ; so that when they did experiments they could compare . ; Right ,
Bed014_377	b	And if we if the formalism is is good , then we should be able to have , you know , sort of moderate scale thing . ; And that by the way is is , Keith , what I encouraged George to be talking with you about . ; Not the formalism yet ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr011_1592	s	Ooo , ooo . ; it was Swiss w ; Yeah , so it 's ; so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want , uh American English ,
Bmr005_1302	s	but I think if it 's a real ; Why not ? ; Yeah . ; I mean , I 'm thinking , politically
Bed015_162	s	But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ? ; Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for ; actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes . ; Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy .
Bmr022_281	aa	" high " , " low " is pretty straightforward , ; Great idea , ; yeah . ; yeah .
Bed009_994	b	So you 're going to that . ; Yeah , that that 's what we were planning to do . ; That 's good , because that will uh tell you a fair amount about The form of semantic construction grammar that we 're using . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_1759	2	Making some decisions ? ; i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um the audio , and just put in brackets " speaker - one " . ; Yeah . ; For the public one .
Bro018_801	bk	Well what I 've been ; " Changes to the data " , ; I 'm not sure I ; Right .
Bmr031_1048	qy	Yeah . Let 's get rid of them . ; So ; That 's a ; Well , has anybody done anything ?
Bro024_1065	b	That 's the way the the the frames are packed , ; like you have to wait for one more frame to pack . ; Because it 's the CRC is computed for two frames always . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_439	aa	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's gonna be too hard to do it without a ; Yeah ,
Bed008_85	2	How . ; Yeah ; Why , ; and so forth .
Bro024_1438	b	This , we have to ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro024_669	aa	And if it changes to point five point five , which is equal @ @ for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty - eight percent . ; Well , but that involves mucking with the back - end , ; which is not allowed . ; Yeah .
Bed016_140	s	I is there an extra copy around ? ; OK , we can we can we can pass pass my , uh we can pass my extra copy around . ; Uh . He sent it . ; OK . You can keep it .
Bmr006_1024	s	And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . ; OK . ; And Probably . I I I I would like to to t prove . ; Uh , probably . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC .
Bro005_1162	%--	uh , and uh , uh , channel characteristic , ; sort of all over the map . ; A bunch of different dimensions . ; And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have um , the data to train up
Bro017_154	b	So while you are right but uh you know but ; Uh yeah , ; if of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_910	qw	Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or ? ; More than ? ; More than ; How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?
Bro028_630	bk	You 're not on the mailing list or what ? ; Hmm - mm . ; The only , um , mail I get is from Mississippi State ; Uh - huh .
Bed009_663	ba	If if you know if if you can't make it happen then you you do your best . ; Yeah ; but that doesn't necessarily contradict um an architecture where there really is a pers a def well - defined interface . ; I totally agree .
Btr001_2491	bk	Like one time everybody was doing the , um , digits , ; and they were all doing it at the same time , ; and they started off kind of shaky , ; Oh , right .
Buw001_1285	%	But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , ; Mmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro025_700	s	In in my proposal , I I was thinking about starting from a set of , uh , phonological features , or a subset of them . ; Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John . ; Mm - hmm . ; He said , uh , um , these these phonological features are are sort of figments of imagination also .
Btr002_636	s	Yeah . Yeah , I do too . ; Yeah . ; Yeah ? ; And he was saying in the in the , uh , areas where you have clipping , where it 's recorded too high , and and it starts to saturate and you have trouble ,
Bro003_503	s	those were those were automatically derived by by Dan using , um , embedded embedded training and alignment . ; Mmm . ; Ah , but which Dan ? ; Uh , Ellis .
Bed010_714	s	So there 's there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and and so forth . ; Huh . ; Mm - hmm . ; So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts .
Bmr024_651	%--	OK . ; So should we save it ? ; And then ; Now th
Bed004_529	s	You approach . ; OK . ; Uh , and certainly you can add rules like that to the existing SmartKom system . ; And you just did ,
Bmr018_824	%--	Yeah . ; and I guess that 's the difference to me between like a real paper and a sort of , promissory paper . ; So , um , if we d ; it might be possible to take Thilo 's output
Bed013_1213	s	So un ; I change I changed my mind actually . ; OK . ; So I agree with that .
Bro025_646	s	Oh , OK . ; I see . ; Yeah . ; I thought that was only used for doing frame - dropping later on .
Bed016_1162	s	What color was this in in in the nain nineteenth century . ; Yeah . ; What was this p ; instead of wh what you know how was this painted ,
Btr001_2662	b	sometimes when people are reading " zero " , they say " O " , ; Yeah . ; Yes . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1466	b	And I 've been coordinating a little bit with Katrin at , uh , UW who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting . ; So there 's some overlap there in what you m ; there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration . ; Yeah .
Bmr014_530	s	Yes . ; More of an attempt to ; Yeah . ; I mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds ,
Btr002_787	bk	there 's no visual ; but ; Yeah , you have to the resolution , ; right ?
Bmr026_492	b	thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? ; So - so So maybe there 's a hundred gig or something . ; Or ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_549	%--	Um , I 'm ; You on Friday or S on Saturday ; Sunday ; or ?
Bro012_799	ba	Yeah . ; Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure , ; though it is not . ; Which is good .
Bmr029_360	s	I mean , in fact , we excluded them previously from ; Yeah . So we want to do the same same thing . ; Right . ; OK . So Alright . So if we got a list of the , uh , segmentations for these five Meeting Recorder meetings , we could start , uh , the first two experiments going right away , using the short male models .
Bmr003_864	s	S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much ; but anyway , enough to work with . ; Right . ; Several minutes .
Bmr031_703	s	Have to change servers , actually . ; Right ? ; Change servers ? ; Well , we could we could There are a bunch of disks that we have , uh , that are s s smaller .
Bed016_1163	qh	Yeah . ; What was this p ; instead of wh what you know how was this painted , ; what color was this painted ,
Bro025_394	co	So , the one one one difference is that was there is like we tried computing the delta and then doing the frame - dropping . ; S ; Mm - hmm . ; The earlier system was do the frame - dropping and then compute the delta on the
Bmr020_434	b	Mm - hmm . ; I 'm not looking forward to it . ; i it 's the high signal - to - noise ratio ; Right .
Bmr029_669	bk	So will you talk to him about that , ; or do you want me to talk to him ? ; I , uh , I I can talk to him . ; OK .
Bmr007_714	b	Well , you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the the seat number . ; And that could be ; Yeah Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_262	g	This is in the summer period ; and presumably people may be out of town . ; But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . ; Right ?
Bro004_449	%--	So , I mean wha what 's the ; So . ; This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for TI - digits , ; or ?
Bro028_77	%--	mmm ; Uh , yeah . So , the second thing is the system that we have currently . ; Oh , yes . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent improvement , ; but if you want to stick to the this latency
Bro024_261	ar	Or ? ; So do you have uh , you you mean you have files which are hours of hours long ? ; Or ? ; Oh , well , no .
Bro016_589	s	Hmm . ; Uh . ; Right . ; I mean , again , i if you had the whole system you were optimizing , that would be easy to see .
Bmr015_1186	s	I mean you can ; Yeah . ; you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well . ; The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart .
Bmr011_489	b	and it seemed like we had enough troubles just ; So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? ; No . So there 's there 's uh , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . ; Hmm .
Btr002_1971	s	and and Dan was adjusting something here ; and Adam was in the next room , ; and , um , Adam says , " So I 'll come in here and check the levels , " ; and and he says something
Bmr003_847	qrr	Take the data that you 've already transcribed ; Mm - hmm . ; and ; Is this already in the past or already in the future ?
Bmr003_1232	aa	or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ? ; Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved ; but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it . ; Yeah ,
Bmr003_1145	s	Content words only . ; We could have some telegraphic meetings . ; That might be interesting . ; Yeah , it 'd be cheap .
Bsr001_515	%	I 'm surviving . ; It depends , ; yeah I 've ; I think you have , you know , he would .
Bro014_1358	s	So , this is like yeah , fifty milliseconds or something like that . ; Fifty millis ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but it 's the same frame
Bmr027_922	%--	I agree with you . ; It 's we could do it , uh I I could I 'd be happy with either way , ; batch - wise ; What I was thinking
Bmr026_425	s	It 's ; But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there ; Yeah . ; and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are
Btr002_1290	b	Mm - hmm . ; and you have lots of different voices , ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_256	qh	What have I forgotten about ? ; Oh yeah , ; Well th uh ; how we do it ,
Bed015_368	%	did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic ; You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . ; So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed009_509	s	Yes . ; If the If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told ; OK ; th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .
Bdb001_197	s	I don't know if that ; I mean , we actually have ; So , one thing that Don is doing , is we 're we 're running For every frame , you get a pitch value , ; Lattices are big , too .
Bmr020_1522	s	Uh , and so so so it was almost it was almost always doing the right thing . ; Oh I see , ; the characteristics . ; So I wanted to get some sense of what what almost always meant .
Bro019_753	%--	Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m ; the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually . ; Again , if you have enough if you have enough ; No
Btr002_1743	ba	and he was like , " I I I I I I I I I " ; Oh ! ; And it was I mean it was kind of sad ; but it was , like , also really interesting to watch ,
Bro019_795	s	So - some of the proposal , uh , we 're doing this on the bin on the FFT bins , ; Hmm . ; others on the um , mel energies . ; You can do both ,
Bed012_414	qy	Is that your point ? ; Well , no . I I guess my question is , Is the reason that we can make a node f ; or OK . So , lemme see if I 'm confused . ; Are we going to make a node for every question ?
Bro024_116	ba	But if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice . ; It 's uh , I think the thing is to get something that 's practical , that that you could really use . ; Huh . ; That 's that 's interesting .
Bmr025_612	%--	Yeah . ; And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive ; and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . ; Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna
Bro005_263	b	Yeah . ; So , PLP ; Eighty - eight point six . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_522	s	Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . ; And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . ; And in my answer back was " are you sure you just want one ? " ; So I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure " well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months " .
Bed002_872	qw	I mean , uh yo you 're told So when your task is , I don't know , " Go buy stamps " or something like that ? ; So , do you have to respond ? ; or does your ; Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ?
Bro028_267	b	Uh - huh . ; But it may be something else ; th at least you could say it was . ; Yeah .
Bdb001_243	bk	Right ? ; Because you have a two - gigabyte limit on most O Ss . ; Right , ; OK .
Bmr002_810	s	Well , yeah , ; I mean , if you start with a a basic transcription and a good filter . You can ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , that 's sort of my feeling about it ,
Bmr028_1350	no	If you don't say that , then people think " oh , they did that and they threw that , but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world " . ; But if you say " we did a n cheating experiment " , which is really the standard way you 'd say it , it says you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something . ; Just as part as your process . ; So it 's I d I don't know ,
Bed004_535	h	OK . ; And it it would do us no good . ; That ; Ah .
Bmr011_345	b	That would be cool . ; Yeah , that would be neat . ; or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want ; Yeah .
Bed014_500	%--	and the Bayes - net figures out which under the c situation in general is more likely ? ; Um , or should it just activate this , have this be false , ; and the Bayes - net figures out whether this actually now means ? ; Uh w that 's a s
Bmr010_420	s	Hmm . ; And then and then ; the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel , ; which then would also serve Liz 's request of having ,
Bmr028_118	s	And that 's alright , ; because at at a hundred samples that 's already pretty far out . ; And , uh so I think it looks pretty good , ; but I 'll let Liz look at it and see what she thinks .
Bmr028_1302	s	So it does a it does a word alignment , like you have to do for scoring , ; Mm - hmm . ; And then it does also some ; but it constrains the words to lie within the t the time bins of the reference .
Bmr024_486	s	Mm - hmm . ; So should be a little bit better . ; Right . ; That won't be perfect the alignments aren't perfect ,
Bmr014_1195	b	Yeah . ; So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , ; phone and in person . ; Yeah .
Bmr029_4	%--	OK . So the one one thing I knew I wanted to talk about was about , uh , sort of last minute stuff to to , uh , try to get some recognition results . ; Recognition results ; Yeah . ; for
Bmr018_1666	aa	because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on ; and then that 's it for the r for all of time . ; I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it these these things matters matter . ; Yeah , that 's it .
Bmr022_902	s	Yeah . ; Yeah , but I don't know that one . ; So what 's that mean ? ; This it 's it 's a cell phone jack .
Bmr029_378	b	Uh , Chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know , um ; Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone . ; In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_626	bk	that 's in twelve minutes ? ; No no no . ; I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane , ; Oh , OK .
Bmr008_182	s	Mm - hmm . ; I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that , if you don't know about the meeting ? ; yeah ; Where 'd This is just Well , you know , we 're we 're talking at at a general level of description .
Bed009_559	s	You have to ; Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner ; That 'd be nice . ; or It 's really gonna be an action planner .
Bed015_608	bd	uh , the purely form cues , yeah . ; So . ; Mmm . ; And , um I mean , you 're you 're the linguist
Bmr027_377	s	OK . ; So maybe , uh , I you know , that 's not that many people ; and if I if , uh ; i i there is an advantage to having them admit
Bmr029_897	s	Yeah . Leave it out , ; and Um , in the event that I retrain the short models , ; um , why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out , ; and I I 'll throw them out , too .
Bmr028_1085	aa	Well , first you have to filter the whole training set and retrain . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro019_343	%--	So I tried ; uh , ; And u First I tried just LDA . ; And then I found that
Btr001_902	2	Mm - hmm , ; mm - hmm . ; PRN . ; How it was really pronounced ?
Bmr027_189	s	It was it was not the best characterization . ; But what what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not n no m no overlap with our present members . ; And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , ; something like a week before that ,
Bro027_1517	s	I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters ,
Bro013_476	s	And what 's th what this ? ; Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum . ; Of the ; this is the variance ,
Bed003_534	aap	well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object ; right ? ; the argument in a sense ? ; Usually .
Bro016_833	s	OK . ; So , um . ; Right . ; So the question is Yeah . Whatever they are at that point , um , are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is gonna be a good or a bad thing ?
Bns001_240	aa	No ? ; OK , It was @ @ . ; This afternoon you mean ? ; Yeah .
Bmr014_728	%--	you wanna figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where I ; I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . ; And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , " ; and then that group would need it
Bed016_512	%--	I was ac actually worried about bibtex . ; Uh . No , that 's quite possible . ; That 's copy and paste from something . ; So I did note
Bmr013_414	b	So I think that 's sorta qualitatively different . ; Right . ; You can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified . ; Hmm .
Bro008_200	x	I th I think I I think they are , ; Yeah , well ; yeah . ; So um , since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others , uh , we 'll have to get done a little quicker .
Bsr001_1622	b	I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question . ; Oh , yeah . ; Yeah , sure . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr022_1187	%--	It 's not remote . ; The nice thing about CVS is is , you can be on a different machine . ; But at that point we only want , probably , Jane to be in control anyway , ; and she
Bmr011_655	s	Mmm . ; So , uh , I don't think we can share the resource in that way . ; But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours ; which might be useful for for them .
Bed009_1021	%--	Whatever . ; So all that kind of information could be combined into decision networks and give you decisions . ; But the other half of the problem is How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ? ; So , um
Bmr011_390	s	if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a ; Yeah . ; if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . ; And if if someone 's talking on on on , uh , one side or the other , it goes the other way .
Bro011_317	s	Um . So continuing to um extend ; Uh . ; What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? ; And and S Shawn , yeah .
Bsr001_1687	s	Uh - huh . ; But , uh , just mixing the ; Yeah . ; just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously .
Bsr001_1056	s	Switchboard , for instance . ; They have five is kind of ; OK , you have two people talking , ; it 's the closest thing .
Bro010_972	%--	the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . ; And , um , it didn't do nearly as well , ; especially in in noise . ; But the
Bro013_521	no	Yeah . ; And this is the difference ? ; And this is ; I don't know .
Bed012_957	co	Right . ; But still finite . ; OK . ; No , wait .
Bmr029_659	b	but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old in the close - talking , uh , version . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bmr014_457	%--	You don't know what they could be . ; Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear ; Yeah . ; but uh there are things that are not so well known , in
Bmr015_561	s	Uh , for speakers , M or F and then three numbers , ; For , uh and , uh , ; that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth ; and keep it consistent .
Bro013_717	b	and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block . ; Mm - hmm . ; That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_745	b	Yeah . ; It 's just a HMM , Gaussian mixture model . ; Gaussian mixture HMM . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_1100	bh	I don't think it was . ; No ; they were they were comparable . ; It wasn't ?
Bro012_1264	b	So we 're talking about something a little different . ; Mmm . ; Oh , I 'm sorry . ; Mmm .
Bed003_162	aa	Right . ; Something you want to inspect at close range because it 's interesting . ; The ; Exactly .
Bed017_418	qw	it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . ; So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , ; um , what kind of software is the person using , ; which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment ,
Bed008_79	s	right ? ; And so that a decision would be do we want that ; so you could two different things you could do , ; you could have all those values for Go - there
Btr001_1760	b	And everyone else is laughing , ; and then the other person is like " ha - ha " ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_420	s	Utterance . ; Just marks ? ; So it 's implicit in in there ; but you have to do a lot of processing to get it .
Bed013_150	b	Which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . Right ? ; Eh , n ; Which is basically , " I don't know where something is and I need to go there " . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1367	b	and so it probably wasn't , actually ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed008_848	s	Yeah . ; if if we have it . ; Yeah . ; OK just for starters
Bro004_602	s	It 's ; no , ; the third part , ; so it 's uh highly mismatched .
Bro016_636	bk	You can't look at the whole utterance and do anything . You know , you can only ; Oh , ; Right ? ; right .
Bmr013_658	s	Mm - hmm . ; Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean ; Uh , not really as ; Poten - potentially .
Bmr020_459	d	but but it 's f i i ; That 's OK ; but ; Comma also or not ?
Bro010_68	x	and ; You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? ; No . ; No .
Bmr019_820	b	and it would be really useful to have , like , a a transcriber who could use Waves , ; um , just mark , like , the beginning and end of the foreground speaker 's real words ; like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word ; Yeah .
Bmr022_1118	s	I mean , I I SUX to doctor - speech w when I need to make a a directory on , uh , one of the ; Nnn ; Oh , do you ? ; Oh . So tha that 's what I meant ,
Bro005_750	b	so it 's ; Um . ; Yeah , but ; Yeah .
Bed006_315	s	and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks ; and I said " sure we need help ; you can come in as a subject " ; and he said " OK " .
Bro008_509	s	And I don't know how far , or if you guys even had a chance to try that , but that would be some it 'd be interesting to me . ; Yeah , but ; S b ; Again , it 's the kind of of thing that , uh , we were thin thinking thinking that it would work , but it didn't work .
Bro021_25	b	No ? ; OK . ; So why don't we just around and people can give updates . ; Oh .
Bmr023_964	b	Mm - hmm . ; But , um ; Um . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1380	s	if you try to n go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge huge space of time ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; and things covering several screens
Bmr024_1451	qw	And so , w so , just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set . ; Yeah . ; And so , we haven't done that yet . ; Now the other que related question , though , is is , uh , what 's the boot models for these things ?
Bmr009_1352	aa	So , th I 'm from Kansas , actually . ; And Colorado , right across the border , would be North Midland . ; Southern Midland . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1840	s	Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . ; or it ; Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like ; I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations .
Bro017_486	s	Yeah . ; Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection , ; we say " well you know how come ? " ; Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them .
Bmr028_256	s	OK . Great ! ; But it ; OK . ; I couldn't get the words and the waveform at the same time for some reason ,
Bro012_500	%--	So . ; And is that ; wh what ; do you know what piece
Bed010_893	aa	OK . ; We - well it hasn't it it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case . ; Just checking . ; No sir .
Btr002_2725	b	A lot of times , though , the breaths are , um , results of bad segmentation , ; but ; and there 's a segmentation of nothing , ; Oh yes !
Buw001_393	s	because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . ; Well ; But , I think it would give ; That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,
Bro011_367	s	and do you combine them using the soft " AND - OR " or you do something , you know , more complicated ; um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? ; The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . ; But then the other thing is to do something better
Bed011_1111	b	" Where is X ? " ; might be another one which is not too complicated . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_884	s	It seems quite robust to noise , ; so when we take we draw its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . So there are there is this .
Bed014_72	s	Are you in charge ? ; Sure . ; Um . ; Well , I sort of had informal talks with most of you .
Btr002_1548	aa	A sort of , like , happy medium , so you can make sure that the waveform has its , like , th g shape . ; Uh , right . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1689	b	Mm - hmm , ; And we need all the same machinery . ; right . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_1275	b	there were two parts to the task , ; one of them was to see if that 's what they actually said , ; and to indicate , you know , in the i transcribe errors of it . ; Mmm .
Bmr002_620	%--	you know , they 're trying to set up a a work bench or something or other . ; And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue
Btr002_1003	s	Th - that backspace and the little ; Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place . ; and the th yeah , that little evil apostrophe that keeps showing up . ; The little accent thingy .
Bro003_674	s	And then , there 's the testing corpus . ; So , then I think it 's probably instructive to go and and and show you the features that we were talking about . ; Um , ; so , let 's see .
Bmr028_882	b	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant . ; Mmm .
Bro019_1273	s	you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , ; and let the ; But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , ; maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information .
Bmr020_1577	b	but um , I can't can't really tell . ; Right . ; So I So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there a spurt that 's that 's uh , interrupted ? ; Yeah .
Buw001_698	%--	Mm - hmm . ; so that later we can do other things with it . ; Yeah . ; So so to address what what Adam 's saying ,
Bed013_935	t1	So this this includes the the current utterance plus all the previous utterances . ; Interesting , ; uh - huh . ; User .
Bmr019_368	t3	Mm - hmm . ; I mean , I I guess I 'm saying I don't know if we 'd want to do that as the as ; Other way . ; Other way .
Bro003_453	%	And and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing , ; Mm - hmm . ; Well , the inputs are one dimension of the cube , ; or ?
Bmr018_645	b	Oh . ; Hmm ! ; which which seemed reasonable given that , you know , the models weren't tuned for for it . ; Oh .
Bro014_1414	bk	I guess it depends . ; I mean , how are they doing it ? ; How they 're doing it ? ; Yeah .
Bed002_133	s	This is a mock - up of one . ; Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . ; Um . The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , ; and record it ,
Bmr027_674	s	uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen , ; what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ? ; Right . ; Then we actually have to deal with that
Bmr022_463	s	There must be . ; Because otherwise , you 're going a whole ; I think it should be more , ; It 's possible .
Bmr021_426	aap	right ? ; Right . ; So we could leave those as they are . ; Well , I mean , it just depends on how much disk space is a problem .
Bro024_265	s	I guess not . ; Yeah . ; But ; I mean , usually you have in the training set you have similar conditions ,
Btr002_1543	s	So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter , ; Yeah . ; It 's nice to have ; but I 'll stretch I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something .
Bmr009_636	b	for example " mmm mm - hmm hmm " eh ; And the energy is not eh height ; eh I think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is mmm bigger eh eh eh compared with the with the overlapping eh duration , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_659	s	Yeah . ; So that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say " I got it , no changes " , they 're off the hook . ; Yeah . ; They don't have to go to the web page
Bmr015_1020	%--	Yeah . ; and breaths are part of real speech . ; Well , except that these are really truly ; I mean , ther there 's a segment in o the one I did
Bmr008_1581	ba	Uh - huh . ; For most @ @ . ; So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting ; which I think actually is good , the more I think of it ,
Bed014_268	b	And so on . ; Hmm . ; That ; Yeah .
Bns003_207	s	maybe a few lines , ; maybe a picture . ; And something like that should be added to USAIA ? ; OK , that 's my stuff .
Bmr009_1279	aa	They might say " Other " for Region because they don't know what category to use ; Actually ; but they might have something ; Right .
Bro028_177	b	Mmm ; Are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that . ; Yeah . Uh , there was a p problem that we observed , um , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro008_18	x	Mm - hmm . ; Oh yeah . ; So um , I wan wanna wanna see what that is . ; But , uh , you know , so we 'll see what it is comparatively later .
Buw001_1454	s	Mm - hmm . ; That well , that we want to do ? ; A ; And one and one qualification on on the oral summaries .
Bdb001_602	b	It doesn't ; This isn't quite right . ; I have to look at it again . ; Right .
Bro027_1411	%--	Right . ; The So ; But . ; Yeah , so it 's sort of like
Bro007_104	x	and well but uh actually our results are better than their results . ; Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results ; OK . ; Uh
Btr002_2962	s	Right . ; Yeah . ; And , my feeling on that is , that this isn't really a phonological transcript , ; and potentially those things could probably be rendered ,
Bmr027_94	s	OK . ; Right . ; I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline . ; It 's fine with me if it is ,
Bed009_550	b	We talked about this several times that that the the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end . ; hmm ; In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff . ; Yeah .
Bmr031_1358	b	Mm - hmm . ; But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um ; I mean , he gets incredibly good results if you artificially reverberate clean you know , close close - miked data . ; Right .
Bro021_1004	s	I mean , as ; Yeah . ; But we can ; uh , we we know that , for example , the log of E plus B is equal to log of E plus log to B .
Bmr006_1465	s	Yep . ; Oh . ; Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . ; Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed .
Bed016_296	s	and how we solved it , ; and some preliminary observations , ; also , um , ; I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz ,
Bed013_1305	%	and then you can additionally infer , if they 're asking about the location , it 's because they wanna go to that place , ; Mm - hmm . ; in which case , the you 're jumping a step step and saying , " oh , I know where it is ; Yeah .
Bed002_31	s	Yeah . ; So . ; You can see the transcript ? ; There 's two large number strings on the digits ?
Bmr024_397	s	Sure . ; That was it ? ; That was it . ; Just , what do we do with digits ?
Bmr023_875	b	and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better ; Mm - hmm . ; one way or the other . ; Hmm .
Bmr026_927	b	forty - eight phones ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far . ; Yeah .
Bro003_1363	br	Was for me , n it was a difficult work last week with the labels ; because the the program with the label obtained that I have , the Albayzin , is different w to the label to train the neural network . ; And that is another work that we must to do , to to change . ; I I didn't understand .
Bmr028_705	s	I know you 're willing to not work for an hour . ; Yeah , right . ; But , I th ; Because when Abbott is down you can't work .
Bro028_559	g	OK . ; you know , ; sixty - thousand ; Right ?
Bmr015_660	s	Well so then then , maybe the answer is to , uh , listen especially densely in places of overlap , ; just so that they 're they 're not being overlooked because of that , ; Yeah . ; and count on accuracy during the sparser phases .
Bns003_612	b	Well , ; b but I think even also K P N . i is lost for the , uh , for the I C ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bns002_1563	s	Hmm - hmm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; So , ; But take a look to the slides , I will uh deploy it um uh electronically .
Bmr019_739	s	We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . ; But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , ; and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . ; Like , it gives you some weird alignments ,
Bdb001_146	s	because you could you could all you 'd have to change is the , um , time - stamps in the time - line without without , uh , changing the I Ds . ; And you 'd be able to propagate all of the the information ? ; Right . ; That 's , the who that 's why you do that extra level of indirection .
Bmr016_1839	b	cuz I haven't been able to go to all the IC ICSI things , ; Right , exactly . ; and and until they 've been listened to they stay as " ICSI " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_831	%--	Hmm . ; Yeah , ; y I I was whe w w ; just yesterday when I was thinking about it um w what what we could try to do , or do about it
Bmr003_2506	%--	Huge VU meters . ; So people sitting here are going " testing , one , two , three " ! ; It a ; But I mean , that 's another that 's another possibility that , you know , solves
Bed005_1277	s	Uh , or , link to ; or ; but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology . ; It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector .
Bro010_231	s	I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both ; but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . ; To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . ; And and , uh , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .
Bro019_335	s	Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe . ; Yeah . ; Uh , yeah , ; after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions
Bmr028_591	co	I don't know , it 's a ; Well , take a look ; Yeah . ; Do that .
Bsr001_2280	ar	I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting , ; We ; so I didn't . ; no
Bns003_918	%	Yeah . ; because he 's a professor in uh , responsible for the infrastructure at UCB and he has some projects which are related to um , these these , uh , activities ; Landay . ; Ah .
Bmr020_988	b	uh ; I think Jane tightened these up by hand . ; OK , ; OK .
Bmr031_1665	s	No . ; No . No fish . OK . ; No . ; You know , when Bush catches fish
Bed016_654	bd	but , um I don't know . ; All contact . ; I mean , there there 's contact that doesn't social contact , ; whatever .
Bmr003_1673	%--	Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . ; Um , ; and if there are five five people speaking at once , ; Right , i it 's
Bmr028_305	2	It 's a Mon - Monday in four weeks ? ; So If if raw speed is the problem This thing is written in Tcl . ; Three weeks ? ; Tcl .
Bmr011_133	b	Yeah , th that 's good . ; Yeah . ; So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . ; Yes .
Bmr027_1226	s	Yeah . ; I realized something I should talk about . ; So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ? ; Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again .
Bmr020_956	b	Mm - hmm . ; which is A , zero , twenty . ; Yeah . ; Sure .
Bmr002_706	aa	Right . ; We could just do it through these . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro028_683	s	But , what might get at something similar , it just occurred to me , is kind of an intermediate thing ; is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , um , uh , values that come out of the net , ; which are something like log probabilities , ; and scale those .
Bed002_1074	s	When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? ; or that are in the program language Java ? ; No , th It turns out that there is a , uh The new end of Java libraries . ; OK , and it turns out one called
Bmr025_348	s	I don't know if that would be of interest or not . ; at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that ; cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it ; and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point
Bro013_193	bk	and here we 're getting three or four three , ; Mm - hmm . ; let 's see , three for this ? ; Yeah .
Bro021_117	%--	where you did something differently for each , um , uh I don't know whether it was each mel band or each , uh , um , FFT bin or someth ; There was something you were gonna uh , some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency . ; I don't know if that was ; I guess it was
Bro017_879	b	yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , multiply this component uh i it by number b larger than one , ; Mm - hmm .
Bed014_171	s	So it 'll say it 's nonsense with perfect intonation . ; Are we gonna Can we change the voice of the of the thing , ; because right now the voice sounds like a murderer . ; Yep . We ha we have to change the voice .
Bro022_964	b	and I also try different , uh , noise , uh , values ; and we 'll see what happen . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr021_1032	ba	Oh . ; Never mind . ; It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting . ; Yep . Yep . Yeah yeah . That would be good .
Btr001_1435	%--	Uh - huh . ; You know , ; and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that . ; But with nine speakers
Bed002_1310	b	Nuh ? ; but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different . ; So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there . ; Right , yeah .
Bed015_1652	s	where , you know , you 're signing ; and someone says something . ; And then , you know , so " he say " , and then you sort of do a role shift . ; And then you sign " I , this , that , and the other " .
Bmr002_622	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue ; Mm - hmm . ; I mean , you guys are more expert on that , I mean , than I am ,
Bed015_733	b	the new information . ; You know , if I " I walked into the room " , you tend to think that , whatever , " into the room " is sort of like the more focused kind of thing . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr027_328	s	and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released , ; Mm - hmm . ; if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , ; but that 's it " .
Bmr018_761	no	So um , so I don't know what we can do if anything , that 's sort of worth , you know , a Eurospeech paper at this point . ; Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ? ; Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say . ; I haven't checked those yet .
Bed008_765	%--	Well , with the way we 're defining it I think yeah . ; W w ; but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free ; cuz you
Bro023_81	b	Mm - hmm . ; And compared to , um , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance ; but it was just a slight drop . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_656	bk	I can take you to his office . ; It 's just around the corner . ; and ; OK , great .
Bmr021_595	%--	I mean , these ; I looked at the naming conventions ; and they look fine to me , ; but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be
Bed003_1614	b	Oh , oh , sorry . ; Wednesday . ; Day after tomorrow . ; Yeah .
Btr001_318	s	I suspect you haven't ; because this was , uh , earlier on that we had a lot of ; Mm - hmm . ; actually she she was in the middle phase I would say .
Bmr019_357	g	you want to you want to That 's the obvious thing to try . ; Oh . ; Oh . ; Right ?
Bmr003_1178	s	But I 'm not sure . ; I 'd I 'd say ; Ten . ; yeah , I was gonna say eight
Bed004_290	co	So my idea on on Wednesday is partly to uh ; you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine . ; You just uh do " this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and so forth . " ; But then , the other thing of course is we should um give the computer scientists some idea of of what 's going on with the system design ,
Bro023_403	fa	Oh , ; OK . ; So ; Sorry .
Bmr012_1332	s	So ; yeah . ; Oh , where you 're gonna meet ? ; Here mostly
Bmr019_32	s	Digits and alignments . ; But ; Uh . ; Talk about aligning people 's schedules .
Bns002_661	s	You know , the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism . ; And what we are doing here is try to reserve the area of space we are covering ; and eh here 's where our some of our work is done . ; The main idea for for our work , is well , if we are using this reservation mechanism , we are reserving an area of space for a single transmission .
Bro017_1009	%--	you know ; Chuck is getting himself in trouble . ; That 's an interesting idea , actually . ; For testing the
Bmr002_1212	aa	that can be that they can say " OK here 's the vocabulary ; and here 's the you know , here are the pronunciations . And go to it . " ; And are they specifically far field mikes ? ; Yeah .
Bmr024_114	s	and then " beep two beep " and then the phrase . ; And that seems pretty good . ; Um , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file . ; And we have done that on the automatic segmentations .
Bmr009_505	b	But anyway , yeah , we 're not disagreeing on any of this , ; we should look at it more uh more finely , but uh uh I think that This often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple . ; So uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , a a a as as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later . ; Uh - huh .
Bns003_430	s	Uh , ; Yeah , ; So I think th I think both arguments are not an ar are arguments against having this under the normal ICSI page . ; but we we can do that .
Btr001_675	bk	Right . ; So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well . ; Wow . ; Oh .
Bmr022_572	s	h ; an expert can't even tell what they 're talking about . ; Yeah . ; Um , so that 's OK .
Bro021_340	s	the number o of MFCC that was were used was different . ; You used thirteen ; and we used fifteen . ; Well , a bunch of differences .
Bmr020_953	b	ending at twenty . ; Right , ; so that 's three chunks where actually we w can just make one chunk out of that ; Mm - hmm .
Bro019_972	b	Mm - hmm . ; From C . ; Yeah . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr008_444	bk	Let 's see . ; That 's the only other one . ; That 's the only one . ; OK .
Bmr003_1022	bk	Thirty ; So , yeah . ; For thirty dollars an hour for of their work . ; OK .
Bmr016_551	b	but I think someone would have to express interest in that . ; I see . ; I think , to ; OK .
Bmr012_174	%--	which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams ; a bigram recognizer ; and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . ; Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who
Bmr021_879	%--	because it might um , for instance , um remove some of the ; um ; You know , som If you if you have some some difference in the front - end processing that uh is suboptimal , but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around . ; But but apparently that doesn't doesn't really
Btr002_2257	b	Yeah . ; I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful , ; so we sort of screen it out . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_826	s	Mm - hmm . ; Uh , that first set . ; Um , OK . ; They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , uh , transcribing the other set .
Bmr001_546	b	and so it looks at a section , it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bits it can get away with . ; Something like that . ; So I think it On on each block it 'll it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed011_231	b	Oh , ; well , uh th I think there are two places where it comes up . ; One is uh in the th these people who are gonna take this and and try to do speech with it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_575	s	Yeah . ; so I guess you could you could just scale them all . ; Scale ; Variances .
Bmr023_405	b	and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but I wanna do that when she returns . ; Um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a in a span of very short period we asked It seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things , ; and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um ; Hmm .
Bmr021_537	ba	Yeah sure . I 'd like to ; So just update all the naming conventions ; and put all the files where they really belong , on one disk , ; That sounds like a good idea .
Bed011_281	%--	Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job . ; And that can be done , sort of to say , " OK now we 've picked these six tasks . " ; " Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . " ; And th w
Bmr002_859	b	Well that 's what Morgan mentioned to me , too . ; So . ; I mean , if in terms of the t the type ; Yeah .
Bro010_457	b	So , uh ; Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD ; but otherwise it 's it 's on the the , uh the mel fil filter bank , uh , energies I guess ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_1070	b	OK . ; So , um ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr015_133	aa	Yeah , ; it 's ; Yeah , I would , uh , tak do the easy way , ; Yeah .
Bmr011_276	s	OK , second item was the , uh , NIST visit , and what 's going on there . ; Yeah . ; OK , so , um , uh , ; Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February
Bed011_237	2	That 's one . ; So we would rather just ask uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo , ; uh and assume that that will that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places . ; Bigger
Bmr006_209	b	OK . ; Uh - huh . ; So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , I don't see that there 's an argument ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_326	s	And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . ; But ; so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing . ; Well , forced alignment would be one thing .
Bmr006_412	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; They they originally They 've decided not to do go into speech .
Bmr016_307	%--	And they can have , ; I mean , actually , things are getting longer and longer . ; In the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and so forth . ; So , there 's between , um
Bed012_97	s	So , when we input something , we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these . ; Right ? ; OK . ; So there is no way of telling it t not to tell us about the EVA values .
Bns003_25	s	I know for sure , OK , um Miguel , you will have your plans for this , uh , ongoing process , uh , concerning your work . ; OK , from you it 's definitely clear , in principle . ; OK , for Michael , what are your current plans ; and Dietmar , maybe you then , also .
Bed008_877	s	And they 'll be a y uh , a user Go - there ; and maybe that 's all , ; I don't know . ; Situation Go - there ,
Bns002_1112	s	You know , ; uh , I 'm sure that the proposals are OK , ; but eh I don't I don't think that You cannot warr you you I don't think you can warranty too much in these networks . ; So , I see this like a you know , a a topic I 'm not convinced about .
Bed015_1147	bk	maybe you 'd maybe not all these ; I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things . ; No , just to make sure that we everybody that 's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with , uh , form . ; Yeah .
Bmr026_776	b	Uh , well i there was a little bit of a ; i overall . ; They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_858	%--	Right . ; And so we think we think we have a shot at at that . ; OK . ; So . The for
Bed015_288	fa	So I don't know what a form type is . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; I 'm sorry ,
Bmr011_911	bk	Check it and , you know , adjust it , and all that . ; So each person gets one of these channels ; Right . ; OK .
Bns002_484	%--	this is the receiving node , ; and these two areas , of course , there 's something like this , are the uh places of the total space where you can hear the Here , this one is the RTS and this one is the CTS . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , any node ,
Bro008_69	s	I mean , even with these results as they are , it 's it 's it 's really not that bad . ; But but , uh , um ; And it looks like the overall result as they are now , even without , you know , any any bugs being fixed is that , uh , on the the other tasks , we had this average of , uh , forty uh nine percent , or so , improvement . ; And here we have somewhat better than that than the Danish , and somewhat worse than that on the German ,
Bmr016_1501	s	It was fascinating , I was listening to some of these , uh , I guess two nights ago , ; and it 's just hilarious to liste to to do a search for the " mm - hmm 's " . ; And you get " mm - hmm " ; and diff everybody 's doing it .
Bro023_1527	s	but if the time frame is long enough , uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , uh , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy . ; I 'm confused . ; Mmm ? ; You said five hundred milliseconds
Bed006_626	s	And um . ; And then you pick pick a movie and and and it show shows you the times ; and you pick a time ; and you pick seats and all of this .
Bmr020_1321	bk	Uh , it really depends . ; Um , my my my impression is that it 's better for meetings with fewer speakers , ; and it 's better for for meetings where nobody is breathing . ; Oh ,
Bmr022_817	b	We have lots o of choices of microphones . ; I mean , can we keep the microphones , and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Mmm .
Bro025_498	aa	Just one more thing . ; Like , should we do something f more for the noise estimation , ; because we still ? ; Yeah . I was wondering about that .
Bmr019_724	s	and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying " mixed " ; I think , Morgan . ; Yeah , yeah . ; And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal .
Bro028_1051	%--	I mean , eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago , ; so I know it 's pretty old , ; uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis ; in which you which
Bmr005_921	s	I consider I I The the nnn The the three hundred is eh considered only you your transcription . ; I have to to finish transcribing . ; So . ; I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle .
Bmr005_275	aa	" If Person X " ; Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it , ; you know . ; Yeah .
Bro010_15	fa	Well ; oh , ; Oh . Conference call . ; I 'm sorry .
Bed004_888	b	Right . ; Yeah , and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff ; l No , it was great . ; Yeah .
Bro012_919	%--	Yeah , but it 's not clear , ; yeah . ; So uh ; We
Btr002_1013	b	Oh , yeah . ; Yeah . ; So . ; Hmm .
Bmr014_234	s	Uh , no , ; No ? ; we 're having the them do it . ; So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it .
Bro014_1405	b	No . ; Maybe we can do that . ; Mmm . ; Hmm .
Bmr010_1005	%--	And I said , " well for our purposes , ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I do have a convention . If it 's an a noncanonical p "
Buw001_2236	bk	because I can't ; I mean , of the Jane took my answer . ; Ah ! ; Oh .
Bmr025_206	s	So . ; It certainly helps . ; Uh - huh . ; Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it .
Bmr024_1264	s	Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . ; So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test . ; Yeah . ; And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test .
Bmr006_1325	s	Right . ; I mean , it 's not to say I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . ; Yeah , yeah . ; But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things .
Bed008_643	b	and this will give you the flavor of the of what ; you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . ; Mm - hmm . ; Uh .
Bmr006_1014	x	Yeah . ; Yeah . I Yeah . But eh I I Is my my my own vision , of the of the project . ; So , some sort of ; That 's
Bns002_269	bk	OK ? ; because well uh this node is not able to hear this other node because of the distance uh , between them . ; But Uh , this problem , as you can see in the in the picture , is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes . ; OK ,
Bro023_47	s	Wh - Back when I was a grad student he was here for a , uh , uh a year or n six months . ; N nine months . ; Something like that . ; Something like that .
Bmr024_1506	s	And with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; And so , then we switched to new boot alignments ,
Bro012_1067	no	Improves the baseline ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use .
Btr001_2624	s	you know exactly what the person should have said ; and you check to be sure , ; and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked . ; Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , uh , reading these things ,
Bro012_70	s	so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other ; but if we do make use of the cheap mikes , uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it . ; And then again if it 's ; uh depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of .
Bed013_1467	b	a y y y You can listen to all of them from your Solaris box . ; OK . ; If you want . ; Right .
Bed012_212	qw	Yeah , so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief - net . ; But , why why why only those three ? ; Why not the whol ; Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question .
Bmr020_933	%--	But the but there 's yeah , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech . ; Because ; So ; Like when we went t to
Bmr026_1058	b	Uh , yeah . ; I mean . I think I agree with Ad ; I mean basically you would then You proceed with the embedded training . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro025_628	b	or ? ; For ; Can you use the same net that you that I was talking about to do the VAD ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_456	%--	Mm - hmm . ; So , uh ; so this was , uh ; And so this was giving
Bmr007_705	b	Well , linguistic ; And , uh ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bmr028_1620	qo	But , I mean , that doesn't really help ; because often the recording person isn't in the room . ; Oh , I see . ; So , what are you gonna do ?
Bmr020_419	%--	but yes , ; dramatically . ; Less so . ; So we have to
Bmr012_984	s	I don't know . ; I don't know . ; I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . ; I I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort
Bmr019_889	%	Just ha uh , trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that ; Mm - hmm . ; you could actually get something , um uh , uh , get an objective measure . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed002_73	%--	or ? ; No . There was there was Let 's see . ; Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? ; Oh
Bed008_705	%--	S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? ; Subgrouping , basically ; Yeah . ; into mo
Btr001_929	aa	OK . ; So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little apostrophe , or whatever you call it , ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bmr028_900	s	because they own that microphone . ; Right . ; I 'm just wondering There 's ; Yeah . That that becomes another problem , actually .
Bmr031_1512	b	and so we should talk off - line . ; OK . ; But if you have a certain speaker and you wanna sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it , you know , directly on a feature to to like a decision tree that won't normalize anything for you once you feed it the features , how do you sort of normalize over a particular speaker ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_488	s	But ; but at some point somebody should just show me the cube . ; It sounds s ; I I get I think I get the general idea of it ,
Bmr010_1193	s	So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot . ; Um . But , uh , ; you know , they both help each other . ; If you have a if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner .
Bed015_1607	s	Yeah . ; So so by default ; There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a a verb of saying then ; um , you know , you say something like or or I was thinking you can say something like , " oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican " or something like that .
Btr001_811	s	yeah . ; Yeah . ; So , um , in did you have you run into places ; I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin .
Bed005_198	s	not a sequence ? ; Yeah . We were I was afraid that , um ; Oh ! ; So it really is key word matching , basically .
Bro003_513	s	I I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech . ; That 's right . ; Well , especially when you go over the different languages again , ; because you 'd the different languages have different words for the different digits ,
Bro007_52	%--	And those two together . ; Two HTK . ; That 's it . ; Um . So this is
Bns001_1400	s	Then I can add a couple of cards at most , ; because mmm the majority of the of the notebooks only have two PC cards uh type two slots . ; So ; In in the better case , maybe I 'm only able to add two different networks to this thing .
Bmr006_171	s	But ; Well , I think that , um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . ; Yeah . ; And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .
Bmr008_1024	s	Shall we wait for other forms later , or you Keep going more form ; No , you got what 's the other form ? ; Uh , the other form is a modified digits form . ; uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple ,
Bro021_979	b	OK . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Cuz it doesn't just follow what 's there . ; Uh - huh .
Btr001_2790	bk	Uh - huh . ; Pause briefly between lines . ; Yes , ; Right .
Bro008_249	s	And then on the terminal 's side , I don't know how much , um , memory and and CPU it takes , but it seems like the filtering Uh , ; I mean , the VAD stuff they both had , ; right ? ; And , um , so and they both had some kind of on - line normalization ,
Bmr020_621	s	About ; Well , I didn't know about Liz 's finding on that , ; Uh - huh . ; but I know of another paper that talks about something
Btr002_417	%--	You know . And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant ; " Groups of " ; and maybe it 's an " M " to you . ; Well , also
Bsr001_1942	s	I see . ; Hmm . ; So , ; yeah , that 's that 's the way we 've been approaching it .
Bmr002_336	aa	And , ; Yeah . ; Do you have to speak true English sentences when you do this ? ; Yeah ,
Bro023_955	bd	So , um , ; uh , ; i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , " well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation " . ; It 's just a thought .
Bmr023_230	b	And so he talked it over with the transcriber ; and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2540	bk	the the hum we hear right now is actually the projector , ; Yeah , yeah . ; A all right . ; But the projector ,
Bmr006_1315	aa	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; It seems like that would be pretty strong . ; Yeah . Oh , yeah .
Bmr020_426	%--	Maybe we can look at it Monday . ; I would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than ; Yes . ; It 's It 's
Bro023_1153	b	But we 're not listening to it , usually . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I know . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_797	%--	but it does take twice . ; I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change . ; Yeah , yeah , ; but
Bmr005_77	%--	OK . ; Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of you know , relating to his to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , ; and uh , the need to build in , um , this this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . ; And he gave the example in his talk about how um ,
Bmr026_825	aa	An ; Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh ; So . ; I I think so .
Bdb001_194	%--	Definitely . ; Mm - hmm . ; For lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that I just I don't know . ; I don't know if that
Btr002_2956	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah . ; Yeah , yeah . Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr013_531	ba	Anyway , this is , not an urgent thing at all , ; Yeah . ; just it came up . ; It 'd be very interesting though , to have that data .
Bed002_565	aa	Right . ; Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah . ; Right . ; Yeah .
Bro014_1565	%--	and , uh , the importance of it in speech recognition . ; And I found some some , uh , neat papers , um , historical papers from , um , Kanedera , Hermansky , and Arai . ; Yeah . ; And they they did a lot of experiments where th where , um , they take speech and , um , e they modify the , uh
Bmr023_1101	b	which is right . ; N ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bed014_173	s	because right now the voice sounds like a murderer . ; Yep . We ha we have to change the voice . ; Wh - Which one ? ; The the little Smarticus
Bed015_1577	bk	For what ? ; If it works . ; Uh , uh , uh , I haven't told you what it is yet . ; Mm - hmm . Mmm .
Bmr006_338	s	Yeah . ; you know , each person who 's interested in I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . ; Right . ; And So in my case , um , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .
Bsr001_2426	b	Right . ; Mmm . ; The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich , ; Right .
Bmr018_372	%--	But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them , ; Yes . ; Yes . ; and they have multiple ,
Bmr007_637	s	Right , I mean Adam was ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; so Once we 're done with this stuff discussing ,
Bmr021_713	s	Hmm . Mmm , OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; And um that 's all done um by the script , ; and it works great .
Bmr008_175	s	right ? ; Well , absolutely ! ; Let 's say the undergrad was an expert in physics , and ; But but you want to have that information .
Bed013_119	g	Well , I 've I 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years . ; And so it 's it 's you 're right , ; it 's not the same as the understanding . ; It 's in some ways easier and some ways harder . nuh ?
Bmr014_342	s	So . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; So , that 's why we 're not seeing him .
Bmr022_835	s	don't they ? ; Specially . ; You know . I mean , here 's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity . ; We have something like forty - five hours of data collected .
Buw001_1619	t1	Yeah . ; Um , ; Right . ; let 's see .
Bed002_648	s	Oh , how to extract these features . ; how to extract them . ; OK . ; So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,
Bmr006_417	aa	but I 'll send an email and ask . ; Tell them about the free lunch . ; I 'll tell them about the free lunch . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1871	bk	Well , that 's me personally . ; Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues . ; Yeah . ; I see .
Bed006_734	s	Like are we adapting to it ? ; Or ; No . ; We This is the output , sort of , of the natural language understanding ,
Bro014_406	ar	Um , ; so you should weight those other conditions v very you know , really small . ; But ; No .
Bmr009_562	s	That would be great . ; Yeah . ; That would be really great . ; So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction .
Btr002_2944	%--	Yeah . ; because , you know , at this point , we 're at the at the really fine grain level of of standardization which I hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before , ; and , um , wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things . ; These are ,
Bed014_1009	s	yeah . ; So . ; Right . ; And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room .
Bro026_576	%--	Yeah , th I I guess it 's almost ready . ; Uh - huh . ; So ; That 's what
Bmr002_1258	b	I don't know how large this is , actually . ; But I just was sort of thinking that um I 'm I 'm ; and it 's British ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1627	s	Dan David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk , ; which means it 's not backed up . ; So , ; um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks .
Bed006_1096	s	Right . ; Or the intended interpretation of this . ; Yeah . ; um well I should have we should have added an ano an XML example ,
Buw001_1789	s	We also had the , uh , uh that we were s uh , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number ; and we 're all gonna ; Oh , yeah . ; we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing
Bed008_571	%--	And ; OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ? ; No . ; Or ?
Bsr001_386	s	Yeah it is , ; I ; yeah . ; I mean , it 's my impression . I mean , of course there is a lot more work to do with this one
Bmr015_93	s	just to finish out the test set . ; Oh ! By throw them out completely ? ; Um , the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said . ; So those are those are the two options .
Bmr028_459	s	He 's not around , is the only problem . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh , is that right ? ; Oh . I saw him I saw him on Tuesday .
Btr002_646	s	You have these y y you still have The frequencies are represented ; but the energy distributions are thrown off , ; and , um , in fact you have also some additional frequencies . ; So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally ,
Bed011_355	%--	No question . ; Right . ; So ; uh w do we wanna get going beyond more , which is sort of the
Bmr014_569	bk	But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . ; So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah .
Bed010_160	qw	and , s deliberately . ; So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . ; It 's just for closure . ; So that if we come up with a question of " could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? " or something .
Bmr006_1485	%--	Digits ? ; Right . ; No - well , we don't have to do digits . ; Well , why don't we
Bmr001_649	%--	uh . ; So , can we do we do another set ? ; Sure . ; Are we are we are we sort of
Bed004_206	s	OK , ; great . ; So first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her . ; Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well .
Bmr010_1052	s	I mean , this was something that we were talking about . ; We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times . ; Right ? ; One for each participant .
Bro011_630	x	Are the SP 's optional ? ; I mean skip them ? ; I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . ; Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it .
Btr002_1108	s	That 's all I know . ; but now I 'm I 'm just used to it . ; You 're multi - keyb ; I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati .
Bro008_563	b	Yeah , Amsterdam . ; yeah ? ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bed013_607	bk	I d don't quote me on this . ; This is numbers I I have from looking o ; How many characters are on a line ? ; OK .
Bro023_1620	s	Yeah . ; I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction . ; OK . ; So I 'm also using that n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying .
Bmr003_2498	%--	Yeah . ; Good . ; What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ? ; Uh , the , uh Tsk .
Bmr001_725	b	I mean . ; But I think that 's alright . ; Yeah , it 's great . ; Yeah .
Bro026_935	b	Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think ; on yourself . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bro024_424	s	OK . ; Um , so for the past , uh , week an or two , I 've been just writing my , uh , formal thesis proposal . ; Um , so I 'm taking this qualifier exam that 's coming up in two weeks . ; And I I finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee .
Bmr031_1307	b	Yeah . ; So . ; Um , on the recognition side , actually , um , I think the main person doing that is , uh , Harriet from Harriet Nock from , uh formerly of Cambridge . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_510	bk	OK , see you . ; OK . ; No . ; Bye .
Bro016_439	b	Um . ; But you ma you may really wanna add other things later anyway ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1511	b	Certainty . ; notion of of how on a good meeting , how often uh , do you get segments that come in the middle of words and so forth , ; and uh in a bad meeting how often ? ; Uh .
Bsr001_1119	%	Yeah . ; but they don't expect anything in return . ; Right . ; So pi
Bed009_525	s	That would ; b but that I think that that uh point has been realized ; and it 's it 's not really um been defined yet ; but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is .
Bns002_895	s	It won't be a problem for your pocket , ; for your wallet , ; but maybe it will be a problem for the environment . ; So , I think that the answer to your question is in this line ,
Bed010_320	s	and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . ; Yeah we may run across one or two more . ; But of course the connections weren't . ; So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff .
Bmr008_944	s	oh No , no . ; I wasn't thinking political at all . ; Oh , OK . ; I was just saying , looking at applications of people over the years for post - docs here .
Bmr013_128	s	Hmm . ; Um , so , uh . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . ; Hmm . ; It 's gonna be fun to see how we , compare at this .
Bmr018_496	bs	Right . ; And then you would switch into the other ; so . ; But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying .
Bmr027_1321	b	It 's great to be able to do it , ; Good . ; just say " oh yeah , a hundred gig , ; Yeah .
Bed013_227	s	Th - that 's big . ; That 's just That 's uh It 's a billion , right ? ; Two to the thirty ? ; Well , two to the thirty is a billion ,
Bro010_213	s	so , uh , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , ; which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . ; Uh , which is we say , well this is the way we should do it . ; And then we do it .
Bro022_485	s	So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . ; And , um , ; the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , ; um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases .
Bmr029_552	bk	and subtract it , ; and we don't ; Right . ; Right .
Bro012_498	%--	and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one . ; OK , so we are getting hurt somewhat . ; So . ; And is that
Bro025_99	s	And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance . ; And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra . ; Mm - hmm . ; Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals
Bro004_938	%--	I see , OK . ; So it 's Well , it 's basically a standard net with fewer classes . ; So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago ; instead of
Btr002_915	b	I didn't n even even know you could do that . ; I vary . ; I I should it depends on how much I wanna go back ; Yeah .
Btr002_2866	s	It wasn't interruptions ; it was overlaps , that I was thinking about . ; Uh - huh . I think this is really ; Not enough overlaps .
Bro017_908	s	But if your ; If your um original data for C - one had a mean of two . ; Uh - huh . ; And now you 're you 're you 're changing that by squaring it .
Bmr016_1308	s	Haven't been awfully precise about that , ; but I have here , ; now we 're about to get to the to this now , ; I have frequencies .
Bmr031_1259	ba	Yeah . I I think he 's b he 's been he will have been off , like , two months out of his first seven in office . ; Yeah . It 's amazing . ; Yeah . It 's hard to keep concentration , you know , ; That 's a pretty good deal .
Bmr023_628	ba	Um , so these are based on forced alignment . ; Word features like , um , word frequency ; and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . ; So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns .
Bmr029_824	s	Which is , uh ; Do you have this , uh ? ; I think so . ; I 've I I have to check .
Bro021_830	bk	Um . ; So maybe if you tested it using that , you 'd have more reliable stretches of nonspeech to do the estimation from ; and see if that helps . ; Yeah .
Bro011_583	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so they had sixteen . ; So that 's pretty close . ; Um but for the most of the words are sh much shorter .
Bmr016_176	s	cuz if I did I 'd probably try to collect it , you know , without bothering this group , ; but If we can try it ; OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits ; not as connected numbers .
Bro004_901	s	which is is also something like nine classes . ; And then , something that combine both , ; and we have twenty f twenty - five ? ; Twenty - seven .
Bmr011_1448	s	If that 's not the case then ; So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group ; but even there he hadn't ; What he 'd said " no " to was for the main meeting .
Bsr001_720	b	Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , the other task probably is also , you know , challenging the comp the the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language . ; So a ; Right .
Bed006_1505	cc	and and get rid of the uh blah - blah - X - blah uh asterisk sub - action item altogether . ; OK . ; No no problem with that ; and we w we we will play around with all of them
Bed002_518	%--	Yeah . ; But it wouldn't . ; OK . ; But that doesn't necessarily
Bed005_665	bk	Yeah , yeah . ; So what would ; Hmm ? ; OK .
Bed013_594	ba	I don't know . ; Not including figures and such ? ; I don't know . ; Very unspecific unfortunately .
Bmr009_142	%--	Yeah . ; So . ; Yeah . ; But that 's
Bed014_1421	b	Yeah . ; Like th that 's the conclusion . OK . ; So , you your dance card is completely filled now ? ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_102	s	or on English only , ; and testing on Italian . ; Mm - hmm . ; And training the net on French only
Bed006_276	s	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; But they will um ; There 's nothing that says you know " these are the things you want to do " ; so they 'll say " well these are the things I want to do "
Bmr003_1400	bk	Why , that 's ; That 's not something I wanted to have happen . ; No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for m for video or for audio where you you need to do this , ; I see .
Bro024_1443	aa	OK . ; Yes . ; So you so you just should look at that fifty - eight perc point O nine percent and so on . ; Right .
Bro005_1222	qo	So , yeah , but we 've ; I don't know . ; We have to get some reference point to where we ; Well , what 's a reasonable number ?
Bed015_1505	s	I think . ; Mmm . ; I mean , how else would you um ; You know , uh , uh , it 's the speaker may in English is allowed to say " I . "
Btr002_1283	s	Good . ; Oh wow . ; And so it shows , ; I mean it 's it 's useful .
Bns002_1418	s	Uh , So I started uh , for for advertising the project proposal here to provide a few slides ; I think , first of all , Wilbert , is not here , ; second um , the um link here was uh enabling UMTS services and application , ; uh , I assume was not read yesterday night .
Bns002_705	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Is it not possible then , if I send something and I could not find any neighbor because one of the cluster below , ; This is the next .
Bed016_540	s	Um , but I I did not focus on that aspect ; but , um Ehhh , ; um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . ; So it 's the last paragraph
Bmr008_1643	b	I suppose this is still just that one that one data sample , ; right , ; that one meeting ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2204	%	It 's like a m it 's like a ; You know ? ; I mean , " so " tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying . ; so .
Bro017_1227	b	Mm - hmm . ; Because Morgan 's point is that He is an experienced guy . ; He says " well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes , except which is not s is not the same . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr030_737	ar	OK . ; Do we have new DD disks also ? ; and ; No .
Bmr019_372	bk	Liz ; Now you 're all watching me . ; It f it clips over your ears . ; Alright .
Bed008_299	%--	And the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse . ; What he has mentioned before . ; OK , so this is w ; Right , so what w I what we seem to need here ,
Btr002_2908	b	Mm - hmm . ; I should say , I didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions . ; So some of these were backchannels and things like that . ; Yeah .
Bmr005_1215	s	and we don't have any say about it ; and it 's typically one microphone , ; in a , uh , uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want . ; Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .
Bmr006_364	b	So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_2015	ba	Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz . ; Bits , sixteen - K , ; OK , s ; Eh , good good .
Bed010_126	s	That 's fine . ; It 's eee messy ; but once you understand it you understand it . ; It 's it 's There 's nothing really complicated about it .
Bro024_1655	ar	Mm - hmm . ; and and later on you smooth also this subtraction factor . ; Mmm ; Uh , no ,
Bmr018_901	s	And we 'll just have to see how hard that is . ; Yeah , ; that 's right . ; So so whether the corrections take too much time .
Bro003_1429	ba	And , uh , uh , ; we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI , ; so I think that i if ; What 's what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way ,
Bns001_110	s	So , with the advent of this new technology , low power uh , high , uh , processing capability and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package , new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing , in the market . ; And , eh , well this is more or less what I have done . ; And the kind of , uh , things , I 'm interested is more or less all , around this these kind of networks . ; But I could say , uh in general , mobile service is not only about , uh these specific kind of networks .
Bmr002_1185	s	there ; OK . ; Yeah . ; Close mikes .
Bro003_113	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty ,
Bro007_354	s	and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; and then we 'll operate with that
Bmr013_722	aa	cuz I don't quite unders ; so , would you be training then , um , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? ; So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , uh , to , providing tighter time bands ? ; I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah .
Buw001_644	s	Right . ; Huh . ; Right . ; And that the at some point that might be awfully useful .
Bmr011_454	s	They wanted to do it ; I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work . ; Uh , well I think they 've instrumented a room ; but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet .
Bed012_860	s	What ? ; It sounds like an F . ; I ; There 's also an F in German ,
Bro028_102	no	so it 's maybe not that expensive . ; But ; Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ? ; I d I d uh , I I don't kn remember exactly ,
Bmr026_427	s	Yeah . ; and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are ; Well ; and we won't be using the old ones anymore .
Buw001_455	b	And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , ; and they can use it for their research . ; I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_1784	s	I think we 've run it ; well , uh . ; Oh . ; We 're out of mikes .
Bro017_168	b	Yeah . ; Uh it may be that that ; Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1509	b	OK . ; So if we could , or if you could do some of it , ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro007_39	b	Yeah . ; Uh - huh . ; The third path is this low - pass filter . ; Uh - huh .
Bmr009_684	s	I mean . That 's something we don't know . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's possible to try it both ways , ; Well , I mean we 're also talking about a couple of different things .
Btr002_1707	ar	Wasn't that a kick ? ; No ! ; I did that . ; No .
Bro028_1047	s	And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting the the , uh the feature selection thing , ; it 's a simple method , ; but I kinda like it . ; Um , there 's a a old , old method for feature selection .
Bmr024_226	s	He didn't even reply to my message . ; So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it . ; Alright . ; So , we have a whole bunch of digits ,
Bmr010_1290	%--	No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; So , I I think we have to start
Bro014_531	%--	Work to do . ; Uh - huh . ; So whose VAD ; is Is is this a ?
Bro021_807	s	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; They all need some some noise noise spectra ; No , I do that two t did two time .
Bmr024_276	%--	So with the new transcriber I 'm ; um ; So ; Uh , lemme say that my ,
Bed003_1400	s	How deep do we want to sear , ; you know ? ; Um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , ; so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve .
Bmr014_576	b	Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient . ; There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr029_879	d	Right . ; and you won't get very very clean models from them , anyhow . ; So . ; So you think it 's OK , then ?
Bed013_411	aa	I 'm ; Did Ben harass you ? ; OK . ; Yes .
Bmr008_1221	b	You know , and so there are various things you negotiate . ; And I 'm I 'm wondering if we might be able to do it s in sort of a loose way , but e with by having a searchable field like " role " ; and then you know " within this context this person has the following roles " , and it could be very loose , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_476	s	Maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , ; and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the you know , uh enumerated , or i ; Mm - hmm . ; it 's not a good way of saying
Bmr031_1681	s	But they didn't tell her . ; " Hey , I caught one this one and it 's already cooked ! " ; It you know , to keep to keep us , uh ; It 's already dead .
Btr002_1814	s	Let 's not make things hard on ourselves later . ; I know . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . Well and then , you know , there are these other things that I think are really interesting ,
Btr001_720	s	Yeah . ; Don't have it just start , ; yeah . ; I always wonder about the , um , time bins .
Btr001_2309	b	Yeah . ; You can also end an utterance with , uh , " blah - blah - blah ; but I don't know " . ; Hmm .
Btr002_591	b	um , by filtering in some of the older phones . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's why , like he ; Hmm .
Bed003_1030	aa	We - That 's alright . ; I can probably double cli click on it . ; Or ; Yeah , right .
Bmr010_1169	s	OK . ; Right ? ; OK . ; So it it 's got its own objective criterion .
Bmr031_916	aa	have never gotten a response from from any of the emails about , uh permission forms . ; So . ; Are they from one of the foreign - language ones ? ; Yep .
Btr002_1522	s	Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Oh . That 's interesting . ; I haven't paid attention to the numbers .
Bro010_848	%--	yeah , ; so I was using EM to get the targets . ; So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . ; And then he uses , uh , i u and then feeding into that are
Bro012_1397	bk	But the problem is that their models are all word level models . ; So there 's no phone models that you get alignments for . ; Mm - hmm . ; Oh .
Bro023_1517	%--	What what I what I d uh , I do actually , is to take a bunch of to take a tile on the spectrogram ; and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide . ; Mmm . ; And this tile
Bmr001_362	s	Um , we don't have headsets though . ; Yeah . ; We have the um the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC . ; Oh , OK so we just have to c wander around and collect them up .
Bmr024_985	s	Well ; Yeah . ; It 's like like dynamic ra DRAM . ; Just before .
Bmr012_203	s	if it was twenty minutes in then I don't know ; I thought ; Well , I mean , they ; Well it was interesting ,
Bmr031_1042	b	I 'm ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr020_878	b	Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way . ; Excellent . ; So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , now more or less know how to generate the file ; OK .
Bed012_267	s	I don't see a manufacturer on it . ; Oh , wait , ; You w ; here it is .
Bmr024_1629	s	No . ; I haven't done it . ; OK . ; So , uh , the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines ,
Bed011_691	%--	Obviously taxis are very different than buses , ; but on the other hand the system doesn't have any public transport This the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet . ; So this granularity would suffice , I think w if we say the person ; probably , based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude
Bro024_1926	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah , ; I 'll I 'll borrow the head back and and agree . ; Yeah ,
Bro027_1505	s	No , well , that 's a good idea . ; I I ; i Yeah . ; We just want to show .
Bmr026_516	b	Right . ; but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works . ; I mean does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and ; Yep .
Bro013_349	s	and we if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work , ; because on the server side features you already have LDA applied from the f from the terminal side ; and so you accumulate the delay ; so the VAD should be before the LDA
Buw001_2012	s	Like the , um , dominance relations of the people in the meeting . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; On the task , and the task .
Bro003_1322	aa	Right , right . ; Yeah . ; More classes . ; Yeah .
Bed016_522	%--	Metonymy and metaphor here , ; right ? ; uh , the individual , ; we 'd talked about putting in something about people had ,
Bmr016_2207	%--	have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted , uh , p on a per channel ; Uh , for for a total of like twenty m ; f for a total of ; Let 's see , four times
Bed013_957	s	discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance , is a good indication . ; Mm - hmm . ; So ; we don't want a hard code , a set of lexemes , or things , that person 's you know , sort of filter , or uh search the discourse history .
Bed005_986	g	Hey ! ; I was envying you and your pocket ; cause I don't have one . ; It was a quick one , huh ?
Bro024_1557	bk	Yeah . ; And ; wha what I observed is that for Italian and Spanish , when you go to thirty and twenty - five DB , uh it it 's good . ; OK .
Bro003_341	s	you talk on the phone , ; and it sends features out . ; OK , ; so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is .
Bmr008_1116	%--	Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ? ; Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to uh , things that have that bear on the content or the status relations , would be the things ; Without being exhaustive , by any means , ; but just like I said , if there 's a k a certain topic that comes up in the meeting , and that knowing their relationship will clarify it , or if there 's a certain dynamic that comes up
Bed003_973	br	Mm - hmm . ; No it doesn't , actually . ; Yeah . ; What ?
Bed008_1077	s	and then what 's the discourse history give us . ; Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes . ; Mm - hmm . ; That 's uh two things then .
Bro014_1223	b	Yeah . ; I have the mean . ; Well , I mean for the the energy . ; Right .
Bmr018_1611	b	simpler . ; Right ? ; Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well ; Mm - hmm .
Bns002_1262	s	and I guess that somebody at a certain meeting said " OK , why don't we have a l an extended range version , ; so we could re - use the same technology for other purposes , ; different than the original ones . " ; So , em , uh , I have the feeling that this is u this is what is uh introducing some confor confusion in the in the Bluetooth
Bmr020_1885	bk	Oh well . ; Yeah . ; I mean , it 's the same problem as the lapel mike . ; Yeah .
Bro004_482	s	You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ? ; Yeah . ; It 's uh the one hundred number . ; It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline .
Buw001_320	b	Mm - hmm . ; It may not be kept in the later summary , ; but at that point in time is was something that was important . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr015_334	b	Yep . ; Or " this is way too general " , ; and the other reviewer says , " this is way too specific " . ; Yeah .
Bed015_1425	b	Yeah . ; So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , " in France such - and - such happens " . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bsr001_2181	b	I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC . ; No , ; yeah . ; Yeah ,
Bro005_1277	s	We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path ; and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January ; some point ; uh , we say , " OK we we have shown that we can improve this , in this way .
Bmr027_1055	bk	No , these are ours . ; Oh . ; The transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version . ; Oh , I see .
Bmr024_148	b	Into two pieces . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , and I I dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback ; Yep .
Bmr012_1104	bk	cuz ; so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen ; and there 's six on the table ; Right .
Bro012_673	bk	so maybe I can ask you some questions . ; Oh . ; So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday . ; OK .
Btr002_1898	b	Yeah . ; I was like , " I don't know if you 're saying " a " or " uh " anymore " . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro005_1026	s	So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . ; Assume that 's the p the feature . ; look at these different ways of combining it . ; And uh , take let 's say , just take uh multi - English
Bmr022_563	b	Mm - hmm . ; Well l I guess what I 'm thinking of is that w that a lot of times there will be they 'll put in question marks , that represent some unknown amount of speech , ; Or ? ; Right .
Bmr020_695	bk	He still has his Unix account here , you know . ; He does ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah
Bro011_262	aa	so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts ; Uh I I 'm ho ; between the distant ; Right .
Bro022_115	cc	Um , build the intermediate classifiers . ; Uh , do phoneme recognition . ; Look at the errors . ; And then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories .
Bmr021_805	%--	and this this was fifty - two point six . ; and fifty - one point three ; Hmm . ; and then , when I combined them
Bro015_165	s	Uh , disk crash and uh covering things . ; u ; OK . ; This may be a very short meeting .
Bro027_1939	aa	Which is ; yeah . ; Right ? ; Yeah .
Bmr005_482	s	and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And I I found that eh another thing .
Bns001_1006	s	in a cookie and from the WAP gateway ; then it will be HTP real HTP or something . ; So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection . ; It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML ,
Bro021_241	b	but ; It 's it 's something that yeah , that affects more or less the silence portions ; because ; Mm - hmm .
Bro004_1189	s	Mmm . ; And the LDA introduces delays , ; and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path ; so that it doesn't introduce uh , any more delay .
Bro011_108	b	Try try what ? ; So try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . ; OK . ; Mmm .
Bed008_1146	b	Since ta they will still have three . ; EVA . ; Each so you 're uh uh from each point of view you 're making the same decision . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_2342	s	which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk . ; So , I notice people going , " Pfft " you know , if they 're trying to say something is done . ; Mm - hmm . ; The Germans do this I think in particular .
Bmr015_476	b	Mm - hmm . ; there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things . ; Right . ; Yep .
Bmr008_1776	%--	Signed . ; Yeah , cuz I think in I mean , in general F - seek works , ; I I I don't know ; so it 's
Bmr024_1025	no	I dunno what the these tapes ; uh , ; at some point these ; I dunno .
Btr001_1601	s	Mm - hmm . ; I That 's just how I am . ; But , like I ; I think I really , like , think of it in terms of re - transcribing it almost
Bro003_1010	ar	Um . ; Now , this is turning into a four - dimensional cube ? ; Or you just add it to the features . ; No .
Bro003_950	s	Yeah ; something like seven things in each , uh each column . ; So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , different systems that are going to be developed . ; There 's three of you .
Bmr006_854	qw	Sure . ; Yeah . ; Is your silence category pure silence , or ? ; What if there was a door - slam or something ?
Buw001_903	s	Oh , OK . ; So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? ; Yeah . ; So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it ,
Bro005_1457	s	uh um ; connect the ; My battery is low . ; Well , let 's hope it works .
Bmr010_327	b	Right . ; Yeah . ; And and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_1098	s	uh , Idaho ? ; Well there are hardly any subjects from Idaho . ; Montana ? ; No problem .
Bro012_1304	s	as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based ; Mm - hmm . ; uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one , ; and uh then you only use for this one distinction .
Bed008_37	bk	so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . ; So I didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet ? ; Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff . ; Great .
Bmr022_1095	s	I had another thought . ; So th I don't think that 's a good solution . ; Would w would it be possi ; There are scripts that uh , run ,
Bro027_1175	t1	Mmm ; Yeah , I mean , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set . ; Hmm . ; On the test set , yeah .
Bmr010_718	%	Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course . ; And then just close enough so that you get good volume . ; So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_596	aa	Yeah , it 's actually , um , it uh it was trimodal , actually ; Oh , was it trimodal , OK . ; trimodal , ; Yeah .
Bmr014_538	%--	But she knew that she didn't know it . ; Maybe it was a technical ter ; exactly . ; But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you
Bro026_103	b	Yeah . ; Uh . ; Yeah , for this stuff I don't think we 're quite up to that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro024_1901	s	Uh ; So if ; So you really might wanna try the clean I think . ; Yeah , I I I will have to look at it .
Bmr008_347	s	and if they say I don't want to give it say OK . ; In in like the London - Lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact . ; Yeah . ; So they say , you know , uh middle thirties , you know fifties or sixties ,
Bmr010_566	bk	Well , u uh , IBM was going to . ; Um ; Oh , OK . ; Oh .
Bed010_181	bk	Right . ; keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues . ; Hmm . ; Oh OK .
Bed005_29	s	OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , ; not necessarily by any means all students ; but we 'll s we 'll start with with that . ; In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script .
Bmr016_1632	ba	OK well ; Wh - the self - referential aspect of these these p ; I 'm wai ; Yes , it 's very bad .
Bmr012_684	h	I told you about that . ; Exactly . ; Um oh . ; Well OK
Bmr030_395	b	Oh . ; so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them . ; So one of the things that we did is , Adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want , uh , basically , uh , chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty - five minutes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr003_2220	s	OK , ; good . ; Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this . ; So , we it 'll have to be convention .
Bro010_468	b	I guess it 's power domain , yeah . ; I don't remember exactly . ; I don't remember . ; Yeah ,
Bmr002_1056	s	Actually what I would have come up with was w w " What was the web address of that thing " , ; Send m So , if you could just email me them . ; which we didn't ; Yeah , except we didn't record .
Bmr012_1220	bk	and ; Right . ; Um Gotta go . ; Off you go ,
Bro013_560	s	Yeah . ; Well , you probably want ; I mean , certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . ; Each each feature is by itself not enough .
Bro027_290	b	I I don't remember yet . ; Uh , I 'll I 'll d I 'll double check that and ask him again . ; Yeah . ; Hmm .
Bmr030_341	s	Right . That 's the same software I used to get the data . ; Yeah . OK . ; OK . ; I I gave you a c couple examples ,
Bro004_561	s	So . Um , ; oh I well , wait a minute . ; You have this here , for the Italian . ; That 's right .
Bsr001_1332	bk	No , but No but , y ; But it 's like , you know , if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say , " Oh , perhaps the computer could show us this . " ; And you 'd be talking to someone else ; but the computer 's meant to be listening , and so saying , " Oh ,
Bns002_1269	s	So , uh some people , I think , is being tempted to think that Bluetooth could provide them uh , some kind of local connectivity , ; but uh for for data for computing uses . ; Eh , however , I think that the that the When you have tried uh current eh standard eh working devices , you you ; working at at eleven megabits per second , you cannot you cannot switch to another thing , to another slower thing .
Bro026_485	b	yeah . ; Yeah . ; But I don't think the storage is so big for that . ; Right .
Btr002_2554	%--	Yeah . ; " Hmm . " ; Yeah . ; Or
Bro019_287	g	I don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console TTY , ; so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something . ; You probably wouldn't ordinarily , though . ; Yeah . Right ?
Bro022_774	ar	So removing more than that might still make a difference in the results . ; And ; Do we ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? ; No .
Btr001_1138	ba	Oh , I see . ; That 's why I was a little late today ; Wow . ; You did really well .
Bed015_372	s	those could intersect with these ; in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions . ; Right . ; And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way .
Bmr031_900	s	but it 's , you know ; it 's more than a ; And so these right here have been through the double - check . ; These haven't .
Bed008_205	t1	but I but uh ; I just accidentally ; And and and I think actually uh ; Oops .
Bmr020_642	b	Nigel Nigel Ward . ; Do you know him ? ; Uh - huh . ; Sure .
Bmr007_182	s	And ; Yeah , exactly ! ; Exactly ! ; Well , there you go .
Bro019_1178	%--	Unvoiced . ; Well . ; and to to concat this new feature . ; But the result are
Bmr014_12	co	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; We didn't have a front - end meeting today . ; And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused .
Bsr001_1028	s	I I belie I believe there is a lot of overlap ; There i ; yeah , indeed . ; so it would be nice to work together .
Bed005_1090	s	so we don't need to specify any probabilities . ; We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? ; So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? ; and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ?
Btr002_483	s	like , they maybe think , " Well , I hear it just as clearly ; I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly ; and I realize it 's not Jane , ; and I realize it 's not a female even ,
Bed005_220	bk	You want to get it ? ; Or is di was it easy to get it ? ; Um . I have no net here . ; Oh , OK .
Bro027_27	s	Yeah , it 's it 's interesting . ; I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , ; and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . ; Uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio
Bmr003_1883	ba	Oh , man . ; Ooo ! ; He 's committed himself to something . ; Ow .
Bro019_625	%--	Oh yeah , ; I mean the the new LDA filters . ; The new . ; I mean
Bro023_1270	b	But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some . ; I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same , ; but I would imagine it would help some . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr020_1205	ar	You got it . ; And because ; But after we 've done Thilo 's thing . ; No .
Btr001_2245	s	but ; That 's true . ; Is that right ? ; Ending with " so " .
Bmr012_695	%--	Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there . ; Yeah . ; Great . ; Right now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so I will
Bmr014_436	%--	Oh that 's great . ; cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . ; That was what I was always planing on . ; So that , you know you get a whole long list
Bmr013_560	x	" hmm " " OK " , " uh " Grunts , ; uh , ; that might be interesting . ; He 's got lip lipsmacks .
Bmr029_509	s	but it seems to me that that the speaker ; the the level of degradation that you get from having the distant mike in a normal acoustic is much greater than what you get from , say , not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation . ; I think that the ; I mean , we 'll see .
Bro014_1498	%--	It 's ; Yeah . ; That way there 's lots of work to do . ; So it 's
Bdb001_291	s	Right . ; So that what 's nice about the P - file It i ; Built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that sort of thing , that structure . ; And then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values .
Bed008_1418	bk	Right , so I mean the way you desc ; W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , ; couldn't you ? ; OK .
Bmr005_976	s	OK . ; It was the morning one . ; but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys . ; Jerry .
Bed015_1788	qy	the hedges paper ? ; Yeah . ; I read some of that paper actually . ; Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ?
Bmr008_1325	s	OK ? ; Good , OK . ; So um so I had two thought just glancing through this . ; So , one is one is that um that uh we might wanna talk about normalization .
Bmr013_949	d	That 's very important . ; I have to run it . ; Right . ; In in doing the hand - marking ?
Bed014_1012	co	And , you know , of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway and sometimes we do it in that room . ; Yeah . ; So , you know , I mean . ; OK , so l forget about the b the camping thing .
Bns003_943	s	and ; it 's a pity that Multicast is , in principle , removed ; and we do not have any expert from Multicast anymore . ; And , uh , that 's makes very hard , I believe .
Bed014_152	%--	If we get that , then it 's doable , ; even without getting into it , even though the Scheme li uh , stuff is really well documented in the Festival . ; Well , I guess if you 're not used to functional programming , Scheme can be completely incomprehensible . ; Cuz , there 's no
Bro021_925	bk	Mmm . ; uh , log E is equal , oh , to log of X plus N . ; Uh , and ; Yeah .
Bmr006_36	b	Is it ; Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up . ; Um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data ; Yeah .
Bmr014_51	b	Touching . ; uh , it it could be a number of things . ; It could be touching and fiddling , ; Yeah .
Btr002_1173	aa	OK , so i ; It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute ; and then I sorta get used to it . ; Exactly , exactly .
Bro018_1203	s	Yeah , ; I mean , as helpful ; I mean , ; so that 's the question .
Bmr006_1379	b	Well ; Mm - hmm . ; Yep . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr025_526	b	So if ; So . ; Right . Well I I just realized I hadn't been doing it ; Yep .
Bmr024_1394	s	I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , ; and and , well , we 're making sure that low and high ; Actually , there is the difference in that . ; So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes .
Bmr019_1418	s	Yep . ; I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round , ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's very specific .
Btr001_1311	b	I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one . ; So this was earlier on . ; So do I have a Tigerfish one right now ? ; Hmm .
Bed017_262	aa	and uh ; because , um , ; i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ? ; Yeah .
Bmr007_924	s	Yeah . ; Do something . ; Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . ; But his his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also .
Bmr025_991	bd	Hmm . ; That reminded me of something . ; Oh well , ; too late .
Bmr018_195	s	I I could set someone on that tomorrow . ; Right . ; OK . ; And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try .
Bed005_592	b	So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together . ; OK ? ; And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr005_1251	s	But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . ; I mean , that was sort of our goal . ; The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . ; And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester .
Buw001_840	%	But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , uh , subsets of that . ; Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , ; Of the board . ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1646	%--	Yeah . ; But it seems like to have it it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined rather than taking s you know , maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix and seeing if if it 's promising with respect to that type of analysis . ; w ; If you take like a target speaker , and maybe
Bmr023_747	s	and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it . ; Hmm . ; So we 're just getting better signals in in this data . ; Which is nice .
Bns003_230	co	I would what I would like to have is that um , your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here . ; And that means really to the project proposal itself and also maybe to the USAIA architecture , ; in that sense , that at certain stages , cuz it 's a general architecture , certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks , that it is related to these kind of things . ; Um , having uh , I what I have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system .
Bmr022_994	b	Right . ; Uh , little later on in the year . ; And so , we 're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed017_134	s	and ; I sorta constructed a couple of classes . ; Like , a user class , a site class , and and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class . ; And I tried to simplify it down a little bit ,
Bro028_446	b	but it but but the thing is that if you um , if you detect that there 's periodic s strong periodic components , then you can use a voiced voice thing . ; Oh . ; Uh - huh . ; Yeah .
Bns001_1801	s	Do not Don't switch it off . ; OK , ; yeah , that 's right . ; So maybe I will find him @ @ .
Bmr028_1116	%--	That 's great . ; That 's interesting . ; you know , it could be useful for lots of things " . ; So , we have to
Bro027_1558	s	Mm - hmm . ; I think you were . ; Yeah . ; Does something .
Bdb001_228	%--	um ; Anything at frame - level you had better encode binary ; or it 's gonna be really painful . ; Or you just compre
Bmr021_869	s	Hmm . ; um , there 's some room for improvements , I figure , in this in the ICSI front - end . ; Um . So . ; But the good news is that even with this with the ICSI system being that much worse , you still get a win out of combining the two .
Bed015_1274	s	So , uh , what this is , ; let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . ; OK . ; OK , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context ,
Btr002_357	b	Yeah . ; n Yeah . ; Even if you can't fully understand the word , you can make a guess , you can that isn't completely off like some of these are , ; Right .
Bmr024_765	aa	Are ? ; OK . ; So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ? ; Yeah .
Bed008_570	g	Right . ; And ; OK , shouldn't I be able to move them all ? ; No .
Bmr028_1370	s	you can do experiments , ; but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box . ; And it 's not a very smart system . ; It it only knows what we give it .
Bdb001_861	g	Whereas if we just do a flat file format , sure , it may not be as efficient ; but everyone can program in Perl and and use it . ; OK . ; Right ?
Bed014_974	qw	Interesting . ; Ah , yeah . ; So you 're proposing that we meet Tuesday . ; How about that ?
Bmr007_1186	%--	We we we spent a a a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e we realized , " well , people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later " , and , how do you get around that ; OK . ; so in the consent form it says , well you we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're unhappy with , yeah . ; OK , and you can say
Bro023_883	%--	Yeah . ; So this is something I can still work on , ; So what does that mean ? ; but
Bro014_1251	b	Mm - hmm . ; and it would be a multiplication in in frequency domain ; so that would be like an addition in log power spectrum domain . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_765	s	Good . OK . ; Yeah . ; There 's something we should talk about later ; but maybe not just now .
Bmr026_1269	s	Uncle Bernie ; yeah . ; Yes sir . ; We 're just waiting for you to leave .
Bdb001_1058	b	Yeah , I 've been meaning to look at the ATLAS stuff again anyway . ; Great . ; So , just keep ; Yeah .
Bdb001_1262	s	d isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye um , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they ; You know what I mean ? ; Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help . ; But the problem is exactly as Adam said , that you get , you know , y you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow ,
Bns002_404	b	That means here that is uh within the transmission power . ; OK . ; So if I send an RTS , and get back , um , a CTS , then he is allowed to send data , right ? ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_1811	b	Yeah . Yeah . Seriously . ; Yeah . ; Your grandmother . ; Hmm .
Bro024_944	b	And then the final log energy that they that they get , that to the to that they add some random noise . ; Yeah , but again , that 's just log energy as opposed to filter bank energy . ; Yeah . ; Mmm .
Bmr013_1038	bk	Yeah , I thought they were . ; You bet . You bet . ; And they work very well . ; Yes .
Bro005_195	g	Yeah . ; So the " mismatch " just refers to the noise and and , uh microphone and so forth , ; Yeah . ; right ?
Bmr005_821	aa	OK . ; See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , ; because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , ; Right .
Bed003_236	s	And then we have the means that they should use . ; Right ? ; but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that ; along those lines .
Bns001_756	s	So . ; The I believe there is a lot of research work ; and also if you see the end - to - end scope of the internet , from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server , " correspondent node " , or whatever you call this destination , then you have certain kind of models , for instance , for the quality of service and all these kind of things . ; And then is UMTS only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology .
Bmr008_755	%--	They have information sort of like TIMIT ; I don't know it 's how well they categorized , ; but they had North Atlantic , Mid - Atlantic , and ; You know , Texas was definitely out on
Bed014_119	s	But Nancy doesn't . ; Hiring somebody . ; We w um ; The guy .
Bmr020_797	aa	And , Andreas , um , sampled ? ; They are ? ; I think so . ; Yeah .
Bmr016_513	s	Uh . ; Uh , ; Nein ! ; You scream it .
Bro024_331	s	Right , ; OK . ; I see . ; Bec - because I so this SmartKom task first off , it 's this TV and movie information system .
Bed015_739	s	Uh , so so I think that 's kind of nice to keep " focus " being an information structure term . ; " Stress " ; I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . ; So , um , like " stress " , th stress is kind of a pun on you might have like whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress .
Bed010_222	s	Mm - hmm . ; I speak into it and you hear it talk , ; OK . ; and I can sort of walk f through the information .
Bed016_1174	s	Mm - hmm . ; OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically . ; Wish you a good trip . ; All success .
Bmr012_771	s	Sure . ; We can try it . ; I I only downsampled them first cuz I was ; I mean that 's just one line that 's one line of code to comment at
Bro022_927	s	and and put them together . ; Yeah . ; Mmm . M Yeah . ; Something that that I 've used in the past is , um when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative .
Bdb001_510	bk	I I think if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , I mean , it would be crazy to do something s you know , separate that ; OK . ; Yeah , we might as well . ; Yep .
Bed014_286	s	Yeah , I didn't know about it until Robert told me , like , ; Yeah , I I ra I ran across it in I don't even know where , ; you know some just some weird place . ; And , uh , yeah , I I 'm surprised I didn't know about it
Bed010_535	bk	I mean , the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment , ; Oh , OK . ; but this is a a three language project : German , English , Japanese . ; OK .
Bmr005_340	x	Eh , I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic , ; but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh , I I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping ; I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events , ; to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature
Bmr009_1648	b	Yeah , don't Don't read the old one . ; Alright . ; The And the time is . ; OK .
Bmr006_1810	ba	Mm - hmm . Yeah . ; I think we have to think about w @ @ how . I think that this can't be decided today . ; yeah . Sorry . ; Yeah , OK , good point .
Bmr010_1465	s	Um ; I 'm not sure . ; I I thought about , uh , adding , uh , uh , another class too . ; But it 's not too easy , I think , the the transition between the different class , to model them in in the system I have now .
Bed013_1283	bk	Just " where is X " . ; Yeah . ; Just just " where is X " . ; OK .
Bro026_731	s	good . ; But they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think . ; OK . ; So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe .
Bro005_1368	bk	I wanna try having the arrows go both ways . ; And um , I 'm just gonna see if if that that better models um , uh asynchrony in any way ; or um Yeah . ; Oh !
Bmr018_1669	s	Yeah , that 's it . ; So , I mean , this was a very provocative slide . ; Yeah , so that 's one of the slides they put up . ; She put this up , and it was like this is this p people kept saying , " Can I see that slide again ? "
Bed014_557	aa	That 's not the one I sent you . ; The one I sent you was from GMD , out of a European CRUMPET . ; It was terrible . ; Agreed .
Bed002_351	s	We 'll see . ; And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , ; and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . ; So this is not something which we can actually monitor , now ,
Bsr001_1571	s	Um . ; That 's ; Oh , right . ; So so , I One question .
Bro024_292	aa	But I think the ideally , it seems to me anyway , that you you would wanna do the same thing in training as you do in test . ; But that 's that 's just , uh , a prejudice . ; And I think anybody working on this with some particular task would experiment . ; Right .
Bro004_1064	%--	And maybe for the Italian , for the TD TE on for Finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set . ; Yes , I don't know . ; That 's that 's so that 's a that 's a very good question , ; then now that it I understand it . It 's
Bmr003_2101	2	Uh , ; and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around ; so my model is to get a a a p piece of ; Sleeve .
Bmr015_1158	s	as I really try to not to detect those breaths ; which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region . ; Yeah . ; And they so they hopefully won't be marked in in those channel - specific files .
Btr001_214	b	Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ . ; What 's ; you 've studied some languages , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1023	s	No , with the Transcriber tool , it 's no problem . ; It takes a very long ti ; In the in ; Yeah just to load a transcription
Bed003_643	s	Huh ! ; It loves the Tango . ; Um . ; Well , that 's obviously just to do with our probabilities .
Bsr001_404	t3	I mean if if you want something really really nonintrusive , really nonintrusive , really something that ; Yeah , ; that you really get you really get animals like ; Fascinating !
Bmr009_1219	ba	yeah . ; How ; because if you don't know , then , you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally inept or something , ; Good .
Bmr024_229	s	So , we have a whole bunch of digits , ; if we wanna move on to digits . ; Actually , maybe I One one relate more related thing in transcription . ; So that 's the IBM stuff .
Bmr009_1474	aa	Yeah . ; We uh We done ? ; Yep . ; Yeah , that 's good .
Bro024_1454	aa	s ; So by uh , by by reducing the noise a a decent threshold like minus thirty DB , it 's like Uh , you are like r r reducing the floor of the noisy regions , right ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro019_526	%--	It was system one . ; So ; OK . ; we
Bmr012_501	aa	Yeah ; but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance ; Yeah . ; Yes .
Bro011_195	s	And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there ; in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something ; and in addition to ; They 're doing some noise removal thing ,
Bro019_1228	s	Phones . ; Oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm . ; Exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank .
Bmr009_255	s	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated .
Bro021_798	s	Or i ? ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; And also I did some experiment , uh , doing , um , a lying estimation of the noise .
Bmr012_678	s	right ? ; U um ; From the outside world or ; By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .
Bro010_103	s	Alright . ; Um , ; Yeah . ; Well , there is w one , um , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase .
Bro010_1217	s	Yeah . ; on re reverberation , ; um ; The first paper on this is gonna have great references ,
Btr002_1675	%--	I I 'm really ? ; Yeah . Cuz there are always people like , you know , talking bad about the transcribers , ; Oh , I 'm glad . ; and just making fun of u
Bed008_364	co	I think we can ; so that the belief - net itself has properties ; and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . ; So the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing ,
Bro003_884	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; And , um , ; with within the training corporas um , we 're , uh , thinking about , um , training with noise .
Bmr026_314	s	And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . ; So , we 're doing OK on backed up . ; We 're We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . ; So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical ,
Bmr022_1377	ba	Yeah . ; sometimes it 's multiple interpretations , ; and ; Good point .
Bro014_556	s	I don't know ; w Yeah . ; Uh , yeah . ; Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because the , um to make a good VAD you don't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features .
Bro004_1217	s	So um The question we 're gonna wanna go through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been ; if you look at what we 've been trying , ; we 're uh looking at uh , ; by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band
Bro005_461	%--	But ; that gives eighty - seven point one . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eighty - s
Btr001_90	aa	Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_450	bk	Well that 's what they 're starting up . ; OK . ; Yeah . No , I mean , that 's what all this is about . They they haven't done it yet . ; OK .
Bmr013_169	bk	but it was but it 's but I mean . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . Uh , but . But , uh , sort of pulling out all the stops . ; OK . ; s @ @ . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , ; Alright .
Btr002_298	b	but they couldn't really , you know ; And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash . ; Yeah . ; Yep .
Bed011_215	s	Now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting . ; So , all I 'm saying is i th there 's there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish . ; and I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh , ; you know And each person is only gonna do it once ,
Bro011_230	b	OK . ; maybe will be good result or bad result , ; we don't know . ; Yeah .
Bed015_929	b	is it all the same constructions ? ; Just with a different foc focus constituent ? ; Yeah , I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of , ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr009_321	s	Yeah . ; So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps , ; like but by hand , ; by cheating ,
Bmr006_767	b	Uh - huh . ; because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , ; Well , training , and validation . Sure . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr024_141	%--	Right . ; Yeah . ; And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely . ; Yeah , one interesting note is uh , or problem
Bro026_228	s	But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , ; because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . ; And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects ; but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard .
Bed011_41	b	or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever . ; Right , right . ; But I think that might be overdoing it a little . ; So Yeah .
Bmr022_1299	bk	and that 's what you work on . ; So , until you 're ready to check it in , nobody sees anything you 've done . ; And then when you check it in , it puts , sort of , you know every change that you 've done is goes into the central ; Right .
Bro014_981	b	so I I would almost take a ; uh , especially if if these trainings and so forth are faster , I would almost just take a uh , a scattershot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference ; and , uh , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro003_1570	s	Well , I 'll check on that . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , ; and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . "
Bed011_728	g	We can we can sort of uh , drive ; I would I would lump it with " walk " because hills matter . ; Yeah . ; Right ?
Btr002_1464	s	Oh . ; it would be underneath that little resolution bar ? ; I mean , it 's like in that u cluster up there ? ; Um , it 's not on the resolution part .
Bmr009_746	b	Mm - hmm . ; Well again for the close mike stuff , we could come up take a s take the Switchboard system or something , ; That might be good enough . ; Yeah .
Btr002_1346	s	Mm - hmm . ; than what it would be now , ; so . ; Actually , you you also did a different type of transcription i uh , with res respect to , um , our sister project ,
Bed013_1123	%--	Well ; And then given that we know that the construction has these two things , we can set up probabilities ; we can s basically define all the tables for ev for those ; Yeah , it should be So we have
Bmr024_408	s	I in Berkeley , yeah . ; So , uh You you have to go a little early , ; right ? ; Well , I can stay till about , uh , three forty .
Bed011_1165	s	Sure . ; Then you can go . ; I mean I I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment , ; but it probably is .
Bro024_1474	s	and then you simply add an additive constant again . ; Yeah . ; So you shift it somehow . ; This this whole curve is shifted again .
Bmr026_1029	s	It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . ; Because our our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . ; Mm - hmm . ; He knows .
Bro018_212	%--	Is that maybe that 's accuracy ? ; Percent . ; The accuracy . ; Fif - fifty - six percent accurate for v voice - unvoice
Bed015_564	s	There are sort of a relatively limited number . ; And then how they interact with some extra thing like " in France " or " if such - and - such " , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can ; Yeah . ; You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you .
Bmr019_348	s	because somebody gets on the phone and says a number ; and then you just want it . ; You don't don't , uh ; This is this that one 's better .
Bmr003_2486	aa	You 're kidding ! ; Well , the next conference they will . ; So . ; Sure .
Bed016_1006	b	" where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? " ; Or something . ; Uh , yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr019_1743	b	Yeah . Maybe somebody else will come along and will be , uh , interested in working on it ; and could start off from where you are also , you know . ; They 'd make use of of what you 've done . ; Yeah .
Bed004_622	%--	The h ; So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is ; OK . ; where are you gonna
Bmr022_1477	s	And the b the thing that makes it ea OK to do that , is knowing where the synch time boundaries are . ; Cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you 've only got twenty words or so in an utterance . ; It 's when you get the whole meeting ; and the synch times ch have changed ,
Bmr012_673	s	Which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted ; Yeah , well , so what I mean is ; um ; the uh the data that you take into SRI , first first question ,
Bro013_344	%--	and um , ; Mm - hmm . ; because it it ; well , this VAD
Bmr009_258	b	I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated . ; Yeah . ; Um And then we w I think we 're agreed that pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate to help . ; Yeah .
Bmr022_88	s	So I had two ideas . ; The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker I Ds . ; Yeah . ; You know , just " male - female " , " English - nonEnglish " , " one two three four " .
Bed010_656	s	Those are two - point . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .
Bmr028_1695	s	Yep . ; I really think it 's better not to transcribe a meeting that 's gonna have problems once you 've spent all this effort . ; Yep . ; The only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content . Content maps .
Bro003_323	%--	but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language . ; Hmm . ; Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call , ; and you know , I mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh ,
Bro014_1586	bk	Um , I was thinking more like using them as as the inputs to to the detectors . ; or a feature or something . ; Oh , I see . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1075	s	It 's already chunked . ; whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , ; they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk . ; And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary .
Bmr014_717	%--	And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , ; I mean unless you 're searching . ; Searching , of course , should be electronic , ; but if you 're not
Bmr002_477	b	Awesome . ; What I mean is it 's not necessarily monetary . ; But if they feel like they 're getting something out of it , sometimes you can do it that way . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_285	s	And , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . ; It 's , you know , cheap , easy . ; Uh . ; There 's a question about exactly how we do it .
Bed002_145	s	What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , ; gives us , um , high quality audio , ; um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . ; So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available .
Bmr024_1192	aap	It sai because uh , the meeting before , you said " OK , we got it down to where they 're they 're within a tenth of a percent " . ; That was on males . ; Right . ; That was that was before I tried it on the females .
Bro024_1746	b	that 's true . ; Yeah . ; Slightly better . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro014_500	s	Yeah . ; I think that that ; I I ; I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change
Bmr005_1050	b	Since it 's the same people over and over . ; Mm - hmm . ; to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far - field effects . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro015_55	s	Maybe . ; But this is still ; Yeah . ; Sounds like they 're still arguing .
Bns002_669	s	so we can reduce the not - used space for other simultaneous transmissions . ; And this will lead us to a a better to a better network throughput , to higher number of simultaneous transmissions . ; And , we have , uh mmm , worked about this problem uh , in two different uh ways . ; One of these ways has been try to find a mechanism to uh calculate an optimal value for the transmission range uh , and to get an equal value for all the transmitters .
Bro019_1342	%--	yeah . ; maybe higher - order cumulants ; Oh . ; and
Bed006_259	s	And um . ; So out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple , ; such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide " OK , I wanna do that at this place " , ; sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks
Bmr026_962	%--	Yeah . ; um because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News ; and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard ; or s uh and
Btr002_3239	b	put capital letters . ; Capital letter , capital letter , colon , apostrophe " S " , utterance . ; Oh ! ; Yeah .
Bmr008_1625	%--	I guess you 'd ; You can also look at just the voiced regions later . ; I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure . ; because you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um , you should be much more sensitive to the to the overlaps then if you
Bmr016_580	b	So these ; So , that 's about the summary ; But this is Morgan has this paper . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr028_1588	b	So , so i so , that 's interesting . ; Well , I wanted to raise the issue , ; and um , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr002_920	b	If I can see it if it 's if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear , ; Oh yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah . ; Right .
Bro023_1569	b	Um . ; So , u ; y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive ; Mm - hmm .
Bed010_1131	s	But um , ; I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a ; Yeah , right . ; It 's as if we didn't tell anyone at all ,
Bro027_1125	b	Mm - hmm . ; So it had like all these different conditions of S N Rs , actually in their training set of neural net . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm .
Buw001_953	bk	Yeah . ; It 's just ; Right . ; OK .
Bmr016_1934	s	Chuck pointed out that this is read speech , ; and it 's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other prob uh p uh , things . ; And that 's why there 's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now ; which is just well n n " NUMS " by itself
Bmr003_1331	%--	Good . ; Good . ; Oh , so multi multichannels . ; Multichannels was also
Bmr022_1445	s	and if they screw those up , that 's , you know , in their that 's only on them . ; Exactly . ; Mm - hmm . ; It 's w it 's the checking in part that r we really care about ,
Bed015_393	aa	Instead of just the meaning . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it . ; Right .
Bmr022_617	s	but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong . ; Right . ; You need some of the words in there , so that you can say " well , this segment matches this one , ; this segment matches this one ,
Bmr010_887	ar	So train a phone in the neural net ? ; Yeah . ; Yeah . You ha Oh . And each of these words has a dedicated phone . ; No
Btr002_3342	ba	Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ? ; Oh . Yes . ; Oh , but ; Good question .
Bed008_871	s	Oh yeah , ; true . ; So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff ; and then says here it 's either yep , yay , A , or nay .
Bsr001_801	b	And he has a very good system for that ; and and he wants to use this corpus . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr024_283	s	And , that sort of , um , is useful , ; and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . ; OK . ; Well , I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version ,
Bro027_708	aa	So I think , ; Mm - hmm . ; you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing , ; Yeah .
Bro017_864	b	right ? ; I mean y people will listen to it for for centuries now , ; is what you can do , is you train the model uh with the with the original data . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro026_161	d	And after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins . ; Mmm . ; And , uh ; So this is on the uh , before any mel scaling has been done ?
Btr001_1978	b	I agree , ; Yeah . ; it 's it 's really interesting , Also , ; Mmm .
Bmr003_728	ba	Yeah , we ; But if if there was a way to merge the two ; Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right ; That 'd be fun .
Bmr023_622	s	and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at ; because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them . ; Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns ; and we 're hoping that maybe with , I don't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results .
Bmr018_986	aa	Well , I think we 'll have to , eventually . ; I mean , it 's ; And my hope was that we would be able to use the forced alignment to get it . ; Right .
Bro014_781	t1	The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ? ; Yeah . ; Probably , yeah . ; I get it .
Bed013_17	s	I 'll be off to Sicily and Germany for a couple , three days . ; Now what are y what are you doing there ? ; I forgot ? ; OK , I 'm flying to Sicily basically to drop off Simon there with his grandparents .
Bro025_88	s	Hmm . ; Uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , I mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing
Bmr009_1645	co	Yeah , why don't you read the digits and then you can go . ; Oh , this is the new one . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , don't Don't read the old one .
Bro023_682	b	Yeah . ; So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction . ; O oh , OK . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr028_128	bk	OK . ; We should If you were having problems with the words , we should figure out why . ; I I 'll have done I 'm probably doing something wrong . ; OK .
Bro013_48	aa	Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . ; So there is ; It 's their complete system and including on - line uh unsupervised adaptation . ; That 's true .
Bed005_146	%	And we noticed that whatever we tried to do , it no effect . ; OK . ; And we were puzzled . ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_2036	s	First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , ; that it would be worthwhile doing . ; Mm - hmm . ; And that 's the other thing , that we don't have
Buw001_75	ba	Yeah . ; That 's good . ; OK . ; That kind of thing is good .
Bmr014_119	b	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Maybe . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1841	b	or it ; Yeah . It 's not the fact that you have like ; I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_672	s	OK . ; And so that that 's a minor part of it , ; I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text . ; So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um I would take them , and generate the web pages
Bed004_621	bk	So , the hardest problem is how are you going to get this information from some combination of the what the person says and the context and the ontology . ; The h ; So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is ; OK .
Bro021_1381	b	They prefer to have them on ; and the ; just so that they 're continuing to get the distant , uh , information . ; Yeah .
Bmr006_527	s	And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . ; Where did you copy it to ? ; Well , it 's Abbott . ; It 's Abbott , so it just But it 's it 's a lot of data .
Bmr008_1054	ba	Oh yeah , that 's bad . ; So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate . ; Thanks ; That 's interesting .
Bro010_520	b	but , mmm . ; Hmm ! ; Yeah . ; So .
Bed017_386	%--	and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . ; Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . ; One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document , ; and one is uh , you have sort of a , um ,
Bro011_359	bk	So how did he combine all these features ? ; What what r mmm classifier did he ; Hmm . ; Oh right .
Bns002_806	s	OK , ; but I 'm of course , I 'm also uh using a conservative value for the transmission speed , ; now you can get much more speed than speedier interfaces than this one , ; but the thing is , uh , that we are assuming that for a given transmission , we can uh consider the network as if it were built of a set of static nodes .
Bmr019_577	%	Th - we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a PDA . ; Yeah . ; So they are they 're not the PZM three hundred dollar type . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr016_1273	bk	Oh yeah , so i e this would ; Let 's just take one example . ; A comment , basically . ; Oh , oh , oh .
Btr002_1306	s	Very efficient , ; and really is , um I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins . ; Hmm . ; If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things .
Bro026_952	s	I don't I don't um , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with the way I 've been looking at it . ; That it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . ; But it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um , is bottom - up . ; You know , however we do that .
Bro021_591	s	Yeah . ; Also , I guess we had we 've had these , uh , little di discussions ; I guess you ha haven't had a chance to work with it too much ; about about , uh uh , uh m other ways of taking care of the phase .
Bmr027_1354	s	So . ; So . ; So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . ; I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people ,
Btr001_1212	%--	Ho - ho how Have you ; Oh . ; And so I think you Yeah , I think you Did you ; I don't think I have ever done one from an external
Bro022_356	co	I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . ; Um . ; Well , you know , there is this . ; Wait a minute .
Bmr024_1324	s	Sure . ; Um . ; Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set , ; It d if you if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that ,
Bns001_1683	s	you have to map it to IP addresses ; and and so on , ; but for me , you have not the end to end parts of for for IP functionality . ; We are far away from that .
Bmr012_1046	s	believe it or not ; and Sony only sells this headset . ; Mmm . ; So if we wanna use a different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end
Bmr009_975	no	You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great if you 're a linguist " . ; Yeah . ; Actually even if you t ; But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them .
Bmr025_794	s	How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? ; so . ; I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally ; and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads
Bmr002_589	2	but they 're pretty low level . ; They 're designed for um for phoneme - level ; Yeah . ; Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions .
Bed009_382	ar	Mm - hmm . ; It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's ; So , I mean there is this this this nice interf ; uh , No ,
Bro024_1440	bk	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; But this number . ; OK .
Bro024_1585	ar	Um ; Yeah , so I g ; But what he is doing language dependent is measuring what that number i reference is that he comes down twenty - five down from . ; No .
Bmr020_344	%--	Mm - hmm . ; And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully . ; We also fixed the transcripts in in numerous ways . ; Uh , but mostly we added one one number , which was
Bmr019_590	s	Right . ; You know , it 's ; They I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under , ; it 's just that there 's less quality control .
Bed013_1212	bk	and ; So un ; I change I changed my mind actually . ; OK .
Bmr016_169	s	But if they make mistakes , it 's no big deal ; if the people say a hundred instead of " one OO " . ; and also w maybe we can just let them choose " zero " versus " O " as they as they like ; because even the same person c sometimes says " O " and sometimes says " zero " in different context ,
Bmr022_1311	s	Because what if the uh , what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention . ; Mm - hmm . ; And the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly , was changing it the other way around . ; Then you could end up with a real mess ,
Bns003_222	s	Mm - hmm . ; And , um ; I I think it doesn't ; It is not worth to discuss it now
Bro012_697	co	Yeah . ; A boom . ; Well that that that 's OK . ; But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again ,
Bmr001_353	bc	Well . Five with wireless . ; So we could have eight . ; Yeah . ; Nine .
Bmr026_99	bk	I ; That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages ; and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll ; Oh , OK , OK .
Bed005_1121	bk	And so , you other guys can decide how interested ; Yeah , @ @ . ; Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard . ; OK .
Bns003_35	s	and based on the success , I think that 's always an ongoing process to go back to uh , to Germany for a couple of weeks ; and then come here and and go on with with this work ; and ; so that is my current opinion , concerning how Siemens deal with with my , uh , ongoing effort .
Bed005_1467	g	Yeah . ; I don't think I mean , the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that ; I mean , OK . ; So say it blows up , right ?
Bro016_270	s	for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit . ; But , ; once we knew what rou roughly the right operating range was , it was pretty stable , ; and Uh , we might just not even be in the right operating range .
Bed015_1117	%--	That 's not the same effect . ; Yeah , it 's a little bit it 's a little bit different . ; Right ? So ; Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive
Bro004_1345	s	And more are supposed to come soon ; and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . ; So I don't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , ; but uh Hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon
Bed003_788	s	Yeah , that 's true . ; Yeah ? ; uh , a statue or um ; So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's " enterable or not " .
Bns001_711	s	that is ; which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM . ; So , ; I mean . Uh , I don't see that a a lot of difference .
Bmr024_926	s	Yeah . ; Well , ; th th OK . ; Ninety - one ,
Bmr011_1046	s	Adjusting . Oh . ; so . ; Yeah . ; And aft after a minute or so it 's it 's way better .
Bmr001_280	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Well , we 're getting some we we 're getting some right now . ; Depends on who 's working on it .
Bmr031_497	%--	Yep . That 's wh that 's what I thought . ; Yeah . ; So so ; So , uh , I th I I think it 's it 's , uh
Bns002_1549	%--	You never heard from him ? ; No . ; I don't know . ; You can I you can mail him later on the informa
Bro028_1062	ba	So , um , uh , ; here at least you 're starting off with all of them , ; and you 're throwing out useless features . ; I think that 's that seems , uh that seems like a lot better idea .
Bmr016_1337	aa	Hmm . ; And so then we 'll have everything following these conventions . ; But you notice it 's really rather a small set of these kinds of things . ; Yeah .
Bmr007_552	b	So technically , it 's an overlap . ; But you know , from information flow point of view it 's not an overlap in the predictable information . ; But maybe a just a small overlap ? ; More , yeah .
Buw001_1740	fa	Oh , excellent . Good . ; And then p possibly ; I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . ; I should have sent I should have CC ' ed you as well .
Bns003_571	aa	and either you will go back to KPN or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company , ; is that right ? ; Yes , ; yeah .
Bmr014_1187	b	No , I 'm serious . ; So the so i the ; so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was , you know , not not really what I said . ; Yeah .
Bmr011_1132	s	Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? ; Um , I 'm sure I have some ; February sixteenth I think . ; but but that 's the one where we 're , um , trai training on ,
Btr002_2745	s	" Well , there must be something there , um , whether I can hear it or not . " ; Right . Right . Exactly , exactly . ; Oh , yeah . I 'm sure they are . ; So , they just say , " Well , it 's a breath then " .
Bro003_785	s	and ; There 's a ; It 's , uh , French French . ; French French .
Bmr003_894	b	That 's all . ; Exactly . ; Uh , which is fine . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_590	bk	er , uh , I could send him that if it would be possible , or a good idea or not , to try to do a s forced alignment on what we 're on the way we 're encoding overlaps now . ; Well , just talk to him about it . ; Yep . ; Good .
Bro026_716	s	And there are noises that are different from the noises used on TI - digits . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . I mean , I wouldn't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge . ; They probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too .
Bmr023_666	s	Start . ; Yeah , ; uh , we didn't try it , ; Yeah . There 's all these things to do .
Bro003_1873	aa	Well , they they they 're going actually the the other way , defining uh , phoneme clusters , apparently . ; Well . ; Aha . ; That 's right .
Bed012_820	aa	And , um , ; Does th th does the H go b before the A or after the A ? ; Oh , in my name ? ; Yeah .
Btr001_2081	bk	cuz there are these m special lights that have to stay on all the time ; Oh . ; Oh . ; Oh .
Bmr026_840	s	Mm - hmm . ; And so , uh . ; But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . ; And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .
Bro005_882	%--	Mmm . ; Um . ; Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment , ; in fact ,
Btr002_2556	no	Yeah . ; Or ; Hhh . ; I i I don't know .
Bro003_403	s	Yeah . ; And that way you can say , " Well , " you know , " we 're gonna build it for what we think are the most common ones " , ; but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , " here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . " ; Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't .
Bmr003_998	b	So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard . ; Everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_1346	%--	Yeah . ; Right ? ; Y yeah . ; And and wouldn't
Bsr001_2589	s	Oh , I see . ; Perfect . ; See , you may wanna call up your computer . ; " Computer ,
Bed014_700	cc	and I think he 's right , is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself all the synonyms and all you know , all the wo ; Uh ; maybe . ; I 'll have to think about that .
Bmr030_80	%--	uh , ; Was it with Susan Ervin - Tripp ? ; I don't remember . ; It might have been .
Bmr024_373	b	I mean , you think they 'll we 'll get ? ; It 's pretty distinct . ; The beeps are pre - recorded . ; Yeah ?
Bsr001_596	aa	So ; Huh . ; uh . ; Yeah .
Bed012_625	b	basically , what where we also have decided , prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together ; OK . ; sometime this week again ; OK .
Bmr003_820	fa	If we 're just doing silence detection ; I knew you were gonna do that . ; Just saw it coming . ; I 'm sorry .
Bmr024_25	2	SmartKom ? ; Uh , we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus . ; The data . ; The data which we are collecting here .
Bsr001_1128	b	OK . ; And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Btr002_362	s	those things , the f ; Mm - hmm . ; the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare ; I think , so .
Bed015_2185	bk	Friday ? ; Fri ; Thursday 's my last day here . ; OK .
Bmr014_1148	b	my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . ; You know , if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that . ; Oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh i segment a against some personal i th ; Right .
Btr002_1097	s	I I 'm not sure which one is which . ; Or no ! ; Yeah . ; I just get used to it .
Bmr031_963	s	Question is , when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days ; so that I can do it ; and if it doesn't work , we won't impact people . ; Well , there 's a point when a bunch of us are off at Eurospeech .
Bsr001_2474	b	That 's like the TIMIT sentences . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr019_1799	%--	or ? ; You eh ; Uh , I 'm sorry ? ; Ye - ye you prefer , eh , to eat , eh , chocolate , eh , at the coffee break , eh , at the ? Or you prefer now , before after ?
Bro014_1286	s	So what is it ? ; And then you go back to the intuition that , ; well , you don't really get the excitation , ; but you get something related to it .
Bmr028_401	bk	I was trying to remember ; Oh , darn . ; I haven't done that yet . ; Er OK .
Bmr023_1143	s	Well , you actually are . ; But but it but in an indirect way . ; Well , right . It 's indirect , so you don't know ; So wha w what an and you may not be in this case ,
Bmr031_399	b	Yeah . ; CD - ROM . ; CD . ; Yeah .
Btr002_270	%--	A new subject . ; Yeah , less ; Right , yeah . ; The first one , too , is more like
Bmr010_1419	aa	Yeah , I didn't think so . ; He on only train ; Oh , OK . So he 's just he just computes a Gaussian over potential ; Yep .
Bro019_1467	s	Oh . ; OK . ; And then , you 're coming back uh ; Uh , i I mean , I I p I plan to be here on thirty - first .
Bro005_253	t3	I don't know . ; It 's not ; So , s ; Do you have this result with PLP alone , j fee feeding HTK ?
Bmr019_49	b	With with whatever it was , a month and a half or something ahead of time , the only time we could find in common roughly in common , was on a Saturday . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; Ugh .
Bmr018_1586	aap	Well ; well that 's getting cl ; I mean , ; yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true ,
Bed009_684	aa	And then extend it to an arbitrary number of applications eventually . ; So wouldn't ; That 's an additional reason to have this well - defined interface ; Oh , yeah , yeah .
Bro016_739	%--	I don't know . ; I cannot tell . ; But ; It 's it
Btr001_2731	aa	But in the transcriptions I mean , we don't have to deal with that ; because when the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever . ; No . ; That 's right ,
Bmr010_636	s	Does anyone , like , know stores ; or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ? ; Oh , I probably would . ; I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date
Bro010_207	s	and so I think of it as complementary , ; that if we can put the ; Think of it as what ? ; Complementary .
Bed008_151	s	Thrift , that 's good . ; Great . ; There it is . ; Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff .
Bns001_1604	s	I 'm out for th one a week and a half . ; So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop at Stanford ; OK . ; and next week I have a week on holiday .
Bmr026_406	qw	Um not that I can't do anything , I jus ; Uh And uh ; So but that But ; Which one was that , X G ?
Bro012_340	s	And if it 's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations , um , you know , we should be able to get a lot more experiments done . ; Hmm . ; And so . I 'll let you know what what happens with that . ; But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done .
Bed015_626	b	like two uses that come to mind immediately . ; One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . ; So " hypotenuse " , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle . ; Mm - hmm .
Bns001_499	s	Yeah . ; And the building blocks , ; yeah . ; Multicast , not a topic .
Bed008_442	bk	Yeah , so let 's do that . ; No no , no eh to to an inter no , an intermediate node . ; T ; Oh , OK .
Bed011_586	s	OK . ; Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel , ; so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think . ; You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something ,
Bed011_68	s	So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up , ; and , the kinds of decisions . ; So the uh uh on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . ; So if if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions ,
Bed011_1106	b	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , yeah . ; Right .
Bro021_1187	s	Eh , this is the composition of the dictionary . ; Mm - hmm . ; This one thing . ; And the other thing that this with these methods is to , uh , obtain to calculate this value .
Bed006_761	s	You look up here . ; OK . ; Sort of between here and here , ; so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um " Struct " , if you want , IE a rich action description on that level .
Bmr008_78	b	How fine a resolution do you need on that for this ? ; Is the question . ; I mean maybe not so much . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_1573	s	and Uh , ; well , they are mainly stationary . ; Um . ; But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits
Bed015_649	bk	Yeah , yeah . ; I I mean , I I was a little bit surprised about it too . ; I knew that ; Yeah .
Bed005_1323	s	because they 're having really trouble getting the upper level straight , ; and ; right now . ; The reason is , given the craw bet uh , the the the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and , on all history , they 're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects ,
Bro025_626	%--	Uh , it 's like ; Can you use the same net to do both , ; or ? ; For
Bed002_1237	s	I 've downloaded them both , ; and I started to unpack the Linux one ; Uh , the NT one worked fine . ; and I started unta pack the Linux one ,
Bns003_327	%--	So , some information for people who are new comers or , ; I don't know a good word for it , ; should we use uh " new comers " ; or
Bmr027_273	qh	I don't know . ; Oh . ; You should be . ; Hello ? Hello ?
Btr001_1818	%--	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; um , m backchannels or whatever . ; And some people
Btr002_304	aa	but they don't say that . ; Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro005_1169	%--	and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is is is is is better . ; And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . ; But one way or another we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability that we 're gonna be covering . ; So that I 'm I 'm I 'm hoping that
Bmr008_1313	s	What about that error that that uh the the supposed lub ; The residual error ? ; no , the supposed bug that was that we were ; We were guessing you had a bug before
Bmr019_1146	b	Maybe it was Sue ? ; But , in any case , I think it 's a good term , ; Y ; Hmm !
Bro023_698	qw	even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , uh , uh , you know . ; So why did you choose , uh , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ?
Bmr011_1847	s	Mm - hmm . ; cuz what they had done there is align and then chop . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global .
Bsr001_2232	aa	I mean , s it tho those those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of of trying , ; But if there ; Robert 's rules . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_826	s	I don't think so . ; He says that uh in German " selbst " is used in two different ways ; so you have It either means uh " himself " or it means " even " ; and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation .
Bed012_968	b	There 's a bandwidth issue , ; right ? ; Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something . ; Yeah .
Bmr018_1486	s	Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked , ; but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about , ; Yep . ; uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative ,
Bro027_1213	s	I mean , the Macrophone data , um , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . ; Mm - hmm . ; And , um , ; so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions .
Bmr007_382	ba	Mm - hmm . ; and I 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that Jane described happen with more people present . ; So it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be . ; That 's an important question to ask .
Bro027_156	aa	So , um , ; I mean , the main the the ; So that 's on th that 's on the f the far field ones though , right ? ; Yeah ,
Bed006_1078	%--	whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in in nice ways . ; So it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas ; Mm - hmm . ; you know from the other
Bed013_358	%--	Um , what 's your input ? ; Well , um , I don't have much experience with uh , conference papers for compu in the computer science realm , ; and so when I looked at what you had , which was apparently a complete submission , I just sort of said ; what just
Bed013_1241	s	That 's that 's ; So , w ; So tha is that what you 're t talking about ? ; Exactly . We have su we have specified two .
Bed013_1188	s	It will be the same . ; So I think r in here we have " I 'll go there " , right ? ; Answers ? ; And we have our Info - on .
Bro005_1364	s	Mm - hmm . ; uh basically it was two H M Ms with with a with a dependency arrow between the two H M ; Uh - huh . ; And so I wanna try try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band .
Bed010_1053	%--	What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday . ; Sure . ; OK ? ; Uh , " these are the decisions "
Bro027_909	b	But we have to for sure , we have to go down , ; because the limit is now sixty features . ; So , ; Yeah .
Bro023_568	g	And they keep the speech pauses also . ; Um , ; and the overall improvement over the MFCC baseline ; So , when they just , uh , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r uh , forty percent , right ?
Bmr008_1779	s	so it 's ; Yep . ; I don't know ; but eh I I solved the problem with eh a similar way and I haven't problem
Bmr021_395	s	Start end . ; Yep , the way Feacalc calc does it . ; This is ; Right , the the only reason we do this is because the the SRI front - end doesn't have a way to to um go into a l a longer file with indices .
Bmr010_1000	qw	they 'll So one of them said " well , you know , he really said " n " , ; not really " and " , ; Yeah . ; so what what should I do with that ? "
Bmr002_1269	b	Mm - hmm . ; OK . ; ' You know , so right now we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr013_651	s	both . ; OK . ; Different different number of speakers , different speakers , different conditions . ; Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,
Bed010_710	s	Yep . ; Yeah . ; Yep . ; By the way , there something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .
Bro017_178	s	So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected , ; like noise separation . ; Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically , ; which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise ,
Bro022_366	s	Mm - hmm . ; So , it 's it 's just a a question of ; there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , ; or something
Bro017_992	b	just tuning the models and testing , actually . ; Yeah . ; recognitions . ; Yeah .
Bro008_484	b	We 're not we 're not used to work with this kind of data . ; Yeah . ; That 's why we should have a loo more closer look at what 's going on . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_388	s	Hmm . ; So things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a in a real recognizer . ; Mm - hmm . ; Like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the the the Aurora uh program .
Bmr028_438	s	because we all know we 're being recorded , whenever anyone says anything like that , we then have a conversation about bleeping it out . ; Right . ; We ; Yeah . You can search for " beep " or " bleep " .
Bmr015_1009	b	I I don't know , ; I mean we had this an ; and I didn't couldn't get back to you , ; Yeah .
Bed003_1445	s	right ? ; Mmm . ; Not direct . ; You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago .
Bmr024_701	s	I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . ; Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . ; That 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . ; And and those and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup .
Bns001_1414	s	because this the eh most difficult thing I see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align . ; So that 's why I was proposing this this question . ; Let 's assume we have the funding . ; Now let 's proceed .
Bmr026_1118	%--	Um . No . ; Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . ; Oh actually it 's not that weird ; because we have seen
Bro004_809	s	Mmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situations . ; But if you go to very very fine categories , it 's very binary .
Bmr025_384	b	Yeah , I mean I 'll be here . ; Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's ; cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , ; Yeah .
Bmr023_140	aa	Is is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ? ; We 're improving . ; We 're improving . ; Yeah .
Bro018_951	2	And if you had if you had fifty filters , you 'd be throwing away hardly anything . ; Mm - hmm . ; Um , I don't remember there being an independent way of saying " we 're just gonna make them from here to here " . ; Use this analysis bandwidth or something .
Bmr011_1200	s	Mm - hmm . ; Second was , uh , somewhat lower level ; just doing these more precise timings . ; And the third one is is , uh , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have
Bmr007_668	%--	I I have an idea . ; D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people . ; Right . ; Could we Could we , um
Bmr028_375	s	So there was a q question I had asked Adam whether it 's possible to search only for your own name your own utterances , ; so that you know you don't have to go through the whole meeting , ; and Um , ; and I didn't hear back .
Bro021_958	%--	What is , uh ? ; The the the log of X plus N is not the same as the log of E to the X plus E to the N . ; Yeah . ; But this i
Bed010_503	cc	OK , ; yeah , I mean . ; Transcribed . ; I will send you that .
Bed012_45	aa	So this is the situational context , everything in it . ; Is that what Situation is short for , ; shi situational context ? ; Yep .
Bmr005_873	bk	That was with zero literature search . ; And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it . ; That 's good validation . ; Yeah .
Bmr003_2159	%	Yeah . ; And to See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table . ; OK . ; Th
Bed003_753	aa	right ? ; Like ; Pretty much the same ? ; Yeah ,
Bed004_286	s	uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , ; but in any case , ; Yep . ; um , the linguistics students and stuff .
Bed010_840	s	or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so For example , is there something that we can use there . ; i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . ; Uh , so there are gonna be some some some things like that , which are not science but system . ; But we aren't gonna ignore those
Bmr007_178	b	I mean , the general cultural idea which w uh , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th before you start talking , ; and and you know , I mean , w we know that an and they 've loosened up on that too s in the intervening time , that that that 's that 's viewed as being a culturally - relative thing , ; I mean , that you have the high - involvement style from the East Coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying . ; Uh - huh .
Bro014_1176	s	Right . ; Mm - hmm . ; for the difference ; and this is the difference .
Bmr020_313	s	You have a lot of a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting . ; Right . ; Uh - huh . ; Well regardless
Bro025_432	s	Uh - huh . ; Yeah . ; It ; Well . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement .
Buw001_2210	s	I I found this discussion very , uh , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . ; And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be ; because it depends on what your purpose is . ; So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting .
Bmr008_878	no	Well I I g ; OK . ; so . ; I don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now ,
Bns001_1150	g	That those type of application you m may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something . ; Could that be something , ; or ? ; Also we want to go more in the triple - A area . Right ?
Bmr027_391	s	Right ? ; So ; You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end . ; Need to get it right .
Bro021_1220	g	it 's not exactly this . ; It 's modify . ; Uh , if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech , we have a probability f of our our weight for each Gaussian . ; No .
Bed006_990	s	Um we have absolute ; No . ; We have absolutely no means of enforcing that , ; so it would be considered valid if we have an SPG action " Enter " and no SPG schema , but a forced action schema .
Bmr016_394	co	I mean , here , let 's try it . ; you know , cross - talk cancellation . ; Let 's try it . ; You read the last line , I 'll read the first line .
Bed009_250	x	Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints . ; So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically , ; Mm - hmm . ; but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it .
Bed002_961	b	OK . ; So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out . ; Right . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr027_511	s	and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever , ; Right . ; and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , " have you ; Is is this OK ? And would you please mail you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . "
Bed011_620	bk	right , ; or something like that ? ; Yep . ; OK .
Bmr010_1154	%--	and it may just be , you know , pristine . ; But on the other hand , given the lesser interface ; Cuz this is , you know we 've got a good interface , ; we 've got great headphones , m
Bns003_745	s	In some subjects , in fact , eh , the the the , uh , topics are more open ; so you can introduce some research topics too . ; So ; but the main thing is that there is a , uh , this big difference
Bro012_1025	s	Mmm . ; Maybe that 's what you were thinking . ; I don't know . ; I don't know . I mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be .
Bro021_162	b	you know , helping with noisy case ; but hurting in quiet case . ; And if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that . ; Mm - hmm .
Bed006_885	b	think think of enter , view and approach as frames ; and they have frame - specific parameters and and roles ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1385	%	but we don't have this labeling for Aurora . ; We just have a labeling with word models ; but not for phonemes . ; I see .
Bed016_530	s	Mm - hmm . ; But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should , ; unless you put it in the text , ; and I don't think it 's there yet ,
Bmr012_168	s	Yeah , ; good idea . ; OK . ; Um Well , I I sent out an email s couple hours ago
Bsr001_1313	aa	They only mark the beginnings . ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bsr001_1230	b	Well ; I think I think somebody 's got a unit which is something like the ADAT or something , ; which , you know , it 's a device which will record onto tape , uh , multiple channels . ; Oh .
Bro023_1237	b	M I mean , it 's it , um ; The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean ; but then you get a different noise . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro012_1169	b	So , not the speech - nonspeech . ; Well even with e ; uh w ah ; Yeah .
Bmr020_168	s	Do you mean , ; n No . ; Oh . ; Short words .
Bmr003_1427	b	I mean , it 's very nicely thought out . ; Cool . ; They thought about ; Hmm .
Bro003_1857	co	So , I mean ; What ; I 'm sorry . ; Go ahead .
Bmr024_294	b	And that 'll be something like I it 's ver it 's interesting . ; A backchannel , or ; Once in a while it 's a backchannel . ; Yep .
Bmr012_688	s	we have n no names . ; Although I sh um ; That that 's not the issue , ; it 's just the audio data itself ,
Bro026_165	d	Yeah , ; This is ; yeah . ; This this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?
Bmr006_120	%--	Definitely . ; Yeah . ; Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . ; Because I think if you just say
Bmr021_565	b	I haven't either . ; Oh . ; No . ; Hmm .
Bmr015_840	%--	Yeah . ; I have to discover what what is the the w the best way to to to c to use them ; Well , but yeah I don't think you can I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame , ; so I mean
Bro010_744	no	Uh , so they may be you know , may be overly , uh , complicated for for this test ; but ; but but , uh , ; I don't know .
Bmr026_76	b	And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the the thing that they 're reading ; right ? ; So . ; Yeah .
Bns002_443	bk	He have to do it for all data packets ? ; Yeah . ; OK . ; OK .
Bro019_1123	d	I don't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , ; I don't have good result . ; Are similar or a little bit worse . ; With what what other new p new parameter ?
Bro005_1343	b	uh and uh and and work with it , you know , for the next round . ; Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gonna do is actually gonna completely solve the problem . ; So . ; Mmm .
Btr002_156	s	Mm - hmm . ; Oh . ; Yeah . ; So " all the slides " it 's w started too late .
Bro013_411	s	And . So I did that ; and uh it 's running . ; So , let 's see what will happen . ; Uh but the filter is of course closer to the reference filter .
Bed005_1143	bk	Mm - hmm . ; because G is a function from that to that . ; Yep . ; Right .
Bmr027_642	s	Mm - hmm . ; Right . That would that would definitely work on me . ; Yeah . ; It is the first time through the cycle .
Bns003_158	s	you download it , if that s must be possible from the network , ; but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than , uh , one box which you have on your desktop , ; cuz that is the primary , uh uh reason for this testbed . ; So , definitely you have to have web access to download the necessary files .
Bro003_241	bk	One they call the multi - language database , and another one is a twenty - two language , something like that . ; But it 's also telephone speech . ; Oh , they are ? ; OK .
Bed009_618	ar	And he 's gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner . ; Dialogue manager . ; Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ? ; No ,
Bmr006_1729	s	OK , so suppose someone says , " well I don't know if I really heard what uh , what Jose said . " ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; And then , Jose responds .
Bro014_18	t1	Great . ; We did it again , Morgan . ; Alright ! ; Doo - doop , doo - doo .
Bro026_891	aa	OK . ; I mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation , ; I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro005_350	b	Yeah . ; but uh , the uh , Italian training . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro023_145	%--	Right . ; And that 's actually what we 're planning to do in ; OK . ; But
Bmr009_295	b	And the other thing is I ; Sorry . ; I ; Yeah .
Bed005_251	b	uh , " Film " to " movie " , ; cinem " Kino " to " cinema " ; to " today " heu " heute " to " today " , ; Huh .
Bmr022_540	s	I mean , you could do it that way , ; or you could ; It 's it 's ; it would be able to handle any errors .
Bro022_60	bk	Um , my meeting ; Yeah . ; with , uh ? ; Oh , oh , you mean the the quals .
Bmr003_2286	%--	But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain , ; so you end up with this thing that ; if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be it 'd be fine . ; You wouldn't necessarily
Bmr012_139	b	Either way ; yeah I think I think age is alright ; and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that ; OK .
Bed004_400	aa	Say what you were gonna say . ; Good , do it ! ; No no , ; OK .
Bro022_1221	b	I am thinking about that and working about that , ; Yeah . ; but I don't have result this week . ; Sure .
Bmr012_914	bk	So it 's it 's it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database ; Oh , I see , ; so . ; OK .
Btr002_3031	s	and so ; I put in if it 's , um , unintelligible I put I count how many syllables and then I put in " six X " ; I do that if it 's unintelligible , ; but if I can tell something if somebody goes " r " I 'll put an " R " .
Bed012_487	qw	So no matter what they said , if I could map it onto a Where - Is construction , I could say , " ah ! ; Ge ; Mm - hmm . ; well the the intent , here , was Where - Is " ,
Bro010_1011	qw	Um , ; Yeah . ; Hmm . ; What could be the other low level detectors , I mean , for Other kind of features ,
Bmr026_231	bk	We have ; We have ? ; Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet . ; Oh .
Bns001_1447	b	And what is the trend towards UMTS to the first generation ? ; And how it is possible to map this one to this technology ? ; And if you have the building blocks identified , what is really necessary for QS eh QS - in - Advance for for mobile systems , then you have , in principle , the ideas for the following generation what you could improve . ; Hmm - hmm .
Bed010_305	s	because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . ; And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . ; So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , ; but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .
Bed009_695	s	and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in in in the DAML uh project where um you you find a GIS about that gives you information on Berkeley , ; Yeah . ; and it 's it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things . ; and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before
Bed013_1269	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; U that 's exactly r um , why I 'm proposing It 's too early to have to think of them of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe , ; Uh - huh .
Bmr028_1067	bk	because you know we 've been at this for a little while ; and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance . ; Mm - hmm . ; OK .
Bro004_907	s	oh , I don't know , ; like back vowels , front vowels . ; So what you do ; Um For the moments we do not don't have nets ,
Bed012_435	b	What does this tell us ? ; And not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local , ; because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities . ; Yeah .
Bro010_337	s	I mean , we haven't experimented with this ; but I imagine you could , um , uh , predict a , uh um , a label , uh , from more in the past than in than than in the future . ; I mean , we 've d we 've done some stuff with that before . ; I think it it works OK .
Bed013_1131	qw	Mmm . ; Hmm . Should be both , ; whereas maybe " where is X located " , we find from the data , is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is , ; and " how do I get to " is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there .
Btr002_486	b	and I realize it 's not a female even , ; but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , I 'm supposed to transcribe it . " ; I 'm supposed to do it . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro028_42	ba	And what are we sitting at currently ? ; So , currently d uh , we have system that has two hundred and thirty . ; Yeah . ; So , that 's fine .
Bed016_742	bk	and you can be , you know , on the wagon . ; Right . So so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do . ; I mean you could do something much simpler ; Yeah .
Bed006_326	s	But , thanks to Fey , we already have sort of a nice blueprint and I can work with that . ; Questions ? ; Comments on that ? ; If not , we can move on .
Bed011_449	bk	So yeah I th that seems pretty straight forward . ; But were you saying that ; I need those back by the way . ; OK .
Bmr008_1013	%--	you have you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident , ; and then you have , uh other people who are just the reverse , and and it ; Yes . ; so many things that vary I
Bro027_138	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bsr001_620	s	Well , basically , the the the original project looks a lot like , you know , the the p your project . ; I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , idea of the the the meeting the the mediated spaces idea in general ; Mm - hmm . ; and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting ,
Bns003_136	aa	So , I think it 's related to the work , um they 've done on Sunday here ; and I sent ; But normally you should have access to th all the internet , r to outside . ; Yes .
Bed015_528	b	You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of ; I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know ; assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr008_1247	s	Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway . ; So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it . ; Mmm . ; Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group
Bmr008_489	s	S Mm - hmm ; So what does Region mean ; Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing . ; and like if I see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by Region .
Bns003_639	ar	Um , I am working now on on something , ; uh an open source router . ; This is that from from Mark , right ? ; No ,
Bmr025_284	aa	This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have uh Dave Gelbart Gelbart ; Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing ; because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff ; Right .
Bmr023_1070	bk	Yeah . ; But ; And I 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that . ; Yeah .
Bro004_1042	b	Yeah . ; Um , I mean , not uniformly . ; I mean , there 's a an example or two that you can find , where it made it slightly worse , but uh in in all but a couple examples . ; Mmm .
Bmr021_479	b	sorry , ; different partitions of the same physical disk . ; Physical disk . ; Mmm .
Bmr019_805	b	I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words , ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah .
Bro019_1186	%--	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; OK . ; It 's neve e e
Bmr008_1522	b	Sure . ; But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time . ; Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it . ; Right .
Bro005_972	b	Yeah . ; I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's ; e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being is being dependent on very dependent on the kind of noise and and so forth . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_813	aa	I mean , that 's sort of my feeling about it , ; that you should be you should be able to translate between an XML and non - XML version ; cuz most at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly . ; Right .
Bed004_150	s	OK , the uh lessons learned . ; The reading needs to be shorter . ; Five minutes is just too long . ; Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order .
Bmr006_665	b	OK . ; Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk . ; Uh , OK , @ @ So , uh , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , ; Uh - huh .
Bro003_2037	bk	and determined that ; But . ; Well , Hynek said that that , I guess before they had him work on this , they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right , it dramatically improved the result . ; I see .
Bro026_216	s	uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation ; because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . ; And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . ; And that 's hard enough .
Bro022_231	bk	are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . ; Uh - huh . ; Be pretty simple . ; OK .
Bed015_442	s	Not in California . ; Yeah , that 's true . ; Yes . ; I like I I like spending fourth of July in other countries , whenever I can .
Bro024_1090	b	Mmm . ; Mmm . ; No , I think I I used this scheme as it was before . ; OK .
Bed011_981	bk	Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when . ; OK . OK . ; Nothing to write home about . ; OK .
Bmr020_201	s	Um , ; well it was about it had three sections ; You sent it to me ; but I haven't seen it yet .
Bmr015_189	%--	Yeah . ; Um um , ; that 's the only thought I have ; because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr
Bmr014_257	b	Right ? ; Their maintenance people . ; Well , we 'll see what it it 's like . ; Yep .
Bro003_1276	s	on the other hand , almost anything that really i you know , is is new , where we 're saying , " Well , let 's look at , like we were talking before about , uh , uh , voiced - unvoiced - silence detection features and all those sort " that 's ; Yeah . ; I think it 's a great thing to go to . ; But if it 's new , then we have this development and and and learning process t to to go through on top of just the the all the all the work .
Bmr023_453	cc	Yeah . ; Yeah . ; Also if you need someone to record this meeting , I mean , I 'm happy to for the transcribers ; I could do it , or Chuck or Adam .
Bed005_1089	g	And the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these , ; so we don't need to specify any probabilities . ; We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? ; So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ?
Bed015_2144	%--	Well , no , but it matters a lot ; In ; because you what you want are these generalized rules ; about the way things relate ,
Bns002_700	s	OK ? ; So , the point is uh , we cannot say that this is not gonna happen , ; what we can say is this is not very likely to happen , if nodes move uh uh random . ; Yeah , but um Miguel , if uh in the previous slide you mentioned that you uh are working also on adaptive power control .
Bmr015_473	b	or other things that are ending , ; Right . ; so , ; Mm - hmm .
Btr001_802	s	Got it . ; Sorry . ; Have you ; I guess I 'm the only non - linguist .
Bro027_2055	b	The meeting in is the five and six of December . ; p s It 's like Yeah , it 's tentatively all full . ; So ; Yeah .
Bro021_1121	s	Mmm ? ; And when w ; the way to obtain the PDF for the noisy speech is ; well , we know this statistic
Bro014_651	s	and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features , ; and anybody doing this task , uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . ; They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing , ; but but they 'll have it on some level .
Bro010_586	aa	But what is the ; it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . ; I mean , depending on where the window was that you used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio . ; Yeah ,
Bed004_592	bk	so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the X - schema ? ; For for for ; Yes . ; OK .
Bmr006_443	s	Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , " Give them a music CD , " like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech ; Oh . ; and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , ; but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting ,
Bro028_1175	s	Hmm . ; I don't know . ; Um , and I 'm gonna to try to to look at those patterns to to see , um , from those patterns ; uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes .
Bmr028_564	b	That 's good . ; but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing not no speech between those . ; Hmm . ; Hmm .
Bro021_437	b	Mm - hmm . ; Never tested it with the compensation , ; but without , uh , compensation it was like fifteen was s slightly better than thirteen , ; Yeah .
Bro012_810	qw	This is still being a plot of C - zero ? ; Yeah . This is still C - zero . ; OK . ; Can I ask um what does variance normalization do ?
Bmr002_1246	s	Well , Dan 's got an open notebook , too . ; discuss discuss among yourselves . ; Outrageous ! ; Laying out his folders .
Bsr001_1388	b	But I think having the the idea of the computer sort of in there forces you to create a a log file format that can handle these other devices . ; Hmm . ; Right . ; Right .
Bro013_590	aa	Yeah . ; What 's this again ? ; Is it the mel - filters ? ; Yeah like this .
Bns001_890	%--	So we have to think about an application which which is um um , for mobile users , more relevant . ; I don't know . ; Maybe video games . ; If you are traveling
Bmr006_973	s	Right . ; I I I will include too the the the differential de derivates too . ; Yeah . ; Deltas ,
Bed005_177	qw	But , um . ; Well , that sounds ; Uh do don't worry about it . ; It could be " this evening , which which films are on the cinema " ,
Bmr006_760	t1	I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . ; Mm - hmm . ; Eh , I mean , the class you will overlapping speech " overlapping " is a class , eh , " speech " @ @ the class that 's ; Nonspeech .
Bed002_969	s	So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . ; Um . ; The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it ; so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .
Bed017_449	s	which does exactly this , ; but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . ; And so , uh what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , ; and and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with .
Bro018_706	s	So I ha haven't hunted down all the all the mistakes yet , ; Uh - huh . ; but ; But a as I was saying , people do get probabilities from these things ,
Bmr019_1068	b	where ; and CallHome , ; where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , you know , is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr022_250	b	because the person ; Well ; I mean , if that 's some of the errors , those would probably stay the same , regardless . ; Yep .
Bro017_706	b	So you 'd actually ; You have to do bo both . ; Because essentially you are saying " uh this feature is not important " . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro007_558	s	rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out . ; Mm - hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; The fact that none of these are are you know , enormous is is is not too surprising
Bns003_1000	d	Where it should be ada @ @ where should be , uh , the adaptation process performed to deal with the different devices , for ubiquitous access to the network ? ; Should it be in the end system itself ? ; Should be in the edge device ? ; It should it be in the core ?
Bmr031_1350	s	and ; But is it still true that basically the s speaker adaptation , um , sort of negates much of the advantage ? ; Sometimes . Yeah . ; No , I 'm talking about with the adaptation .
Bed014_976	2	So you 're proposing that we meet Tuesday . ; How about that ? ; I I could ; Next week .
Bro019_443	h	But , you know . It 's it 's still someth reasonable . ; So , are people supposed to assume that there is uh ; Are are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ? ; Uh
Bmr016_1035	s	Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ? ; Huh . ; Yeah . ; Oh , I 'm tr talking about Transcriber .
Bro012_1262	b	So that 's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector . ; They didn't . ; So we 're talking about something a little different . ; Mmm .
Bmr030_418	b	And we might wanna do that anyway . ; Because it seems like that 's being a bottleneck and that 's silly . ; It shouldn't be a bottleneck . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2680	b	Yeah . ; Right . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bro012_1425	s	um , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall . ; And um , so um ; Another person 's voice . ; what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding
Bro016_554	b	it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on Italian , uh , data and then , uh , we tested on Danish data and it did terribly , uh , that that it would look bad . ; And I think someone would notice ; and would say " Well , look . This is not generalizing . " ; Mm - hmm .
Bmr014_1094	%--	So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and ; then we bleep it . ; OK . ; Alright , so I think
Bmr028_1476	b	Yeah . ; Mmm . ; Like , that 's another one I see all the time , where you assume it 's known . ; Yeah . Sure .
Bmr015_1067	s	because in in discourse and linguistic research , what counts is what 's communit communicative . ; Mm - hmm . ; And breath , ; you know , everyone breathes ,
Bmr023_749	b	So we 're just getting better signals in in this data . ; Which is nice . ; So . ; Yeah .
Bed008_159	%--	OK . ; And it 's so simple even I can use it . ; Wow , that is simple . ; OK , so here was
Bmr021_422	b	because you don't have that wasted that extra copy . ; Right . Right we I mean the original Switchboard files are not compressed , ; So . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_607	b	Mm - hmm . ; Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype . ; Yeah . ; Yeah .
Bmr025_146	s	i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . ; So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time ; OK . ; so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents .
Bns003_260	aa	uh so that we can update these last @ @ you know @ @ present the last major part of the web pages . ; The pages are already on the web ? ; OK . ; Yeah , yeah .
Bmr029_529	ba	It doesn't make that much difference , I think . ; but ; I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that . ; So , I mean , I I think that that difference would definitely be marginal .
Buw001_1423	s	uh , and also moving on to action items and other things , ; let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , ; um , that we at least decided on . ; CrossPads we were going to try ,
Bro022_622	%--	So you you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . ; Right ? ; Um . Uh - huh . ; And
Bmr013_268	s	Yeah . ; Points of articulation ? ; What do you mean ? ; So , is it , uh , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal .
Btr001_2322	bh	To " so " , ; yeah . ; I think so too . ; Huh .
Bmr019_1741	s	eh , and e i I mean , if , eh , the topic is , eh , so difficult , ; uh , in my opinion , there isn't ; Yeah . Maybe somebody else will come along and will be , uh , interested in working on it ; and could start off from where you are also , you know .
Bro028_988	s	So there are M possible subsets of this length - M vector . ; He tries classifying , using each of the M possible sub - vectors . ; Hmm . ; Whichever sub - vector , um , works the the best , I guess , he says the the fe feature that didn't use was the most useless feature ,
Bmr025_205	b	But you were saying that that the uh that there 's that set of tools , uh , Cygnus tools , that ; So . ; It certainly helps . ; Uh - huh .
Bro028_709	s	So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that . ; Mm - hmm . ; I d I don't know . ; But , I mean , I guess we still haven't had a a ruling back on this .
Bmr025_197	%--	So if we wanna just do a video - based one I think that 'll be easy . ; Mm - hmm . ; If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work ; because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's um ,
Bmr028_1751	b	we can afford we can a ; We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have energies diverted . ; Hmm . ; Yeah .
Bed002_1030	s	Well , anyway . f Get one . ; OK ? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , ; doesn't matter which one , ; uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities ,
Bed015_1548	%--	not just like the top part . ; Right . ; I I think , uh ; That 's
Bro018_204	qw	Hmm . ; Yeah , ; it 's probably worth it . ; What are what are your f uh frame error rates for for this ?
Bmr027_577	s	Hmm . ; Mm - hmm . ; You know , they 're all more or less here ; or it 's it 's Eric and Dan and so on .
Bmr005_1125	s	Brian 's Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . ; Right ? ; Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . ; We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position ,
Bro023_672	bk	yeah . ; Yeah . ; It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise . ; Uh - huh .
Bed006_1768	b	Mm - hmm . ; uh " rich " is also great , ; rwww . ; Hmm .
Bmr012_324	b	And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that can't be right ; Oh . ; yeah sounds like a bug . ; Yeah .
Bmr009_68	ft	I mean , the means of what ? ; Uh B Between between ; All the frames in the conversation ? ; Thanks .
Bns002_39	s	Yeah . ; OK . ; Thank - thank you . ; I 'm uh working in the Broadband Communications Group
Bro003_364	s	And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch . ; And they may very well be right , ; but I I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true . ; If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much .
Bmr024_413	b	Alright . ; So le let 's make sure we do the ones that that , uh , saved you . ; Yeah . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_829	s	Your likelihood would be low , ; right ? ; Mm - hmm . ; Because you would be providing severe mismatch .
Btr002_1068	no	But then like , um , it takes me a good , like , ten minutes to get re - used to that keyboard . ; Yeah . ; And so I keep ; I don't know .
Bmr005_1278	qy	Yeah . ; Uh ; anyway , I shouldn't say too much , ; but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person .
Bro027_1081	aa	So we 're only improving the training of our feature set , ; but that 's still probably something . ; So you 're saying , add the Macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? The tandem net ? ; Yeah ,
Bed013_277	s	We we we we g ; Wait , who ? ; Yeah , i that would the g the bald guy . ; Oh ! My advisor !
Bmr016_961	s	and all the men , and all the women . ; and it 's ; Yeah . ; That 's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time ,
Bmr008_34	qo	but I don't think there 's much to say about that except we 've sent it in and we 'll see what happens ; um Anybody ? ; Anything ? ; Anything else going on ?
Bed006_152	aa	Yeah . ; uh ; So it was really Carol Snow who was confused , not me and not Jerry . ; Yep , yep , yep .
Bed017_73	s	And , so , ; " should be " means they aren't yet , ; but but I think I have the info now that I need . ; Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow ,
Bmr023_265	bk	Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something . ; Yeah . Huh ! Maybe . ; And she said it wasn't gonna the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep . ; OK .
Bmr026_1174	%--	In the small training set ? ; Hello ? ; I I think so . ; I 'll
Bed014_673	bk	Yeah , I th th ; Yeah . ; Well , and and and the simple idea is that it 's on it 's only for m for the current uh , tourist e entity of instre interest . ; Yeah .
Btr002_2400	b	Mm - hmm . ; and he 's calculating it in his mind . ; So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing . ; Hmm .
Bro024_1568	g	And due to this the thresholds should be ; Yeah . ; the the a the noise addition should be lower ; But in I mean , in the real thing you 're not gonna be able to measure what people are doing over half an hour or an hour , or anything , right ?
Bed012_611	s	Nancy ? ; Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh , calculation of marks and assigning of grades , ; but I don't know if she should be here . ; Well or , she should be free after that ,
Bmr005_775	qy	Right . ; and we could Uh ; it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . ; You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better ,
Bro018_1185	bk	um a bunch of different sources , ; some digits , ; there 's some digits training in there . ; OK .
Bro024_209	%--	I don't know . ; And and th the third thing , um , uh , is , um , Barry explained LDA filtering to me yesterday . ; And so , um , Mike Shire in his thesis um , did a a series of experiments , um , training LDA filters in d on different conditions . ; And you were interested in having me repeat this for
Bro004_414	qy	we get ; Yeah , that would be interesting . ; Um , This may have been what I was asking before , Stephane , ; but but , um , wasn't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ?
Bed009_244	s	at least we want to offer the extra information . We don't really um we 're not too worried . ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; I mean t s Ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later .
Bed005_483	%--	but it does speak English . ; And there is , here , a reference ; So , this tells us that whatever is has the ID " zero " is referenced here by @ @ the restriction seed ; and this is exa " I want "
Bed011_770	bk	OK . ; But hopefully you don't ask you know , a all these things all the time . ; Or eh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking . ; Yeah .
Bmr002_675	aa	Yeah . ; So , ; Yeah , ; that 's true .
Bmr016_1217	ba	The the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to " because " , ; and so if we know that " CUZ " ; Well , ; That 's fine .
Bed015_1735	bk	You can , th ; put just the phrase " I think " as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth . ; Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions ; Yeah .
Bed002_322	s	and you more f more highly photographed . ; Then of course the the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . ; Um . Sometimes I found in the Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that that m may also give us a hint , ; um , " I 'm trying to get to "
Bro005_1326	s	and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . ; Mmm . ; And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set ; and the training targets ,
Bmr012_306	bk	Mmm . ; but there was a ; I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect . ; Oh .
Bmr009_397	s	This is a s a general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the i ; Yeah . ; So it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that . ; Well I I I I would s actually still recommend that he do the overall thing
Bro012_152	bk	It 's not the square . ; OK . ; Uh . What else wh what 's what else is going on ? ; Uh , yeah .
Bro004_876	s	but again we have the hope that it We have the hope that it maybe it 's not making too much difference , ; Yeah . ; But We can ; know soon .
Bmr015_312	s	Um ; And they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms , ; u ; Tomorrow .
Bns001_184	s	No , ; but this is oh , uh Everybody 's obliged to do it for his own , you know . ; Yeah . ; So there is not uh Claudia is not the webmaster here to , uh , get the collection for for for everything .
Bro019_1455	s	And she would get back to me on Monday . ; So that 's that 's only thing I have ; and Diane has a few more houses . ; She 's going to take some pictures and send me after I go back .
Bed014_819	%	Actually , ; yeah . There 's a problem with that word , too , though . ; Yeah , but it he the decisions I made wer had to do with my thesis . ; Yeah .
Bro013_498	s	It 's height . ; but it but it g ; Yeah . ; with noise of course
Bns003_848	s	So you have um distributed routing at the edges , ; and one aspect is that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the exact information of your links , dates , and so on . ; It what we have plans of that . ; And trying to look at some routing policies , or routing algorithms .
Bed015_1709	b	Yeah , that 's why I said " point to Robert " , when I did it . ; Well every time Nancy giggles it means it means that it 's your job . ; Uh . ; Yeah .
Bmr010_333	ba	Uh - huh . ; then when they 're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know , the start points and end points of overlaps . ; Yeah . ; uh Th - they 're making really quick progress .
Bed015_1651	s	Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL ; where , you know , you 're signing ; and someone says something . ; And then , you know , so " he say " , and then you sort of do a role shift .
Bmr020_1642	qw	and and you have a b a bunch of different dominant speakers ; Oh yeah , ; interesting . ; you know , how are you gonna handle it .
Bed005_1163	%--	Is ; Mmm . ; Oh , right . ; W would not be ab able to observe
Bed010_945	s	So , de Uh . And her name is Eva . ; OK . ; It really is . ; Nobody believed th th that
Bmr002_1354	aa	Well I think the answer is we need to record as many as we can . ; OK . ; Right ? I don't see any reason not to try to record a meeting or two a week . ; Absolutely .
Bmr029_461	%--	OK . ; Oh , OK . ; So , does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it ? Or you just let it do what it would do , an ? ; No . It means No . It just means
Bro012_1481	s	Um . ; Actually I I s we didn't I guess I wrote this in after the meeting ; b but the thought I had was um looking at the language model that 's used in the HTK recognizer , ; which is basically just a big loop ,
Bed016_706	s	and then it 's construed as something , ; and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the to the domain . ; OK , f let 's let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " . ; I mean , that 's what you started with .
Bmr031_639	ft	Hey , it 's it 's the first time I 've ever heard you ask for less data . ; Hmm . ; It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short . ; Sorry . Thanks , Morgan .
Btr001_441	%--	Yeah . ; and I notice it 's more and more difficult . ; Mm - hmm . ; There 's another language that 's spoken in Spain too , that 's um ,
Bro022_1079	aa	or something like that . ; So maybe I 'll ; This is cubic root of power spectra ? ; Yeah .
Bed011_811	s	Right , that 's true . ; Right . ; The what what my sort of sentiment is they 're ; Well , I I once had to write a a a a charter , a carter for a a student organization .
Bro018_776	aa	So I 'm I 'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff . ; Mmm . ; So they had one recurrent net for each particular feature ? ; Right .
Bed006_386	b	No . ; Just sort of OK , what what what would you like to buy ; and then um OK there you wanna buy a whatever cuckoos clocks ; Yeah .
Bro003_1055	%--	There 's a computation limit , though , ; isn't there ? ; Yeah , ; I mean , it 's just more compu
Bro017_586	bs	Ma - nec to need a little more time to improve the English , and maybe s to fill in something some small detail , something like that , ; Mm - hmm . ; Hmm . ; but it 's more or less ready .
Bmr001_697	ba	I think they would . ; And also he 's he 's he 's got at least one woman . ; That 's great . ; Oh , that 's a good point !
Bed002_152	s	So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . ; And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously ; so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones ; and do research like that .
Bro016_623	b	Yeah . ; Mm - hmm . ; Yeah . ; That 's true .
Bro003_1050	%--	No , no , ; I 'm I 'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net . ; Do you have to worry about keeping that the same , ; or ?
Bro021_477	s	Um , so I 'm I 'm thinking about , um , starting some , uh , cheating experiments to , uh , determine the , um the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that I want to classify . ; So , for example , um , if I know where voicing occurs and everything , um , I would do a phone um , phone recognition experiment , ; um , somehow putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that I have about voicing . ; So , um , in particular I was thinking , um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those LNA files , and , um , setting to zero those probabilities that , um that these phones are not voicing .
Bmr009_588	ba	because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll turn out ; Yeah . ; and , You know , it 's always an interesting question . ; I would think it 's interesting , yeah .
Bro019_1033	s	Guenter Hirsch and TI . ; OK . ; Maybe Roger ; r Roger , maybe in charge of .
Bro021_94	s	but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else . ; Oh . ; So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have frame dropping , but we don't frame ev uh , drop everything , ; but uh , this can hurts the estimation of the mean for speech ,
Bed008_953	s	but something like that . ; Now it 's gonna be important not to have loops by the way . ; I was just gonna ; Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops
Bmr010_916	s	To go on forever ? ; r can go on forever . ; And how do you handle it in the language model ? ; It 's just a it 's just a word .
Bmr006_676	s	And I have , eh , some ideas . ; Eh , this information is very very useful . ; I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it . ; Because you have the the the distribution , now .
Bro003_825	aa	I see . ; Yeah . ; y And I think Stephane was saying there 's there 's some broader s material in the French also ? ; Yeah ,
Bro025_18	b	Yeah . ; Excellent . ; That 's the best thing . ; Mm - hmm .
Bro017_522	qw	Wow . ; Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people . ; Wow . ; Where 's uh Guenter going ?
Bed008_1024	s	Yeah . ; But uh OK I was just thinking ; Yeah . ; I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user
Bmr031_1235	%--	Yeah . I built a few built a few houses . ; Um , ; but right now I guess , uh , I 'm working on this paper this ISCA paper for this workshop that Liz and Andreas and I are putting together . ; So we 're just getting , uh , different results for
Bmr016_714	s	So it would be ; and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak ; OK . ; So do sort of what he 's already what he 's trying to do .
Bed008_1185	%--	Well , here he here 's one of the things that that I th you sh ; you no , ; I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface ; but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time uh all the things that you pick up ,
Bed005_1318	s	uh ; But it 's , uh Well , it strikes me as a What For ; If we get the mechanism , that will be sort of the wonderful part . ; And then , how to make it work is is the second part ,
Bro021_63	s	and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector . ; Mmm . ; This actually don't s doesn't seem to help , ; although it doesn't hurt .
Buw001_95	s	and ; what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? ; Like ; Uh , especially for querying .
Bro003_222	s	Telephone . ; Yeah . ; Yeah , but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the ; Well , you don't do not send speech , you send features , computed on th the the device ,
Bmr016_664	s	and we were gonna ask him if if there 're you know , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that . ; Not that we were gonna do it , ; but we wanted to know what would need to be done . ; And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . "
Bed003_1416	b	and then get s some more information and then you see " here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into " . ; It it might be useful here too . ; I I don't know how ; Mm - hmm .
